VTAM dynamic reconfiguration

VTAM provides a dynamic reconfiguration facility to allow
changes to be made to the NCP without having to perform an
NCP generation.  This article discusses dynamic
reconfiguration in detail and provides examples of how to
reconfigure an NCP and some of its associated resources
dynamically.


WHAT DYNAMIC RECONFIGURATION CAN OFFER

A variety of operations can be performed using the dynamic
reconfiguration commands supplied as part of the VTAM
product.  You can perform all of the following functions:

1      On non-switched SDLC lines, the addition and deletion of
      type 1, type 2.0, and type 2.1 physical units.  Any LUs
      associated with these devices can also be added or deleted
      using dynamic reconfiguration.

2      The addition and deletion of logical units on non-switched
      SDLC lines.

3      For VTAM Version 3.2 or above, the movement of a PU
      and its associated LUs from one line to another within a
      single NCP.

4      For VTAM Version 3.2 or above, the changing of a PU's
      SDLC address.

At present you cannot move an LU from one PU to another;
however you can delete the LU and then add it as required.
Certain rules exist pertaining to dynamic reconfiguration.  The
following table summarizes these rules.

Operation      NCP      Line      PU      LU      Description
ADD PU      ACT      any      N/A      N/A      add physical unit
ADD LU      ACT      any      either      N/A      add logical unit
DEL PU      ACT      any      INACT      INACT      delete physical unit
DEL LU      ACT      any      either      INACT      delete logical unit
MOVE PU      ACT      any      INACT      INACT      move physical unit

Obviously there will be implications on performing dynamic
reconfiguration operations.  Installation standards and change
control procedures should be designed to allow usage of
dynamic reconfiguration in a controlled environment.  These
procedures should allow dynamic reconfiguration to be
performed without impacting production resources.  You
should also be aware that any changes made using the dynamic
reconfiguration options are only valid until VTAM is reloaded.

DEFINING RECONFIGURATION MAJOR NODES
Dynamic reconfiguration is achieved by filing VTAM
definition statements in special VTAM major nodes.  These are
placed in the VTAM dataset named SYS1.VTAMLST.  A
special VTAM vary command is issued from the operator's
console to activate the dynamic reconfiguration programs.
With VTAMVersion 3.2,and later releases, a new VTAM
modify command can be used to reconfigure resources
dynamically without first having to create a special major node.
The format of the VTAM vary command is as follows:

      VARY NET,DRDS,ID=drname

To use this command, a previously defined dynamic
reconfiguration major node must exist in SYS1.VTAMLST.
The major node containing the statements required to perform
the dynamic reconfiguration should be placed in the command
instead of the drname parameter.  The format of the the new
modify command is:

MODIFY NET,
       DR,
       TYPE=MOVE | DELETE,
       FROM=puname | linename,
       ID=puname | luname,
       TO=linename,
       ACTIVATE=YES | NO,
       ADDR=char

For further details about these commands you should refer to
the VTAM Operation Manual SC23-0113.

Examples of VTAM dynamic reconfiguration major node
definitions are shown below.  These definitions should always
begin with the VBUILD TYPE=DR macro.


EXAMPLE ONE: ADDING AN LU TO A PU

This example adds an LU ( VTAM001) to a PU (VTAMP0).

DR1      VBUILD TYPE=DR
         ADD    TO=VTAMP0
VTAM001  LU     LOCADDR=6,
**** code any other required operands here ****


EXAMPLE TWO: ADDING A PU TO A LINE

This example adds a PU (VTAMP1) to line LVTM1.

DR2      VBUILD TYPE=DR
         ADD    TO=LVTM1
VTAMP1   PU     ADDR=C1,
**** code any other required operands here ****


EXAMPLE THREE:DELETING AN LU FROM A PU

This example is used to delete the resource added in example
one.

EDR3      VBUILD TYPE=DR
         DELETE FROM=VTAMP0
VTAM001  LU


EXAMPLE FOUR: DELETING A PU FROM A LINE

This example is used to delete the resource added in example two.

DR4      VBUILD TYPE=DR
         DELETE FROM=LVTM1
VTAMP1   PU


EXAMPLE FIVE: MOVING A PU FROM ONE LINE TO ANOTHER

This example is used to move a PU (VTM01) from line
LVTM1 to the line LVTM2.

DR5      VBUILD TYPE=DR
         MOVE   TO=LVTM2,FROM=LVTM1
VTM01    PU


EXAMPLE SIX: CHANGING A PU'S ADDR VALUE

This example is used to move a PU (VTM01) from LVTM1 to
the line  LVTM2 and change the PU's ADDR operand to C3.
A 'MOVE' operation can only be specified for PUs.

DR6      VBUILD TYPE=DR
         MOVE   TO=LVTM2,FROM=LVTM1
VTM01    PU     ADDR=C3


RECOMMENDATIONS

For an ADD operation you should code PU and LU statements
as you would normally for NCP definitions.  You should
explicitly code any desired operands from the GROUP, LINE,
and PU macros as sifting of these operands does not take effect
for the resources being added.

Code PUs and LUs in the same major node when they will be
associated with each other.  This is the most efficient method.
Try and use the minimum number of dynamic reconfiguration
major nodes.

When deleting resources you do not need to code any operands
on the PU and LU macros.  You should code only the PU and
LU names along with the associated macro for the device being
deleted.  If you delete a PU, any resources associated with it
will be deleted.

To activate the example DR major nodes you would have to
issue the following operator commands:

VARY NET,DRDS,ID=DR1
VARY NET,DRDS,ID=DR2
VARY NET,DRDS,ID=DR3
VARY NET,DRDS,ID=DR4
VARY NET,DRDS,ID=DR5
VARY NET,DRDS,ID=DR6

VTAM will respond with the relevant messages informing you
of the outcome of the dynamic reconfiguration attempt.  You
can verify that the operation has completed successfully by
issuing the relevant VTAM display commands against the
resources that you have modified.  The devices that have been
reconfigured will appear in the display if they have been added,
or should not appear if they have been deleted.  The status field
for any devices that have been added should be suffixed with a
'D'.  This identifies the devices as dynamically reconfigured.
The most important point to remember is that the change will
only be valid until a VTAM reload takes place.  To ensure that
the change is made permanently you must perform an NCP
generation prior to the next VTAM reload.


MODIFY DR COMMAND USAGE

The MODIFY DR command was introduced with VTAM
version 3.2.  It allows delete and move operations to be
performed without creating a special dynamic reconfiguration
major node definition.  The last four examples presented above
could be performed using the following:

F NET,DR,TYPE=DELETE,FROM=VTAMP0,ID=VTAM001
F NET,DR,TYPE=DELETE,FROM=LVTM1,ID=VTAMP1
F NET,DR,TYPE=MOVE,FROM=LVTM1,TO=LVTM2,ID=VTM01
F NET,DR,TYPE=MOVE,FROM=LVTM2,TO=LVTM1,ID=VTM01,ADDR=C3

Obviously this method of performing dynamic reconfiguration
is an improvement as you do not have to define major node
definitions.  The changes made with the MODIFY DR
command are still only valid until VTAM is reloaded.
