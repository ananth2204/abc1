USS tables and the buffer operand

In the past it has always been possible to define the VTAM
Unformatted System Services (USS) tables so that a 'welcome'
message is displayed when a terminal is activated.  The advent
of software products to perform as VTAM front ends has seen
USS table usage decline.

For people who still use USS tables IBM has addressed
problems that have existed since the tables were first designed.
In the past you could define a single-line 'welcome' message
that contained the terminal name of the device where the
message was displayed.  This was very useful as it meant that
labels did not have to be placed on terminals.  It also meant
that when hardware was replaced or re-plugged the new
terminal name would automatically be displayed.  When a user
contacted the help desk they immediately knew what their
terminal number was and the network operator could then
resolve the problem quickly.  It was also possible to define a
USS table that issued a buffer to the terminal that it was
associated with.  This buffer normally consisted of some sort of
company logo.  The only drawback with this method was that
you could not display the terminal name as part of the buffer.
This led to all sorts of problems when a user contacted the help
desk.

IBM has APARs detailing PTFs that can be used to resolve this
problem.  The APARs in question are OY24252, OY27028,
and OY34983.  These APARs detail how PTFs UY50226,
UY50228, UY55731, and UY55732 can be used to allow you
to display a terminal name as part of a USS buffer screen.

We have implemented these changes to our USS tables and
find that user contact with the help desk is less confusing when
trying to determine what terminal the user is trying to access.
