6611 delays create third-party opportunities

The delivery delays on IBM's new 6611 Network Processor are
unfortunate, but they underline the fact that IBM is exploring
unfamiliar territory with its new device. The 6611 is important,
in that it puts IBM's seal of approval on the multi-protocol
router market, currently dominated by companies like Cisco
and Wellfleet. Once it starts shipping, the IBM device is likely
to establish a new standard, both for multi-port source route
bridging between Token Rings and for routing across open
networks.

The 6611 incorporates a number of new technologies,
including the Data Link Switching technique for encapsulating
unroutable SNA and NETBIOS traffic. Presumably
performance is not yet up to a marketable standard, and IBM is
wise to delay shipment until the Network Processor is ready.

Early test sites have found that the 6611 offers superior
handling of SNA and Token Ring traffic. The only concern
from IBM's point of view will be that Cisco and Crosscom are
catching up fast in this area: a long delay on the 6611 may
reduce IBM's share of a very significant market.
