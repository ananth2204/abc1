Network performance management tools

This article takes a look at what products are available in the
field of network performance management tools and gives a
brief description of the main products in this area.  The
information comes mainly from the suppliers' own publicity
material, personal experience, and Xephon research.  It is not
intended to be a comprehensive buyer's guide, simply an
introduction to some of the products currently available.  The
range of facilities offered by each of the products below varies
enormously and this will be reflected in their prices.  Some of
the following products compete directly with each other, while
others only contain a subset of the facilities of (usually) more
expensive products.

BESTnet Boundary Product is a set of tools for the
performance management of the SNA boundary network,
BESTnet MSNF Product is a set of tools for the performance

COMPARISONS

The October 1990 issue of Xephon's IBEX Bulletin (a regular
series of surveys into the IBM mainframe community) found
that of those sites with a network performance monitor,
NetView PM had nearly 70% of the market and NetSpy 21%.
No other products showed in sufficient numbers for them to be
assessed individually.  Ratings for the products told a different
story however.  NetSpy was rated considerably better than
NetView PM in every category covered by the survey, namely:
value for money, support, ease of use, reliability, performance
overhead, and range of measurements.


CONCLUSION

IBEX also found that only 24% of all IBM mainframe sites
have a network performance monitor, rising to 44% for MVS
sites, indicating that this should be a reasonably good area for
software vendors to focus their sales efforts.  We do not expect
the present two horse race to continue for much longer.
Omegamon II for VTAM is a relative newcomer on the scene
but shows all the potential one would expect from a Candle
product.  It will be interesting to see whether Landmark
Systems can repeat the success they have had with The Monitor
for CICS, in this market.
