VTAM extended display command

When we installed NetView at our installation, our operators
requested us to write a NetView CLIST to allow more than one
terminal to be displayed at once.  We did this for Version 1.2
of NetView.  When we installed Version 1.3, I re-wrote the
CLIST in REXX.  The following program allows the operators
to display several terminals at once.  They find this useful
when dealing with help desk queries relating to multi-session
terminals.  The command should be issued in the following format:

      BDISEX term1 term2

where term1 is the first terminal to be displayed and term2 the
last terminal.  The command works on the principle that the
last two characters of the terminal's name are numeric.  For
example, if the operator issued BDISEX STE00012 STE00015,
it would result in a display at the NetView console of terminals
STE00012, STE00013, STE00014, and STE00015.  This
command could be adapted to other installations' naming
conventions if necessary.  We have found the command to be
very useful for our operations and help desk personnel.

/* REXX EXEC BDISEX */
ARG P1 P2
INCR = 0
IF P1 = '' THEN
   DO
    SAY 'PARAMETER ONE IS MISSING....REXX EXEC TERMINATING.'
    EXIT
   END
IF P2 = '' THEN
   DO
    SAY 'PARAMETER TWO IS MISSING....REXX EXEC TERMINATING.'
    EXIT
   END
P3 = LENGTH(P1)
IF P3 > 8 THEN
   DO
    SAY 'LENGTH OF PARAMETER ONE > MAXIMUM....REXX EXEC TERMINATING.'
    EXIT
   END
P3 = LENGTH(P2)
IF P3 > 8 THEN
   DO
    SAY 'LENGTH OF PARAMETER TWO > MAXIMUM....REXX EXEC TERMINATING.'
    EXIT
   END
STRTFLD = SUBSTR(P1,7,2)
ENDFLD = SUBSTR(P2,7,2)
CNT = ENDFLD - STRTFLD
IF CNT < 0 THEN
   DO
    SAY 'ERROR IN SECOND PARAMETER....REXX EXEC TERMINATING.'
    EXIT
   END
DO WHILE INCR Â¬> CNT
   ADDRESS NETVIEW "DIS "||P1
   INCR = INCR + 1
   P2 = SUBSTR(P1,7,2)
   P2 = P2 + 1
   IF LENGTH(P2) < 2 THEN
      DO
       P2 = 0||P2
      END
   P1 = SUBSTR(P1,1,6)||P2
END
EXIT
