Pre-loading NetView CLISTs into storage

To improve the performance of our NetView system I have
implemented procedures at our installation to pre-load NetView
CLISTs into storage.  These procedures use the LOADCL,
DROPCL, and MAPCL commands.  If NetView CLISTs are
not pre-loaded into storage, every time a CLIST is issued it is
retrieved from DASD storage, executed, and then dropped
from storage.  For commands such as RECYCLE and DIS this
can occur several hundred times a day.  Pre-loading NetView
CLISTs overcomes this problem and increases their
performance.  The commands that are used to achieve this
operation and to monitor the operation are documented in the
NetView Operation manual.


LOADCL COMMAND

This can be used to pre-load CLISTs into storage, and to reload
a previously-loaded CLIST into storage after the CLIST has
been amended.

The format of the command is:

      LOADCL clistname,clistname,(REPLACE)

At our installation we issue the LOADCL command for a
number of frequently-used CLISTs at NetView start-up.  I have
provided examples of the command below.

Examples of LOADCL commands

1      LOADCL DIS

      Response: CNM406I COMMAND LIST DIS LOADED

      The previous command will load the CLIST named DIS
      into storage.

2      LOADCL DIS

      Response: CNM408I COMMAND LIST DIS ALREADY
      LOADED - REPLACE NOT SPECIFIED

      Because the CLIST DIS has already been loaded, the
      LOADCL command should be issued as shown in the following example.

3      LOADCL DIS,(REPLACE)

      Response: CNM411I COMMAND LIST CNME1023
      DROPPED CNM406I COMMAND LIST DIS LOADED

      Note how the CLIST's real name appears in the CNM411I
      message.  This format of the command should be used
      when the CLIST has been updated.

4      LOADCL START

      Response: CNM414I CLIST START NOT LOADED -
      NOT A VALID CLIST

      Because START is not a CLIST the load attempt fails.
      Only CLISTs can be pre-loaded into storage:


DROPCL COMMAND

The DROPCL command can be used to drop all pre-loaded
CLISTs or an individual CLIST.  It takes the format:

      DROPCL *                   - drop all CLISTs from storage.
      DROPCL clistname,clistname - drop only those CLISTs specified.


MAPCL COMMAND

The MAPCL command provides you with the ability to
monitor usage of those CLISTs that have been pre-loaded into
storage.  Figure 1 shows a sample output display from the
MAPCL command.



OTHER INFORMATION

IBM also supplies a special REXX EXEC to manipulate the
CLISTs that have been pre-loaded into storage.  This EXEC is
called AUTODROP and allows you to drop any CLISTs that
have been pre-loaded if they have not met a certain usage count
over a given period of time.  This CLIST is stored as
CNMS8003 in the NetView-supplied CLIST library.

There are also several trivial APARs related to these commands
and CLISTs that you may want to review on Dial-IBM or
through your support centre, prior to utilizing these functions.
They are: OY28488, OY26687, OY25535, OY24815, and
OY24248 for LOADCL; and OY38900, OY31925, OY28484,
OY28510 for MAPCL.
