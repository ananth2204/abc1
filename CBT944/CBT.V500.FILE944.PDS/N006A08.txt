Bypassing NetView's timer restrictions


THE PROBLEM

We have developed several REXX EXECs to perform
maintenance tasks (for example reorganizing the session
monitor database) that run under NetView 2.1. Ideally we
would like to run this type of EXEC overnight at regular
intervals to perform routine maintenance.

The normal method of doing this is by using the AT, AFTER,
and EVERY timer commands with the PPT and SAVE options.

For example, to issue a command weekly at 01.00 am on a
specific morning can be achieved by issuing the following
timer command some time during the previous day:

      AT 01:00:00,PPT EVERY 0007 00:00:00,PPT,SAVE command

Unfortunately, if the command procedure contains certain
statements (eg &WAIT in a CLIST or TRAP/WAIT in a
REXX EXEC) it is unable to run under the primary program
operator interface task (PPT). This was the case with our
EXECs that use message trapping, so the following solution
was devised.


THE SOLUTION

A REXX EXEC called INVOKE was created, whose function
is solely to act as a vehicle for passing on the command to be
executed for processing by the Message Automation Table
(MAT). This EXEC could, in effect, do nothing, but in this
case it issues a message to the NETLOG.

INVOKE REXX EXEC

/************************************/
/*                                  */
/* INVOKE REXX exec                 */
/*                                  */
/************************************/
/* Initialize error handling.       */
/************************************/
Trace E
/************************************/
/* Get input variable (COMMAND).    */
/************************************/
Arg COMMAND
/************************************/
/* Issue message to NETLOG          */
/************************************/
'MSG LOG,COMMAND 'COMMAND' ISSUED'
Exit

Thus a command to be executed later would be entered as
follows:

      AT 01:00:00,PPT EVERY 007 00:00:00,PPT,SAVE INVOKE "command"

Note that double quotes are necessary around the command to
be issued.

The following entry was set up in the MAT:

      IF MSGID = 'DSI208I' & TEXT = .'INVOKE "'COMMAND'"'. THEN
         EXEC(CMD('ISSUE ' COMMAND) ROUTE(ONE AUTO1));

This will extract the command to be executed from the timer
expiration message (DSI208I) and pass it as an argument to a
second REXX EXEC called ISSUE. This is necessary as the
MAT will not allow a variable to be used as the command or
EXEC to be executed. This EXEC (ISSUE) will be routed to
the AUTO1 task for execution.

ISSUE REXX EXEC

A REXX EXEC called ISSUE, was created, whose function
was to issue the command passed to it as an argument by the
MAT.

/************************************/
/*                                  */
/* ISSUE REXX exec                  */
/*                                  */
/************************************/
/* Initialize error handling.       */
/************************************/
Trace E
/************************************/
/* Get input variable (COMMAND).    */
/************************************/
Arg COMMAND
/************************************/
/* Issue command.                   */
/************************************/
COMMAND
Exit

In order that saved timers are made available after NetView has
been closed and re-started, it is necessary to include the
RESTORE TIMER command in the NetView initialization
CLISTs (CNME1034 or CNME1035).
