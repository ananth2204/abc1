Correction to the June issue

There are a couple of minor corrections to the code in the
article Getting started with LU6.2, which appeared in the June
1991 issue of SNA Update.  In both applications the following
statement should follow the OPEN LU62ACB:

      SETLOGON RPL=LU62RPL,OPTCD=START

In addition, in application program 2 the code from the label
LU62ATTN should read:

LU62ATTN  DS    0H

          Entry protocol

          L     R6,16(,R1)
          USING ISTRPL6,R6
          L     R3,=A(LU62CID)
          MVC   0(4,R3),RPL6CNVD
          L     R4,=A(WAKECB)
          POST  (4)

          Exit protocol

We apologise for any inconvenience this may have caused.
