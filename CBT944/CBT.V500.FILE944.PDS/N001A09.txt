Displaying NCP pseudo-slowdown status flag

Often, an NCP might be performing poorly and a useful check,
especially on a 3725 where real storage is limited, is of
whether the NCP has hit pseudo-slowdown.  This occurs before
a real slowdown occurs and there is no warning when in
pseudo-slowdown.

The following NetMaster NCL procedure, which could easily
be adapted for NetView, checks all the active NCPs.  The first
byte should always be X'00' - anything greater than X'00'
indicates that the NCP is in pseudo-slowdown.  Basically the
XDB at offset X'6E0' offset X'4' indicates the pseudo-
slowdown status.  The code is applicable to 3725s and upwards
running NCP Version 4.2 and Net/Master.
