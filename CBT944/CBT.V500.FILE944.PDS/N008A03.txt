Retrieving the VTAM NETID

Recently, as part of our automated operations planning and
network control site distribution, we have had to provide a
mechanism for deciding which batch processes are to be run,
depending on the system in question.

Initially we were going to use the SYSID of the system;
however, in the past this has changed and also is different for
each machine even though the processing for some machines in
the same network is identical.

After a lot of thought we decided that we would use our
VTAM NETID to invoke the necessary automation. The
NETID is never changed and is unique to each of our networks
but the same for machines sited in the same network.

What we needed was a process that would retrieve the system's
NETID and then issue a message to the console. This is then
captured by NetView or Net/Master automation and, depending
on the NETID, the necessary job schedules are started.

I wrote the following very simple Assembler program to
achieve the NETID retrieval. It locates the VTAM ATCVT
control block and then obtains the address that points to the
eight-character NETID in storage. This is moved to a WTO
which is issued to the operator's console and retrieved by a
message automation rule. This then uses a small NetView
REXX EXEC to process and start the necessary schedules.

At present this is the only use we have put this to; however, we
plan to use the NETID to schedule network start-up and shut-
down automation and to automate some messages that are
issued to remote users.
