Welcome to SNA Update

Welcome to the first issue of SNA Update.  While it has taken
some time for the original idea of a technical journal that
addresses SNA to come to full fruition, we are confident that
SNA Update will take its place alongside CICS Update, VM
Update, and MVS Update as an indispensable part of the
library of any IBM mainframe installation.

Our principal aim is to provide a vehicle for the exchange of
hints, tips, warnings, and reports between systems
programmers, technical support staff, network administrators,
and any other personnel who require a detailed knowledge of
SNA-related facilities.

We have broadened our interpretation of SNA to include many
aspects of mainframe data communications and networking that
might not otherwise be covered by a more literal definition.
This isdone not to upset the purists but to give SNA Update a
wider appeal and to ensure that that the investment made by
our subscribers is repaid as fully and as quickly as possible.

The production of SNA Update relies heavily on the input of
our readers.  Unfortunately, a large potential source for many
articles remains untapped.  Some of the most valuable articles
concern things that have gone wrong.  We, and more
importantly your fellow readers, would like very much to hear
details of any of your SNA-related experiences where things
did not quite go according to plan.  While it might be a bit
embarrassing admitting that something was your mistake, we
can spare your blushes, if you wish, by preserving your
anonymity should we publish your work.  There are very few
errors you can make in the DP world that some other poor soul
would not repeat if he or she is not warned about them and
sharing a description of any of your bloomers is a very good
way of turning a negative event into something positive.

We pay a good competitive rate for material accepted for
publication ($250 or Â‚120 per 1000 words) or we can offer free
12-month subscriptions to any of our technical journals in
exchange for using your article.  If you would like further
details, please contact the editor, Steve Piggott, at any of the
addresses shown on page 2.
