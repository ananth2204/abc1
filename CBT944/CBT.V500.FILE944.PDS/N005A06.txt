Loading NCP through VM

I have read several articles that address problems in loading
and activating the NCP in VM/VSE environments. Our
configuration consists of VM/SP 1.5 (ACF/VTAM 3.1.1,
ACF/NCP 4.3.1, ACF/SSP 3.5.1, and RSCS 2.3.0) and
VSE/SP 4.1.1 (ACF/VTAM 3.2.1 and CICS 1,7). Most of our
remote users are CICS users with some remote printers shared
between CICS and RSCS. Because our 3725 has only one
channel adapter and we don't have NCP/SSP in VSE, we need
to generate and load the 3725 from VM/CMS and activate the
lines from VSE/VTAM. To do this we have the following
procedures.


NCP GENERATION

To generate NCP we use the following EXEC:

/* Provide proper access order for NCP generation */
'desbuf *'
'q v stor (fifo'
pull lixo lixo size
size = left(size,5)
if size < 4096 then
   do
     say 'At least 4MB machine is necessary to build NCP'
     say 'A new IPL is necessary (DEF STOR 4MB'
exit
end
'vmfclear'
'release b'
'release c'
'release d'
'release e'
'release f'
'release g'
'access 343 a'     /* run disk ssp */
'access 342 b/a'   /* zap disk ssp */
'access 341 c/a'   /* merge disk ssp */
'access 340 d/a'   /* delta disk ssp */
'access 33f e/a'   /* base disk ssp */
'access 355 f/a'   /* run disk ncp /*
'access 191 g'     /* maint 191 disk */
'vmfclear'
say 'New access order is:'
say
'QUERY DISK'
say
say
say 'To check NCP syntax enter: VMFAST FN=xxx FT=xxx FM=x'
SAY 'To build NCP enter: VMNCP FN=xxx FT=xxx FM=x V=V4R3.1 Model=3725'
exit


Alterations to VMNCP EXEC

In the VMNCP EXEC, the following line:

      'ERASE TABLE2 TEXT'

should be commented out, preventing the erasure of the file
TABLE2 TEXT at the end of the NCP generation. This file is
the RRT. It will be necessary to link-edit it in VSE to permit
line activation by VSE/VTAM. This text will be found in the
run disk of SSP (343) and should contain the following JCLto
be catalogued in the VSE library:

* $$ JOB JNM ...
// JOB CATRRT
// LIBDEF *,CATALOG=sublibrary.name
// EXEC LIBR
   ACC S=sublibrary.name
   CATALR xxxx (should be equal parm 'NEWNAME' in BUILD)
.... put here the table2 text ....
.... first card is 'esd' ....
.... last card is 'txt' followed by 'end' card
/*
// OPTION CATAL
// LIBDEF *,SEARCH=sublibrary.name
// LIBDEF *,CATALOG=sublibrary.name
 PHASE xxxxR,+0,NOAUTO  (xxx should equal NEWNAME
                       parm in BUILD and be followed by 'R')
 INCLUDE xxxx (equals 'NEWNAME parm in BUILD)
// EXEC LNKEDT,SIZE=128K
/*
/&
* $$ EOJ

After execution of the above job, erase or rename the file
TABLE2 TEXT, or you will get an error in your next NCP
generation. The error will occur in the NCP load (timestamp
mismatch).


B BOOK GENERATION IN VSE

To generate the B book in VSE use the file used in your NCP
generation and the following JCL.

* $$ JOB JNM ...
// JOB CATBOOK
// EXEC LIBR
ACC S=sublibrary.name
CATALOG xxx.B  REP=YES (xxx equal to 'NEWNAME' in BUILD)
... PCCU ..... (should be the first card)
    .
    etc
    .
    GENEND
    END
/+
/*
* $$ EOJ


How to utilize the NCP with VM and VSE

Alter the ATCCON member of VTAM/VM to perform an
automatic load of the NCP. At this time the 3725 should be
attached to your VM/VTAM machine. All lines in our case are
generated with the parameter 'ISTATUS=INACTIVE' in the
LINE macro. After the load is complete, deactivate the NCP in
VTAM/VM, wait for the message saying NCP is inactive to
detach the 3725 from VTAM/VM, and attach it to your VSE
machine. In the ATCCON member of your VSE machine, the
NCP should not appear. After the attach has been performed,
issue the following command at the VSE console:

      V NET,ID=xxxx,ACT,LOAD=NO,SCOPE=ALL

where xxxx is the NEWNAME. This command will activate
the NCP in VSE and all lines.


THINGS TO BEAR IN MIND

o      Always execute the complete process described above (ie
      the NCPGEN, the RRT, and the B book in VSE) because
      VTAM checks the timestamp for the RRT against the NCP
      and, if a mismatch occurs, NCP will not be activated in
      VM or VSE.

o      It will be necessary to define two PCCU macros (one for
      VM and another for VSE). The PCCU macro in VSE
      should have the parameter SYSLUB, which should reflect
      the SYSxxx used in the VTAM start-up to assign the 3725.

o      Two HOST macros should be defined too (one for VM and
      one for VSE).

o      To use RSCS with a remote printer shared with CICS, you
      should pay particular attention to the PATH macro. Figure
      1 shows a schematic representation of our network. The
      printer is defined in VTAM/VSE and used by RSCS using
      cross domain.

PATH macro definition in VTAM/VSE

PATH1112 DESTSA=12,ER0=(12,1),VR0=0
PATH1114 DESTSA=14,ER0=(14,1),VR0=0

PATH macro in the NCP

PATH1411 DESTSA=11,ER0=(11,1),VR0=0
PATH1412 DESTSA=12,ER0=(11,1),VR0=0,ER1=(12,1),
                   VR0=0,VR1=1

PATH macro definition in VTAM/VM

PATH1211 DESTSA=11,ER0=(11,1),VR0=0
PATH1214 DESTSA=14,ER0=(11,1),VR0=0,ER1=(14,1),
                   VR0=0,VR1=1
