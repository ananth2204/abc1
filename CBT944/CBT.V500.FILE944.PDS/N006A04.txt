LANs and SNA networks - a recent survey

SNA's inability to transport LAN protocols has forced many
users to run separate networks to connect remote LANs. This
point was one of several findings by Xephon's IBEX research
project, a continuous series of surveys of over 1000 IBM and
PCM mainframe installations all over the world.

Virtually all the mainframe sites surveyed had one or more
LANs. A third of all LANs were connected to other LANs at
the same location, while about one in five were connected
remotely to LANs at other locations.

Just over 60% of all the sites surveyed had an SNA WAN, with
larger sites up to twice as likely to have one as smaller sites.
The LAN architecture made virtually no difference (although
one would have imagined that sites opting for an SNA WAN
would also tend to opt for IBM's Token Ring).

Users were asked whether they used different networks for
SNA and LAN interconnection. Of those who reported remote
LAN interconnection, 39% used separate networks and 61%
used a single network. LAN interconnection across an SNA
network is not straightforward, as the recent phenomenal
demand for multi-protocol routers testifies, so we were a little
surprised to find quite so many organizations apparently
managing with a single SNA WAN.

Of those with separate networks, 33% blamed the inability to
transport LAN protocols across SNA, 18% the lack of ports on
37xxs, and 15% the lack of bandwidth on the SNA network. A
variety of other reasons were also given for having separate
networks, including cost, greater vendor choice, the need for
alternative paths, security, and historical accident.
