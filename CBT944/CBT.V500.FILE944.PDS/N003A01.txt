NetView session monitor enhancement

In September 1990 IBM announced several PTFs that can be
used to enhance the session monitor component of NetView.
The session monitor is the updated version of the old NLDM
product.  The component is a large resource user, especially of
CPU and DASD storage in large networks.  I decided that these
PTFs could benefit our installation if we installed them.  The
PTFs in question are UY59375, UY60871, UY90722,
UY90723, UY90724.

The PTFs provide the following functionality and benefits:

1      Improved VSAM file usage.  This includes compression of
      the key size from 54 bytes to 27; the reduction, by a
      variable amount, of the data segment of the record; and
      combining five individual monitor VSAM records into
      one, which IBM claims will reduce space requirements by
      at least 20%.  Combining these records also allows you to
      stop the collection of the AAULETIM records, providing
      even more space savings.  The PCID recorded in the data
      records has been reversed.  This provides optimum use of
      these records after a purge operation.

2      Messages AAU020I and AAU022I are issued by the
      session monitor when a dataset full condition occurs.  The
      PTFs provide you with the ability to suppress these
      messages, preventing a message overflow from occurring.

3      Sessions can now be filtered with the attribute of 'sense code'.

The PTFs can be installed using standard SMP/E job streams.
Once they are installed you should ensure that all the
instructions in the provided cover letters are performed.  The
enhancements create new NetView messages, so you should
regenerate the on-line message database using the following job
stream.

A documentation member named CNMREAD5 is placed in the
CNMSAMP dataset.  This member provides detailed
information about the PTFs.  It should be reviewed and copies
distributed to all members of staff concerned with NetView.
You will also have to redefine the session monitor datasets to
provide for the new record formats.  The PTF cover letters
guide you through this process.  IBM recommends an initial
reduction in size of 20% for these datasets.  After a trial period
I have managed to reduce them by 50%, which has provided us
with a massive DASD space saving.  The reduction in size will
depend on many factors, and can often be unique to your
installation.

A new operator command called SMDR is provided.  This
command can be used to display session monitor data recording
status, suspend recording, and restart recording.  The command
can be used in automation processes or by the operator at the
NetView console.  Once the PTFs are installed, on-line help
about the command is available by typing in HELP SMDR at
the NetView console.

The PTFs also provide a new facility known as Sense Code
Filtering (SCF).  This new facility allows sessions to be
filtered, depending on sense code.  A special program referred
to as the SCF can be used to analyze your session monitor
datasets.  The information produced can be used to identify the
frequency of sense codes.  From this information decisions can
be made on which sense codes should be filtered.  To analyse
the session monitor datasets you should use the following job
stream.

This job stream is provided as member CNMSJM10 in the
CNMSAMP dataset.  The job can be executed while NetView
is active or inactive.  A report is generated similar to the one
shown in Figure 1.  The report contains up to 200 entries and
contains frequency counts for sense codes (totals column) and
the percentage.  If more than 200 entries exist, the last entry
will contain counts for all sense codes that are not displayed on
the report.

After reviewing the report you may decide that you would like
to filter certain sense codes.  This requires a modification to
member CNMS0055 in the CNMSAMP dataset.  Full details
on how to perform this modification are contained in
CNMREAD5.  To invoke this type of filtering, NetView has to
be restarted.

In conclusion, these enhancements can be beneficial in
improving the session monitor portion of the NetView product.
The main savings at our installation have been a reduction in
DASD space and automation of session monitor operation
using the SMDR command.
