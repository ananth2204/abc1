)F REXX function - Test a string against a pattern

Build: 003

 Fixes in this build
 - Possible false negative when mask and string has same langth.

 Changes in this build
 - 4th parameter change to T for trace, better info for tracing.


Syntax

 rc = RxPattrn(string,pattern,wildcard)

 Parameters
  string    just a string
  pattern   the pattern to test against, or preprocess
  wildcard  2 chars for zero-or-none and one-char test.
            Optional, default is '*%'.

 Return
   0   ok
   1   pattern not match
   2   missing string
   3   missing pattern
   4   invalid wildcard length

   if rc gt 1 then variable RXPATTRN_RS contains a reason text.

Installation notes

  The program will  by default reload itself thus  retaining the module
 in   the  JPAQ.   This   improves  performance   for  multiple   calls
 significantly. This load  will not be done if the  program is added to
 the LPA, which is the recommended placement.
  You  can disable  the  self-load option  by  removing the  'CDEUCTZ2'
 statement.

 Small test of RXPATTRN in a REXX pgm, scan 36 records 100 times.

                        EXCP   CONN    TCB
  CDEUCTZ2 disabled     7284      0   1.35
  CDEUCTZ2 enabled        90      0    .09
  Running from LPA        51      0    .14

 Admittedly  I haven't  tried to  mimic  the pattern  check using  REXX
 statements. It  probably would not  increase the EXCP values,  but the
 cpu- and elaps times might very well go throuh the roof.
