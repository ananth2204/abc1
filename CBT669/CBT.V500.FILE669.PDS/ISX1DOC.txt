ISPF exit 1 - make dynamic panels from REXX stem(s)

 Current build: 002

 This ISPF panel exit is used to insert records into an ISPF panel
 from one or more REXX stems.
 It can replace the entire panel, or parts of the panel, with data
 from the stem(s).

 The exit looks for a line starting with '*ISPDPX01 vname' in the
 panel, then inserts the entire stem vname there.
 The vname must include the trailing dot, max width incl the dot
 is 5 characters.

 Multiple occurences of '*ISPDPX01 vname' is allowed.

 The length of the variable is internally reduced to the panel buffer
 size, which is the record length of the panel library.

 Sample panel, named TESTX001:

  )INEXIT LOAD,ISPDPX01
  *ISPDPX01 pl.
  )END

 Note that the )END statement must still be present in the panel.

 Sample REXX code for using the above panel:

  pl.1 = ')ATTR'
  pl.2 = ')BODY expand(\\)'
  pl.3 = '%Test panel exit 1'
  pl.4 = '%Cmd =>_zcmd  \ \ +'
  pl.5 = '+'
  pl.6 = 'Just some text'
  pl.7 = '+'
  pl.8 = ')INIT'
  pl.9 = ')PROC'
  pl.0 = 9
  address ispexec "display panel(TESTX001)"

 The program is written using my structured assembly macro set WSAM.
 These macros are similar but not identical to IBM's structured
 assembly macros.

 Members in the dataset:
  ISPDPX01  Source - assemble and link.
  ISX1DOC   Documentation (you are reading it now).
  ISX1MACS  Macro copy book.
  ISX1IVP1  Verification pgm.
  ISX1PNL*  Sample panels etc.

Installation notes:
If the assmebly fails for enhanced immediate instruction, i.e. LGFI,
then remove the asterix in front of 'COPY  Z10MACS' and reassemble.
