Hi Sam,

I have made a replacement for CBT file 669. As recently
mentioned, I have updated the STRPATRN subroutine, so programs
using that use that must of course also be updated.

The CBT 669 replacement is in the Dallas system as dataset
WJENSEN.CBT669.LIB. Please note that it is a total replacement,
do not use anything from the old dataset.

Best regards
Willy
