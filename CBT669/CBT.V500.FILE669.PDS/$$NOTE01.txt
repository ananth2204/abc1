Hello Sam,
I have a new CBT file 669 build ready.

Note that it is a complete replacement of the earlier build. You
might want to change the $$$#DATE member, all else should be
ready to roll out.

Highlights
REXXGBLV - major virtual storage constraint relief, new operand
           DATA(mask) to filter on data contents.
RXVSAMBA - support for ESDS.
RXPATTRN - new, test a string by a mask.
RXWAIT - new, can wait for whole seconds or fractions of a second.

Best regards
Willy
