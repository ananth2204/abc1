019   the first real production ready version
020   change VCB to double-linked list as a prep for later performance
      enhancement.
      move logically deleted VCBs to a separate (single-linked) list (perf).
021   add the EXPORT/IMPORT commands
022   beautifying
023   add 'SHORT' operand to VLIST.
024   add 'ADD VAR(name) function.
025   fix problem with the PARMSCAN subroutine when value is 1 byte.
      fix variable handling problem with the ADD subroutine.
027   add new VCBs in sorted order, so the locate function can stop when
      reaching a lower collating seq (perf).
028   LISTVAR, VERSION and REXXVPUT added.
029   INDEX function added. Major rewrite as I am starting to use the
      structured macros.
030   Maintenance.
031   Variable length set default to 250 after a request from ibm-main.
032   Fixed bug in the import function - it didn't add data to the
      internal data store.
033 - Allow poolname gt 8 bytes, max 16.
      Note that the poolname becomes part of the name of a name/token pair.
      If the poolname length is less than or equal to 8 then the name
      is internally prefixed with '$REXXGB' which should make it unique.
      If a poolname wider than 8 bytes is supplied, then the user must
      ensure uniqueness!!
    - Show 'Listing' and the poolname in the output from the LIST
      function.
034 - Fix problem where "export" function truncates values.
      Thanks to Johann SagmÃ¼ller from s-itsolutions for finding the problem
      and suggesting a fix.
035 - RC=4 if no variables loaded.
      RC=8 if type READ and pool not found.
036 - RLIST is not a pool read function, so a pool must not exist
      and by the way, RLIST is now documented.
037 - RINDEX changed so that the value of the generated stem is the source
      stem suffix, not the entire stem name. I.e if the original stem name
      is cities.sydney, then only 'sydney' is stored in the numbered stem.
038 - Fix problem with save of variables with length shorter than stored.
      Before this fix the data length was not updated.
      New parm DD(ddname) to EXPORT and IMPORT.
      if VAR(var) specifies a stem then generic processing is used.
      Fix loop with VLOAD and an empty pool
039 - New functions CLRSAVE and CLRVSAVE.
      New functions SAVEEXP and IMPLOAD.
040 - use PARMSCN2 for parameter extraction
041 - return value: vv=REXXGBLV('return var(name)')
042 - use external copybook REXXMACS for REXX interface macros
      Trace ddname now RXGVLOG
043 - Internal data length limit removed.
      Problems with generic retrieval fixed.
044 - export/import data length limit removed.
      return error message in REXXGBLV_MSG instead of SAYing it.
045 - externalizing values
        REXXGBLV_MAXNL   max name length
        REXXGBLV_MAXDL   max data length
        REXXGBLV_MAXNDL  max name+data length
      STEMIX call should now be: STEMIX STEM(stemname.)
046 - fix storage overlay
      new externalized values
        REXXGBLV_RLISTN  number of entries listed for RLIST
        REXXGBLV_VLISTN  number of entries listed for LIST
047 - minor internal fixes
        RxStemNm -> RxStemName
048 - add the COPY command.
049 - add the VARIX command.
    - change: RETURN will return a null value if pool or variable do not exist.
050 - add the LOADDROP command.
      externalizing values
        REXXGBLV_VSAVEN  number of entries saved
051 - fix creeping storage, 32K was not freed at end
052 - program is now fully reentrant, so can reside in LPALIB
053 - LOGGER subroutine uses REXX SAY instead of write to RXGVLOG DD.
      VEXP and VIMP have been changed so that the entire program can
      reside in 31-bit storage.
054 - Changes in this build
        The RINDEX command is dropped, use VARIX instead.
      Fixed in this build
        INDEX STEM operand not handled correctly.
        Tracing now works for all components

055 - add command PULL - load vars and delete from store.
056 - add operand VALVAR - name of variable containing value, used with
      function ADD

057 - add operand LISTSTEM for LIST and RLIST commands
      change internals re the STRMAKE and STRCOPY macros etc.
      fix potential abend S0C4 when building trace records

058 - Major internal rewrite.
    - Some functions like IMPLOAD now uses an temporary pool, so you do
      not have to delete a named pool before and after.
    - Command CLRVSAVE renamed to DELSAVE, CLRVSAVE kept as alias.
    - Command CLRSAVE renamed to DROPSAVE, CLRSAVE kept as alias.
    - New command REXPORT exports REXX variables directly to the file.
    - New command RIMPORT imports  REXX variables directly from export
      file.
    - New command MAP for debugging.

059 - Performance enhancement, keep module in JPAQ
    - Documentation changes

060 - Fix abend S40A in RLIST when no REXX variables exist.
    - Virtual storage constraint relief, minimize risk of abend S878.
    - Internal change, use own pattern match routine instead of ASAXWC.
    - New command RLIST - return count and total data size of selected
      variable(s).
    - New operand DATA(mask) to filter on data contents.

061 - Handle abends in IMPORT open, i.e. when empty dataset.

062 - 31-bit I/O buffers, linked as rmode any
063 - Set rc=4 if no records are returned.
    - Set rc=4 for some founctions if pool is not found.
    - Set rc=4 if SAVE could not retrieve variables to store.
    This is customizable, see new customization member RXGVCUST.
064 - Fix STEMIX function function.
