//***FILE 876 is from Tom Armstrong, and contains the ALGOL F       *   FILE 876
//*           Version 2.1 compiler.  This is a complete reworking   *   FILE 876
//*           of the ALGOL F version 2 compiler from IBM, for       *   FILE 876
//*           which the materials are contained in CBT Overflow     *   FILE 876
//*           tape, File 089, and CBT Tape files 309 and 310.       *   FILE 876
