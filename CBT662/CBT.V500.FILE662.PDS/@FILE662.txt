//*     This file contains code used to provide an automated        *   FILE 662
//*     bridge between the CA-1 tape management system and the      *   FILE 662
//*     FakeTape(tm) facility of FLEX-ES.  This contribution        *   FILE 662
//*     will require a lot of tailoring to your environment.        *   FILE 662
//*                                                                 *   FILE 662
//*     It is based upon the TSSO Automated Operator Facility       *   FILE 662
//*     (AOF), for which see File 404 of the CBT tape.  It uses     *   FILE 662
//*     a network connection between the MVS system and Unixware    *   FILE 662
//*     (or Linux) to issue remote commands which create the        *   FILE 662
//*     FakeTape(tm) file and MOUNT it on the desired unit          *   FILE 662
//*     address. This may require a network bridge to route         *   FILE 662
//*     traffic between the networks and may need TCP/IP routing    *   FILE 662
//*     changes in MVS and in Unixware (or Linux).  The members     *   FILE 662

//*                 have to be specified as Assembler variables     *   FILE 662
//*                 at the start of the program. You will need      *   FILE 662
//*                 macros from File 172 of the CBT tape and        *   FILE 662
//*                 from CA-1 to be able to assemble this           *   FILE 662
//*                 program. This program invokes the program       *   FILE 662

//*                 tapes defined for FakeTape(tm) use and if so    *   FILE 662
//*                 it invokes FSF to find a SCRATCH tape. Then     *   FILE 662
//*                 it issues a REXEC to the Unixware (or Linux)    *   FILE 662

//*                 password to create a file with a VOL1 label     *   FILE 662

//*                 into a FakeTape(tm) file in the appropriate     *   FILE 662
//*                 directory, which is then MOUNTed by FLEX-ES     *   FILE 662

//*     AGCO UK Ltd. replaced an IBM Multiprise 2003 mainframe      *   FILE 662
//*     running OS390 R2.10 in February 2004 with an IBM            *   FILE 662
//*     X-series server running FLEX-ES under SCO Unixware. The     *   FILE 662
//*     same OS390 R2.10 system was copied across. We run a         *   FILE 662
//*     mixed workload with a few TSO Users, about 60 IMS Users     *   FILE 662
//*     and overnight batch. We have a worldwide network which      *   FILE 662
//*     was SNA but is now mostly IP.  We have successfully         *   FILE 662
//*     tested Enterprise Extender over the FLEX-ES emulated OSA    *   FILE 662
//*     card.  We ordered a three channel adaptor card supplied     *   FILE 662
//*     by Fundamental Software Inc., the vendors of FLEX-ES to     *   FILE 662
//*     drive a 3745, local printers and tapes.                     *   FILE 662
//*                                                                 *   FILE 662
//*     We installed four daisy chained SCSI tape decks as well     *   FILE 662
//*     as having eight IBM 3490-E drives connected via one         *   FILE 662
//*     channel of the PCA.  As may be expected tape performance    *   FILE 662
//*     is poor, but it has always been our intention to replace    *   FILE 662
//*     tapes with FakeTape(tm) anyway. To that end we defined      *   FILE 662
//*     in the IODF a string of 3480 tape drives for use with       *   FILE 662
//*     this facility.  We also defined an additional EDT with      *   FILE 662
//*     the MIS standard name CART pointing to these drives.        *   FILE 662
//*     Thus we can switch FakeTape(tm) on and off by activating    *   FILE 662
//*     the appropriate EDT, either at IPL or by a dynamic          *   FILE 662
//*     software-only change using HCD. Because they have           *   FILE 662
//*     different device types in their catalog entries there is    *   FILE 662
//*     no confusion of fake or real tapes. To be sure we use a     *   FILE 662
//*     separate range of tape numbers in the TMC for               *   FILE 662
//*     FakeTape(tm).                                               *   FILE 662
