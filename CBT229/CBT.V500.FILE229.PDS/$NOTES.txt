             Notes for running the COPYMODS program

Introduction.

      The COPYMODS program was written by Paul Tokheim in the late
1970s, for the purpose of making bulk duplicates of NL mods tapes,
to be distributed to installations.  NL was chosen for these tapes,
because there was no guarantee that an installation's security system
wouldn't block the acquisition of the tape's data.  Security systems
for tapes were more SL-oriented.  Using NL tapes for distributing
free software, there was simply less of a problem than with SL tapes.

      COPYMODS works with an input DDname of IN, for the input tape
(the tape to be copied), and output DDnames of OUT1 thru OUT16.  You
can use any of these output DDnames, and you can make up to 16
duplicates in one run, from one input tape.

      COPYMODS will also copy SL tapes, labels and all, treating the
labels as files.  Therefore you have to have BLP privilege and code
BLP in the JCL.  However, COPYMODS does not have to run authorized,
because it is not resetting BLP in the JFCB and running OPEN TYPE=J,
the way COPYFILE (from CBT Tape File 316 and 229) does.

      See the COPYMODS source for more detail.


Mechanisms and Features.

      COPYMODS works as follows:  After doing a TIOT scan to determine
which OUT1 thru OUT16 DDnames are there, COPYMODS opens the appropriate
output tapes, and the input tape.  The input tape is read, and the
data, one block at a time, is copied into a buffer at the end of the
program itself.  From there, the data is copied to each open output
tape, one EXCP at a time.  Then another block is read in.  A tape mark
in, causes a tape mark to be written out to all of the output tapes.
In the first implementation of this program, the program stopped
unconditionally after 2 tape marks were read in from the input tape.

      The following features were added to COPYMODS by Sam Golob.
Most of these features have to do with teaching COPYMODS about IBM
standard tape labels:

     1.  COPYMODS WILL NOW NOT STOP COPYING WHEN AN SL
         TAPE CONTAINING A NULL FILE WOULD BE READ IN.
         THIS FILE CONTAINS 2 TAPE MARKS IN A ROW,
         BUT IT DOES NOT INDICATE THE END OF THE TAPE.

     2.  64K BLOCK SIZES ON A TAPE CAN BE COPIED.  THE
         LIMIT USED TO BE 32K BLOCK SIZE.

     3.  UP TO 16 OUTPUT DDNAMES ALLOWED INSTEAD OF 10.

     4.  INITTED TAPES, AND SL MULTIVOLUME TAPES CAN
         BE CORRECTLY COPIED (ONE INPUT TAPE AT A TIME).

     5.  ALL STANDARD LABEL INFORMATION, OR ANY
         PARTICULAR LABEL TYPES, CAN BE PRINTED, IF
         FOUND ON THE INPUT TAPE.

     6.  A FLEXIBLE TABLE-DRIVEN PARM KEYWORD SCANNER
         WAS ADDED.  THIS ALLOWS FOR EASY SETTING OF
         PROGRAM DEFAULTS, AND KEYWORD SYNONYMS.  SEE
         LABEL PARMTABL.

     7.  OPTIONALLY, THE VOLSER OF THE OUTPUT TAPES
         CAN BE SET TO THE JCL VOLSER, INSTEAD OF THE
         INPUT TAPE'S VOLSER.

     8.  TAPES WITH LEADING TAPE MARKS CAN BE COPIED
         EITHER AS-IS, OR WITH THE LEADING TAPE MARKS
         LEFT OFF.

     9.  EOV LABELS IN THE MIDDLE OF A TAPE, CAN NOW BE
         CHANGED TO EOF LABELS.  THIS CAN OCCUR IF THE
         TAPE WAS CREATED AS A COMPOSITE, BY THE COPYFILE
         PROGRAM.  THE APPROPRIATE EXEC PARM IS EOV2EOF
         (SEE LABEL PARMTABL FOR ALL ACCURATE AND CURRENT
         PARM KEYWORD SETTINGS).

    10.  COPYMODS CAN NOW BE RUN READ-ONLY FOR THE INPUT
         TAPE, USING PARMS OF READ, READONLY, OR NOWRITE.

    11.  COPYMODS CAN READ A TAPE (EITHER WHILE COPYING
         IT, OR IN READ-ONLY MODE), AND DUMP ALL THE TAPE
         LABELS TO AN FB-80 OUTPUT FILE WITH A DDNAME OF
         LABLDUMP.  USE A PARM OF LABLDUMP TO INVOKE THIS
         SERVICE.

    12.  WHEN COPYMODS DUMPS THE LABELS FROM AN SL TAPE
         USING THE LABLDUMP PARM, THESE LABEL IMAGES HAVE
         EXTRA CONTROL CARDS ADDED.  THESE LABELS CAN BE
         MERGED WITH THE FILES IN AN NL VERSION OF THE
         SAME TAPE, AND A NEW SL TAPE CREATED.  BY DEFAULT,
         BLOCK COUNTS IN THE EOF1 AND EOV1 OF THE OUTPUT
         TAPE ARE CORRECTED TO SHOW THE ACTUAL BLOCK
         COUNTS ON THE TAPE, BUT THIS CORRECTION CAN BE
         MANUALLY TURNED OFF WITH A PARM SETTING.

         IF YOU CODE A PARM OF SYSIN IN THE PARM FIELD
         OF THE EXEC CARD, THEN COPYMODS NOW TAKES PARM
         INPUT FROM SYSIN, AND THOSE SYSIN PARMS CAN
         OVERRIDE THE OTHER PARMS FROM THE EXEC CARD,
         BECAUSE SYSIN IS SEARCHED LATER.

         OUTVOLALL=VOLSER , STARTING IN COLUMN1 OF A SYSIN
         CARD, WILL CAUSE ALL OUTPUT VOL1 LABELS TO BE
         OVERWRITTEN WITH THE CODED VOLSER.  THE REST OF
         THAT CARD IS NOT SEARCHED FOR PARMS.

    13.  There are more features, including FILELIMIT=nnn
         in column 1 of a SYSIN card, that will be interpreted
         either as SL or NL, depending on whether the input
         tape is SL or NL.  There are also byte counts, which
         are obtainable with the BYTES or CUMTOT keywords.
         CUMTOT, in addition to giving byte counts for each
         file, will give a running total of byte counts for
         the entire tape.


      Item 12 lets you treat tape labels as files, and to create
copied tapes whose tape labels do not have to reflect an actual
jobname, an actual date, or an actual file name from the creating
system.  You can edit the set of labels using an editor, strip the
labels off the original tape using the COPYSLNL program or the STRIP
option of COPYMODS, and merge the newly edited set of labels using
the LABADDIN option of COPYMODS, into the NL tape, to create new
copies of the original tape, with any of the field names changed in
the labels.  And you can make up to 16 copies of these tapes at a
time.

      There's lots of flexibility in COPYMODS, if you look at the
implications in all of the options.  All EXEC parms (which now work
in SYSIN too) of COPYMODS are found at label PARMTABL.  This table
is the heart of a flexible parm scanner, which is in csect PARMCHEK.
The only other settings in COPYMODS, are in the SYSIN scan for keyword
parms, at label CARDREAD in the PARMCHEK csect.

      The parm scanner in COPYMODS allows for the setting of default
options, using any of the keywords in PARMTABL.  This is done using
the X'10' bit of the second byte of each PARMTABL entry.  Defaults
are scanned for, and set, first.  Then the EXEC parms are scanned.
Finally, if SYSIN is coded in the EXEC parm, then SYSIN is scanned
for either keywords, or PARMTABL settings.  Parms that have been
found last, are the ones that override.  Therefore, EXEC parms
override defaults, and SYSIN parms override EXEC parms.  Additionally,
valid words occurring later in the EXEC parms, override those occurring
earlier.  The same applies to parms coded in SYSIN.  The rule is:
later overrides earlier.  The parm scanner does not need commas or
other separators, but for clarity, it is good to code them.  One way
to be consistent, is to code SYSIN only in the EXEC PARM field, and
to code all the other parms in SYSIN cards.

      If you copy tapes a lot, you'll enjoy the many options in the
COPYMODS program.  Additionally, you can use COPYFILE (from File 229),
COPYSLNL, and COPYNLNL (also from File 229), to achieve whatever
tape copying results you want.  If you can't do some job in tape
copying that you want to do, please contact me, and I'll see if
we can add a feature.  Thanks in advance.
