        COPYMODS Program  -  Explanation of PARM Keywords     Level 36


Note:  As of Level 062 of COPYMODS, 10 parm bytes are set instead
       of 5, which had been increased from 3 as of Level 039.
       Otherwise, the action of the PARMTABL remains essentially
       unchanged, and it is as described below.

       In both the COPYMODS and PARMCHEK programs, the parm bytes
       are named:

       PARMFLGS DS    0CL10    10 CONTIGUOUS BYTES OF PARM FLAGS
       PARMFLG1 DC    X'00'     (used to be 3, then 5 bytes)
       PARMFLG2 DC    X'00'
       PARMFLG3 DC    X'00'
       PARMFLG4 DC    X'00'
       PARMFLG5 DC    X'00'
       PARMFLG6 DC    X'00'
       PARMFLG7 DC    X'00'
       PARMFLG8 DC    X'00'
       PARMFLG9 DC    X'00'
       PARMFLGA DC    X'00'

See member @PARMTBL in the COPYMODS.MANUAL produced from
the #MANUAL member of this pds, for the fairly current
parm table code.

Example of use of parm settings in the COPYMODS program:

        TM    PARMFLG3,X'02'     LIMIT FILES TO BE COPIED?
        BO    OPENINCK           DO PRELIMINARY OPEN IF SO

Note:  It is very easy to change PARM keywords in the COPYMODS program
       because of its table-driven PARM parser at label PARMCHEK.  See
       label PARMTABL for all permissible parms, and what switches they
       set.  PARMTABL parms are illustrated below.

Note:  This document may become obsolete, depending upon new enhancement
       features that may be put in after this document was written.
       The Level number at the upper right corner of this document
       reflects the COPYMODS program level at which this document
       claims some accuracy.

Note:  The PARMCHK subroutine of COPYMODS now sets five bytes of
       option bits, instead of three.  Therefore 40 option bits can
       now be set.  (Level 49)

        In addition, OUTVOLALL=VOLSER on a SYSIN card will cause all
        output tapes which are SL, to get a volser mentioned in this
        card.  COPYMODS replaces all the volume ids in the VOL1 card
        to equal this value.

        In addition, TAPEOWNER=owner info (10 characters) on a SYSIN
        card will alter the owner information on the VOL1 labels of
        the output tapes.
