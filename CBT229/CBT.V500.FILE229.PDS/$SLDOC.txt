Notes on the LABADDIN parm in the COPYMODS program.


   You can now create output tapes with your own customized
   standard labels.  These labels do not have to reflect the
   creating job, or anything else on your system.  You edit
   the labels using an editor, and you can merge them into
   the corresponding files of (up to 16) output tapes.

   It would be highly preferable that the edited labels conform
   to IBM standards.  If you want to create a set of labels
   which correspond to the data on your tape, create an SL
   tape with your data files, and use the LABLDUMP option of
   COPYMODS to create a set of labels, which can be used to
   input to the LABADDIN option of COPYMODS.

   To strip the labels off an SL tape while copying it, and
   to save off the tape labels into a separate dataset at the
   same time, run COPYMODS with both the STRIP and the
   LABLDUMP options.  Be sure to provide an FB-80 format
   dataset in the //LABLDUMP DD card, to receive the contents
   of the tape label sets.

   Alternatively:

   To strip the labels off an SL tape while copying it, use
   the COPYSLNL program with control cards of:

      1/1  ALL

   Help for the COPYSLNL program is in member COPYSLN#.

   The LABADDIN parm of COPYMODS performs the exact opposite
   function of COPYMODS with the STRIP and LABLDUMP options
   together.  If you point the //IN DD card of COPYMODS to the
   NL (stripped) tape, and you point the //LABADDIN DD card to
   the file produced by the LABLDUMP operation performed previously,
   then COPYMODS with the LABADDIN option will "sandwich" the
   label files from the LABADDIN dataset around the data files of
   the NL input tape, to produce an SL output tape, identical to
   the original SL tape that started the operations.

   While using the LABADDIN option of COPYMODS, the program reads
   the first record of the input tape, and then rewinds it.  If
   the first 4 characters of this record are VOL1, then the LABADDIN
   option will not open the output tape(s), so they are protected
   from being overwritten, if accidentally an SL tape is mounted
   as input to LABADDIN.

   In other words, you can't add more standard labels to an SL tape.

   LABADDIN will stop at end of input to the LABADDIN ddname file.
   Therefore, if the input tape contains 100 NL files, but the
   LABADDIN input ddname only contains 60 label images, then
   the output tape will only contain 60 output files.

   Conversely, if the input tape contains 30 NL files, and LABADDIN
   input contains 60 sets of file labels, LABADDIN will create 30
   empty SL files at the end of the tape.

   This all works out right, because you want to have a tape that
   is completely SL, and not "mixed".  LABADDIN is driven by the
   file of labels to be added.

   The control cards are very important.  Cards of the type:

   ----ENDOFLABELHEADER      and

   ----ENDOFLABELTRAILER

   generate tape marks in the output tape.  Cards beginning with an
   asterisk (* in column 1) are treated as comments and ignored.
   These cards also cause a switch in input from the label file
   to the NL tape, for the next output file to be written.

   ----ENDOFLABELTRAILEREOV should follow an EOV2 label.  It causes

   only one tape mark to be written at the end of the output tape,
   instead of the usual two tape marks.

   I would strongly suggest using the TAPESCAN program (CBT Tape
   File 102) plus the TAPEMAP program (File 299) for checking the
   integrity of your output tapes, before using them regularly on
   an MVS or OS/390 system.

   This is a legitimate technique for a "system doctor" if you need
   it.  Please use it wisely and responsibly.  Thanks in advance.
