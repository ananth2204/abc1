The currently shipped latest version of COPYMODS is Level 084 .

  Level 050 contains the STRIP option (to strip the labels from an
  SL input tape, and create NL output tapes).  This code now is
  operational.  If FILELIMIT=nnn is coded in a SYSIN card, then
  the nnn number is a limiting number for the number of files
  stripped.  (3 x nnn) files are read in from the SL input tape, and
  nnn data files are written to the NL output tapes.

  Level 068 introduced some ASCII tape support, and Level 069
  introduces some more.  But Level 069 had to be distributed with
  only partial ASCII support, because the OUTVOLALL=volser SYSIN
  keyword wasn't working properly for OUT2 thru OUT16, and the bug
  had to be fixed in Level 069.

  Bug fixed in Level 070, that if the input buffer containing a
  label had been altered by the LABELCHK program, the altered buffer
  now gets copied back into INAREA in the COPYMODS program.  Therefore
  EOV2EOF will now work properly, as will BLKCNT, etc.

  As of Level 072, full support for ASCII (ANSI/ISO Levels 3 and 4)
  tapes should be in place (please test as many functions as you can).

  In the event you are copying tapes that have the security indicators
  on (byte 54 of XXX1 label not equal C'0'), then the SECOFF keyword
  causes these to be reset to C'0' in the copied tapes, so read/write
  of the copied tapes will not require passwords.  Also done for ASCII
  tapes, where byte 11 of the VOL1 label also has to be adjusted.  The
  non-password value for ASCII tapes in these fields is X'20'.  (As of
  Level 075)

  Bug fixed in Level 082.  With STRIP in effect and if a data file on
  a tape contained a block with the exact size of 80, then no tape mark
  would be written after that file on the output tapes.  Fixed by test
  for data blocksize of 80, with the ISLBLFLG being X'00' indicating
  that this record is not a label.

  Please see File 847, which contains all the intermediate levels of
  COPYMODS that I have.  All levels from 050 thru 081 had the bug.
  So in File 847, I fixed the bug at all levels from 050 thru 081
  retroactively.  This fix made Levels 054 and 055 not assemblable.
  But the constraint (base registers being full) was fixed in Level
  056, and all other levels of COPYMODS found there, can be assembled
  and used.  Of course, the latest level is the one recommended.
