Notice --

  Due to the difficulty of testing a new version of COPYMODS with
  all its many options (in combination), I am including the previous
  version of COPYMODS (Level 056 as member COPYMO56) as a fallback.

  Level 083 is the currently distributed version of COPYMODS.

  Recent changes:

  LEVEL 053 - OPTION TO TURN OFF 3490E OR IDRC INDICATORS
              IN THE TAPE LABELS.  ALSO ON INPUT ERROR,
              CLOSE ALL THE FILES BEFORE ABEND 069.

  LEVEL 054 - HEX PRINT FIRST 132 BYTES OF FIRST N
              RECORDS OF EACH FILE.  IF KEYWORD HEXPRT
              IS CODED, A DEFAULT OF 4 BLOCKS FROM EACH
              TAPE FILE WILL BE DUMPED (THE WAY TAPESCAN
              DOES IT).  YOU CAN OVERRIDE THIS VALUE BY
              CODING PRINTRCDS=nnn IN SYSIN, STARTING IN
              COLUMN 1.  RECORDS ARE DUMPED INTO THE
              SYSPRINT DATASET.

  LEVEL 055 - MAKE DEFAULT NUMBER OF RECORDS TO HEX PRINT,
              A GLOBAL ASSEMBLER VARIABLE, &HEXDFLA.
              DISTRIBUTION VALUE IS SET TO 4, AS ABOVE.

  LEVEL 056 - TAKE THE TRANSLATE TABLES FOR HEX PRINT OUT
              OF THE MAIN CSECT.

  LEVEL 057 - USE THE PARMCHEK SEPARATED PARMSCAN ROUTINE
              INSTEAD OF THE PARMCHK SUBROUTINE FOR
              SCANNING PARM AND SYSIN CARDS.  THIS ALSO
              ALLOWS THE USE OF THE OPTIONAL DDNAME OF
              //PARMREPT TO LOOK AT THE ACTION OF THE
              PARM SCAN IN DETAIL.

  LEVEL 058 - UPON ERROR WITH ONE OF THE OUTPUT TAPES,
              REPORT NUMBER OF FILES CORRECTLY COPIED,
              NUMBER OF BLOCKS COPIED FROM LAST FILE,
              AND TOTAL BYTE COUNT COPIED TO THAT OUTPUT
              TAPE.  THIS IS A REMEDY FOR SHORT OUTPUT
              TAPES--TO FIGURE OUT HOW SHORT....

  LEVEL 059 - DOCUMENTATION CHANGES TO MAKE ALL THE
              FEATURE DESCRIPTIONS AS CONSISTENT AS
              POSSIBLE.

              FIX OUTPUT ERROR MESSAGES TO REFLECT PROPER
              UNIT ADDRESS AND VOLSER OF THE OUTPUT UNIT
              IN ERROR.

  LEVEL 060 - NEW PARM UNEXWTO, AND NOUNEXWT (TO TURN IT
              OFF).  THIS WILL SEND A WTOR TO THE OPERATOR
              WHEN ONE OF THE TAPES IS TOO SHORT.  (NOW
              IT IS THE DEFAULT, AS IN THE OLD DAYS.)

  LEVEL 061 - FIX BUG. IF SYSIN IS PRESENT BUT NOT CODED
              EXPLICITLY IN THE PARMS, THE OPTION WAS
              MARKED AS NOSYSIN IN THE OPTIONS DISPLAY.

              FIX BUG. AFTER LEVEL 057, PARMCHEK WAS NOT
              CALLED PROPERLY, AND THE ORIGINAL COPYMODS
              PARMS WERE LOST.  PRESERVE ORIGINAL PARMS
              IN PARMSTRT FIELD WHICH IS ACCESSIBLE TO
              R2, WHEN IT IS PASSED TO THE PARMCHEK
              PROGRAM.

              UPDATE PROGRAM DOCUMENTATION TO REFLECT THE
              CHANGES IN PROGRAM STRUCTURE AND DESIGN.

  LEVEL 062 - FIX DOC A BIT MORE.
              10 PARM BITS INSTEAD OF 5, in COPYMODS and PARMCHEK.
              CHANGES TO COPYMODS, COPYMOPT, PARMCHEK.

  LEVEL 063 - RC = 16 IF AT LEAST ONE SHORT OUTPUT TAPE
              WAS ENCOUNTERED, AND THE WTOR WAS ISSUED.
              RC = 8 IF ONE ERROR IN THE OUTPUT TAPES
              OCCURRED, WITHOUT ISSUING A WTOR.

  LEVEL 064 - Return Code adjustments.                                  01057
                                                                        01058
  LEVEL 065 - REWIND Tapes before initting in INITVOLS                  01059
              processing.                                               01060
              HEXPRT now works for INITVOLS.                            01061
              HEXPRT now prints the external labels in a                01062
              LABADDIN operation.                                       01063
              TAPEOWNER= is now honored for an INITVOLS                 01064
              operation (this fixes a bug).                             01065
              Number for FILELIMIT=nnn is now filled in,                01066
              in the message, when the EBCDIC value                     01067
              exists.                                                   01068
              Fix another bug--Tape Owner not altered--                 01069
              now use the value of tape owner passed from               01070
              the PARMCHEK program.                                     01071
                                                                        01072
  LEVEL 066 - Cosmetic changes.                                         01073
                                                                        01077
  LEVEL 067 - Introduce ability to INIT ASCII tapes                     01078
              (ISO/ANSI) Level 3 or Level 4, with the                   01079
              INASC3 or INASC4 keywords.  You can control               01080
              if the HEXPRT is interpreted in EBCDIC or                 01081
              ASCII using the ASCII or the EBCDIC                       01082
              keywords.  For an ASCII tape init, ASCII                  01083
              print interpretation is turned on by                      01084
              default.  If you are initting an ASCII                    01085
              tape using the INASCII keyword, a Level 3                 01086
              ASCII tape will be created.                               01087
                                                                        01088
              ASCII Level 4 is only supported in MVS at                 01089
              the OS/390 2.4 level and higher.                          01090
                                                                         01091
  LEVEL 068 - Split off label checking routine into a                    01091
              separate program, LABELCHK, which is                       01091
              assembled with COPYMODS together.                          01091
                                                                         01091
  LEVEL 069 - More ASCII label detection support.                        01091
              LABLDUMP now works for ASCII tapes.  The                   01091
              control cards in the LABLDUMP DD name have                 01091
              been translated into ASCII, the same as the                01091
              labels and the data.  PARM=STRIP now works                 01091
              for ASCII tapes.                                           01091
                                                                         01091
              Fixed a bug where OUTVOLALL didn't work                    01091
              for volumes other than VOLUME1.                            01091
                                                                         01091
  LEVEL 070 - More ASCII label detection support.                        01091
              LABADDIN works for ASCII tapes now.                        01091
              BLKCNT option fixed to convert corrected                   01091
              block counts to ASCII when necessary.                      01091
              EOVTOEOF now works for ASCII and IBM tapes,                01091
              because a call to LABELCHK now returns the                 01091
              altered copy of INAREA to the main program.                01091
              A parm of EOV2 now requires a space after                  01091
              it, so as not to interfere with EOV2EOF.                   01091
                                                                         01091
  LEVEL 071 - PRINT LABELS support for ASCII tapes.                      01091
                                                                         01091
              LBI support for XXX2 print of label                        01091
              contents.  Big blocksizes are printed                      01091
              in the XXX2 print message if they exist                    01091
              in the labels.  This is for IBM labels.                    01091
                                                                         01091
              Support 14-character tape owner for                        01091
              ANSI/ISO (ASCII) tapes.                                    01091
                                                                         01091
              Other cosmetic changes and many bug fixes.                 01091
                                                                         01091
  LEVEL 072 - Separate all label print operations into a                 01091
              call to a separate CSECT called PRINTLBL.                  01091
              Now there is a unified label print routine                 01091
              for both EXTLBLIN and INAREA label input.                  01091
                                                                         01091
  LEVEL 073 - Separate messages into their own CSECT.                    01091
              Address with PTMS macro, and special setup.                01091
              Assembler instructions which access fields                 01091
              in the MSGCSECT CSECT are created with the                 01091
              new MVFMS macro.                                           01091
                                                                         01091
  LEVEL 074 - Fix LTM service and reporting.                             01091
                                                                         01091
  LEVEL 075 - Implement SECOFF (security indicators in                   01091
              labels turned off in the copied tapes).                    01091
              Involves VOL1 (byte 11) for ASCII tapes.                   01091
              XXX1 (byte 54) which is turned to C'0' for                 01091
              EBCDIC (IBM) tapes, and which is turned to                 01091
              ASCII space (X'20') for ASCII tapes.                       01091
                                                                         01091
  LEVEL 076 - Implement FOOTAGE keyword to measure each                  01091
              tape file approximately, giving a 6250 bpi                 01091
              footage calculation.  This code originally                 01091
              came from the SS0104 tape mapping program                  01091
              from the Florida Power Corporation.                        01091
              Cumulative footages for the entire tape up                 01091
              to the current file, are also displayed.                   01091
                                                                         01091
              Introduced the FOOTDIAG keyword, to print                  01091
              diagnostics in the footage calculation.                    01091
              Most of the FOOTAGE workarea fields are                    01091
              displayed.                                                 01091
                                                                         01091
  LEVEL 077 - Save addressability space by replacing                     01091
              multiple MVFMS invocations with ADRSMS and                 01091
              DROPMS macros, to get addressability to                    01091
              MSGCSECT, and keep it for a while.  Also                   01091
              further reduced the program size by making                 01091
              a PTMSN macro that doesn't re-do the                       01091
              addressability that PTMS does.  This is for                01091
              putting in between a ADRSMS and a DROPMS.                  01091
                                                                         01091
  LEVEL 078 - Add CODEDPRM option to report PARM options                 01091
              before they were adjusted by COPYMODS.                     01091
                                                                         01091
              There was no way to turn off the INITVOLS                  01091
              option with a parm.  So I coded the NOINITVO               01091
              option, to turn off the INITVOLS option                    01091
              bit.  So tape init will only be in effect                  01091
              if INITVOLS is explicitly coded.  Report                   01091
              NOINITVO in the options report, if this                    01091
              option is set off.  Remember that coding                   01091
              the INITVOLS keyword also turns on the                     01091
              CHGVOL option, so that the JCL volser gets                 01091
              propagated into the newly initiated tape.                  01091
              Coding NOINITVO only turns off the INITVOLS                01091
              parm bit, and not the CHGVOL bit, as this                  01091
              should be the proper way to do it.                         01091
                                                                         01091
              If no //OUTn DD cards are coded in the JCL,                01091
              COPYMODS would have run through the WRITEs                 01091
              without writing, and it would look like a                  01091
              normal run.  The logical fix would be to                   01091
              force READONLY on, and say in a message                    01091
              that you have done so. (That's what I did.)                01091
                                                                         01091
  LEVEL 079   Add MINMAX option to report largest and                    01091
              smallest block sizes for each file read.                   01091
                                                                         01091
  LEVEL 080   Added RECSIZE option to report individual                  01091
              size of tape blocks, one at a time.  This                  01091
              option produces one record in SYSPRINT for                 01091
              each tape data block because it is reporting               01091
              that block's size.  So this option should                  01091
              not be a default since it makes a lot of                   01091
              output.  Shows details of the MINMAX                       01091
              display, so RECSIZE implies MINMAX.  If                    01091
              RECSIZE is coded, MINMAX is switched on.                   01091
                                                                         01091
              Got rid of "SBG MM/YY" type comments.                      01091
                                                                         01091
  LEVEL 081   Fix problem in PARM=STRIP code where a
              label image in the middle of tape data was
              stripped off.

  LEVEL 082   Fix problem in PARM=STRIP code where an
              80-byte tape block would cause no tape mark
              to be written at the end of the current
              file.  Made STRIP diagnostics a separate
              parm called DGSTRI and NODGSTRI.

  LEVEL 083   Fix carriage control column for STRIP
              diagnostic messages.  Option DGSTRI.

  LEVEL 084   Added option SHOOVL, which displays
              the first 80 bytes of the first block of
              each output tape, to determine if it is
              a VOL1 label, and what kind of VOL1 label.
              Added option KEEPVOL, KEEPVL.  This option
              looks at the VOL1 label of the output tape,
              and keeps it in the copied tape, if the
              input tape VOL1 label is compatible with it.
              The principal reason for having this, is if
              a scratch tape is the copied tape, you do
              not necessarily know its volser in advance.
                                                                         01091
                                                                         01091
