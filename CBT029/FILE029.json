THIS PROCEDURE WAS SUGGESTED TO ME BY JEFF BROIDO, WHO\n        USED IT ONCE SOME YEARS AGO.  I HAD THE NEED TO DO IT RECENTLY,\n        AND I MENTIONED TO ARNOLD CASINGHINO THAT I WAS SUCCESSFUL IN\n        THE ENDEAVOR OF ENLARGING A VTOC \"NON-DESTRUCTIVELY\".  ARNIE\n        INSISTED THAT THERE WAS A NEED, AND THAT I PUT THE PROCEDURE ON\n        THE TAPE.\n\nINGREDIENTS.  I THINK IT'LL BE BEST TO WRITE THIS LIKE A RECIPE.  THE\n        MOST HELPFUL TOOL IS THE UCLA FULL SCREEN ZAP PROGRAM THAT CAN\n        BE FOUND ON THE CBT TAPE, FILE 300.  YOU CAN USE OTHER ZAPPING\n        TOOLS, BUT THIS ONE ENABLES YOU TO REALLY SEE WHAT IS GOING\n        ON, AND IT'S FAST.  (TO USE FULL SCREEN ZAP TO UPDATE A VTOC,\n        IT'LL HAVE TO RUN AUTHORIZED.  ZAP YOUR IKJEFTE2 WITH THE NAME\n        \"ZAP\" AND PUT THE PROGRAM IN AN AUTHORIZED LIBRARY, AND MAKE\n        SURE IT'S LINKEDITED WITH SETCODE AC(1).  AUTHORIZE IT ANOTHER\n        WAY IF YOU'RE SOPHISTICATED.)  YOU'LL NEED AN MVS SPL DEBUGGING\n        GUIDE TO SHOW YOU THE FORMAT OF THE DIFFERENT DSCB'S (VTOC\n        ENTRIES).  I SHALL ASSUME THAT YOU HAVE A DEBUGGING GUIDE.  IF\n        YOU ARE REALLY STUCK WITHOUT A DEBUGGING GUIDE, YOU CAN EXPAND\n        THE MACRO IECSDSL1, WHICH MAPS ALL THE VTOC ENTRY FORMATS.\n        THE MACRO IS IN SYS1.AMODGEN.  YOU CAN ASSEMBLE MEMBER\n        VTOCDESC IN THIS PDS, AND YOU'LL GET A DESCRIPTION OF ALL THE\n        FORMAT TYPES.  I'LL ALSO ASSUME YOU HAVE ISPF.  I CERTAINLY\n        HOPE THAT YOU DO!  I'M ALSO INCLUDING 2 JOBS.  THE ONE CALLED\n        OSVTOC CONVERTS A PACK WITH AN INDEXED VTOC INTO AN OLD-STYLE\n        OS VTOC, WHICH WE'LL NEED TO DO, IF THE VTOC IS INDEXED.  THE\n        JOB IXVTOC CONVERTS THE OSVTOC BACK TO INDEXED FORMAT.  YOU'LL\n        DO THIS AFTER YOU'VE ENLARGED THE VTOC, IF IT WAS ORIGINALLY\n        INDEXED.  ONE MORE TOOL IS NECESSARY.  YOU'LL HAVE TO OBTAIN A\n        TRACK MAP OF THE PACK.  THAT IS, YOU'LL NEED TO FIND OUT WHERE\n        YOUR VTOC IS ON THE PACK, AND WHAT DATASETS ARE JUST BELOW IT.\n        (THIS MAKES SENSE, BECAUSE YOU HAVE TO EXPAND THE VTOC TO THE\n        SPACE JUST BEYOND IT.)  I USE THE UCLA VTOCLIST PROGRAM ON\n        FILE 149 OF THE CBT TAPE.  EXECUTE IT WITH PARM=MAP (WHICH\n        GIVES THE TRACK MAP).  IEHMAP WILL DO IT TOO.  IF YOU INSIST\n        ON USING IBM UTILITIES, USE IEHLIST.\n\nPROCEDURE.   ASSUMING YOU NOW HAVE ALL THE INGREDIENTS AVAILABLE, HERE\n        IS WHAT YOU DO.\n\n        1.  MAKE SURE YOU HAVE AT LEAST 5 OR 6 FREE DSCBS (VTOC ENTRIES)\n              ON THE PACK.  THIS IS ESPECIALLY CRITICAL IF THE VTOC IS\n              CURRENTLY IN INDEXED FORMAT.  IF THE VTOC IS NOT INDEXED,\n              THEN ONE OR TWO FREE ENTRIES WILL SUFFICE.  MOVE DATASETS\n              OFF THE PACK, OR DELETE SOME, TO GET THE NECESSARY FREE\n              DSCBS.  (IF YOU DON'T KNOW IF A PACK IS CURRENTLY INDEXED,\n              THERE MUST BE 2 CONDITIONS FOR IT.  THE DS4VTOCI BIT IN\n              THE FORMAT4 DSCB (VOLUME HEADER DSCB) MUST BE ON, AND\n              ALSO, THAT THERE IS AN INDEX DATASET, WITH NAME OF THE\n              TYPE SYS1.VTOCIX.VOLSER ON THE PACK.)\n\n        2.  IF THE PACK IS INDEXED, RUN THE JOB OSVTOC (IN THIS PDS)\n              TO CONVERT THE VTOC TO NON-INDEXED FORMAT.  THIS WILL\n              REQUIRE A FEW FREE DSCBS TO BE AVAILABLE (FOR NEW FORMAT5\n              DSCBS TO DESCRIBE FREE SPACE ON THE PACK).  THE JOB WILL\n              REQUIRE AN OPERATOR REPLY OF \"U\".  THE JOB DOES NOT\n              DELETE THE DATASET SYS1.VTOCIX.VOLSER ON THE PACK.  IN\n              FACT, YOU WILL NEED TO HAVE THIS DATASET LATER, WHEN YOU\n              CONVERT BACK TO INDEXED FORMAT, SO JUST LEAVE IT ALONE.\n\n        3.  GET A TRACK MAP OF THE PACK.  DETERMINE HOW MANY NEW VTOC\n              ENTRIES YOU WANT.  ON A 3380 THERE ARE 53 ENTRIES PER\n              TRACK.  THIS NUMBER, IN BINARY, IS IN FIELD DS4DEVDT\n              OF THE FORMAT4 DSCB.  ONCE YOU'VE DECIDED HOW MANY NEW\n              ENTRIES YOU WANT, CLEAR THE APPROPRIATE NUMBER OF TRACKS\n              JUST AFTER THE EXTENT WHERE THE VTOC CURRENTLY IS.  DO\n              THIS BY MOVING ANY DATASETS THAT ARE THERE OFF THE PACK\n              (OR ANY OTHER WAY THAT WORKS).\n\n        4.  USING THE JOB VTEXALLC IN THIS PDS (MODIFY IT FOR YOUR\n              NEEDS AND USE THE MVS JCL MANUAL FOR REFERENCE), ALLOCATE\n              A NEW DATASET, WITH DCB ATTRIBUTES LRECL=96,KEYLEN=44,\n              DSORG=PS,RECFM=F.  AT THIS POINT, RUN ANOTHER TRACK MAP\n              TO MAKE SURE YOUR NEW DATASET IS RIGHT AFTER THE VTOC.\n              DELETE AND REALLOCATE IF NECESSARY, TILL YOU'VE GOT IT\n              RIGHT.  MAKE SURE THE DATASET HAS ENOUGH TRACKS.  BE\n              CAREFUL WITH THIS.\n\n        5.  NOW EDIT THE DATASET WITH ISPF.  THERE SHOULD BE NO LINES\n              IN THE DATASET.  INSERT A LINE AND SAVE IT.  MAKE SURE\n              YOU ARE NOT IN NUMBER MODE.  TO DO THIS, ISSUE THE ISPF\n              EDIT COMMAND \"NUMBER OFF\".  THE TWO COMMANDS IN\n              SUCCESSION \"RENUM\" THEN \"UNNUM\" WILL ALSO DO IT.  GET\n              INTO HEX MODE (ISPF COMMAND \"HEX\").  CONVERT EVERY BLANK\n              TO X'00'.  MAKE SURE YOU'VE DONE IT FOR ALL 140\n              CHARACTERS.  BE VERY CAREFUL.  THEN SAVE THE LINE AGAIN.\n              REPEAT THE LINE OF HEX ZEROS MANY TIMES (DO IT MORE THAN\n              THE 795 ENTRIES PER 3380- CYLINDER.)  NOW ATTEMPT TO\n              SAVE THE EDIT.  IF YOU DON'T GO DOWN WITH A D37 ABEND,\n              YOU PROBABLY DIDN'T REPEAT THE LINE ENOUGH TIMES TO FILL\n              ALL THE TRACKS OF THE DATASET.  MAKE SURE YOU GET ABEND\n              D37 ON THE SAVE.  IF NOT, REPEAT THE LINE (EACH LINE\n              BECOMES A NEW FORMAT0 VTOC ENTRY) MORE TIMES, AND SAVE\n              AGAIN, TILL YOU GET AN ABEND D37.  THE ATTEMPTED \"SAVE\"\n              HAS NOW FORMATTED THE DATASET TO LOOK SOMETHING LIKE A\n              BLANK VTOC.\n\n        6.  NOW YOU HAVE TO USE FULL SCREEN ZAP.  IF YOU'RE USING\n              ANOTHER ZAPPING TOOL, YOU CAN ACCOMPLISH THE SAME THINGS\n              WITH IT, BUT PROBABLY NOT AS EASILY.  TO GET THE FORMAT4\n              VTOC ENTRY ON THE TSO SCREEN, YOU HAVE TO HAVE A CATALOGED\n              DATASET ON THE PACK.  IF THERE ARE NONE, CATALOG A NONVSAM\n              DATASET ON THE PACK (WITH ISPF 3.2) USING SOME GARBAGE\n              NAME.  (THIS IS WHAT YOU NEED ANOTHER FREE DSCB FOR.)\n              SEE MEMBER ZAPINSTR IN THIS PDS FOR INSTRUCTIONS HOW TO\n              LOOK AT AND MODIFY VTOC ENTRIES WITH THE UCLA FULL SCREEN\n              ZAP PROGRAM.  (I'LL ASSUME HENCEFORTH THAT YOU KNOW HOW\n              TO DO THIS.)  YOU SHOULD KEEP A TRACK MAP OF THE PACK\n              IN FRONT OF YOU.  YOU MUST NOW CHANGE TWO THINGS ON THE\n              FORMAT4.  NUMBER ONE, YOU MUST MODIFY THE SECOND EXTENT\n              DESCRIPTOR (GIVING THE HIGH TRACK ADDRESS - THE UPPER\n              LIMIT OF THE VTOC) SO IT POINTS TO THE END OF YOUR NEW\n              EXTENSION DATASET THAT YOU PUT AFTER THE VTOC.  THE\n              LAYOUT OF THE EXTENT DESCRIPTORS IS DESCRIBED IN DETAIL\n              UNDER FORMAT3 (DETAILED IN THE SPL DEBUGGING GUIDE UNDER\n              CONTROL BLOCK DSCB3) THEY ARE 10 BYTES IN LENGTH AND\n              GIVE THE CYLINDER AND TRACK NUMBERS IN BINARY.  IF YOU\n              USED VTOCLIST TO GET THE TRACK MAP, AND FULL SCREEN ZAP\n              TO SEE THE FORMAT4 DSCB, IT SHOULD BE QUITE CLEAR WHERE\n              THE DESCRIPTORS ARE.  USE THE DEBUGGING GUIDE (DSCB4) OR\n              THE ASSEMBLY OF THE MAPPING MACRO (DESCRIBED ABOVE) AND\n              BE CAREFUL.  WHEN YOU ARE SATISFIED YOU'VE DONE\n              EVERYTHING RIGHT (YOU CAN RUIN ACCESS TO THE PACK IF YOU\n              DIDN'T), MAKE THE CHANGE PERMANENT.  NOW YOU MUST TURN\n              THE DIRF BIT ON, THIS IS DS4DIRF ON THE FORMAT4.  MAKE\n              THE CHANGE PERMANENT.  FINALLY, YOU MUST DELETE THE VTOC\n              ENTRY FOR THE NEW DATASET WHICH IS RIGHT AFTER THE VTOC.\n              THIS IS SO THAT THE VTOC \"THINKS\" THAT THERE IS FREE\n              SPACE THERE.  YOU DO THIS BY SETTING THE ENTIRE ENTRY TO\n              HEX ZEROS.  IN FULL SCREEN ZAP, THE \"F\" COMMAND\n              F/DSNAME/ CAN BE USED TO FIND THE CORRECT FORMAT1 DSCB,\n              THE COMMAND \"SET00\" SETS THE ENTIRE RECORD TO HEX ZEROS,\n              AND THE COMMAND \"ZAP\" MAKES THE CHANGE PERMANENT.\n\n              THESE 3 ITEMS:  (CHANGING THE SECOND EXTENT DESCRIPTOR\n              AND TURNING ON THE DIRF BIT IN THE FORMAT4.  ZEROING OUT\n              THE FORMAT1 VTOC ENTRY OF YOUR NEW FORMATTED VTOC\n              EXTENSION DATASET) COMPLETE THE VTOC ZAPS THAT MUST BE\n              DONE.\n\n        7.  NOW GET OUT OF ZAP, GET A ZAP LOG, AND GET INTO ISPF 3.2.\n              TRY TO ALLOCATE ANOTHER DATASET ON THE PACK.  IF YOU\n              HAVE ACCESS TO AN OPERATOR CONSOLE, YOU SHOULD SEE A\n              MESSAGE TO THE EFFECT: \"VTOC CONVERT ROUTINE ENTERED -\n              REASON DIRF\".  THIS SHOULD PROBABLY BE THE ONLY CONSOLE\n              MESSAGE YOU GET.  YOU MAY GET A MESSAGE THAT THE ROUTINE\n              WAS SUCCESSFUL, BUT YOU MAY NOT.  IN ANY CASE, IF YOU\n              GET ANY MESSAGE THAT THE ROUTINE WAS UNSUCCESSFUL, YOU\n              SHOULD IMMEDIATELY SET THE FORMAT4 DSCB BACK TO WHAT IT\n              WAS (SO YOU DON'T KILL ACCESS TO THE PACK), SCRATCH YOUR\n              HEAD, AND TRY AGAIN.  I'LL ASSUME YOU WERE SUCCESSFUL SO\n              WE'LL LOOK AT THE NEXT STEP.\n\n        8.  YOU NOW SHOULD HAVE AN EXTENDED VTOC.  RUN VTOCLIST AGAIN\n              TO VERIFY THE NUMBER OF FREE DSCBS ON THE PACK, OR USE\n              ISPF 3.7, OR ANY OTHER METHOD OF CHECKING THE NUMBER OF\n              FREE DSCBS.  IF YOUR VTOC WAS ORIGINALLY NOT INDEXED,\n              YOU'RE HOME FREE.  OTHERWISE,\n\n        9.  RUN THE JOB IXVTOC TO RECONVERT THE VTOC BACK TO INDEXED\n              FORMAT.  REMEMBER THAT THE OPERATOR WILL HAVE TO REPLY\n              \"U\".\n\n       10.

THIS IS JIM MARSHALL'S LIBRARY OF TSO COMMANDS.\n\n I ASSUME YOU HAVE THE ZAP PROGRAM PROPERLY INSTALLED.  IT IS A TSO\n    COMMAND, AND IT MUST BE EXECUTED AUTHORIZED IN ORDER TO ZAP A VTOC\n    ENTRY.  IF YOU CAN'T DO THIS, PLEASE CONSULT YOUR LOCAL TSO GURU\n    UNTIL YOU'VE GOTTEN IT RIGHT.  (FOR MOST USES, ZAP DOESN'T HAVE\n    TO BE AUTHORIZED).\n\n TO GET TO THE VTOC ON A GIVEN PACK DO THE FOLLOWING: (I AM ASSUMING\n    THAT THE PACK NAME IS PACK01, AND THERE IS A CATALOGED DATASET\n    ON PACK01 CALLED SYS2.DATASET).\n\n      A.  INVOKE THE ZAP PROGRAM AUTHORIZED:\n                   ( ENTER THE COMMAND:  ZAP  )\n                   (  IN MY SHOP, THERE'S A \"MAGIC\" SVC, SO I\n                        ENTER EITHER \"OP Z\" OR \"$$ ZAP\" )\n\n      B.

IF YOU'RE ZAPPING ANOTHER DATASET, JUST ENTER\n                       ITS TSO-QUALIFIED NAME.\n\n      C.

CHANGES ARE MADE PERMANENT WITH THE COMMAND\n              \"ZAP\".\n\n      D.  ADVICE:  LEARN THE TUTORIAL FIRST.  YOU CAN ALWAYS GET\n              INTO IT BY ENTERING \"?\" ON THE CMD LINE, AND BACK TO\n              WHERE YOU WERE BY ENTERING \"U\" ON THE COMMAND LINE.\n              THE TUTORIAL HAS 13 SCREENS.  AT LEAST GLANCE AT THEM ALL.\n              YOU DON'T PUT SPACES BETWEEN THE COMMAND AND THE OPERAND.\n              THE COMMAND \"END\" QUITS YOU OUT OF ZAP AT ANY TIME.\n              THE COMMAND \"P\" GETS YOU TO THE BEGINNING OF THE FORMAT4.\n              THERE IS A LITTLE ARROW \"<\" OR \">\" THAT POINTS TO\n              THE CURRENT BYTE.  GO FORWARD AND BACKWARD BY ENTERING\n              PLUS OR MINUS THE NUMBER OF BYTES IN HEX.  FOR EXAMPLE:\n              +3 (3 BYTES FORWARD), -C (X'C' BYTES BACKWARD), ETC.\n              TO SUBSTITUE UP TO 8 BYTES STARTING FROM THE CURRENT\n              BYTE, ENTER \"S\" FOLLOWED BY A HEX VALUE--NO SPACES IN\n              BETWEEN.  TO MAKE CHANGES PERMANENT, ENTER \"ZAP\".\n              ALWAYS GET A ZAP LOG IF YOU'VE CHANGED SOMETHING, UNTIL\n              YOU'RE COMPLETELY FAMILIAR WITH THE PROGRAM.\n\n  ******      IT IS ADVISABLE TO ZAP SOME LESS-MEANINGFUL DATASETS\n  ******      BEFORE TACKLING A VTOC.\n\n\n\n", "mimetype": "text/plain", "datatype": "ebcdic", "extension": ".txt"}}}}, "SCRIPTOPTIONS": {"filename": "./CBT029/FILE029.XMI", "LRECL": 80, "loglevel": 30, "outputfolder": "CBT029", "encoding": "cp1140", "unnum": true, "quiet": false, "force": false, "binary": false, "modifydate": true}}
