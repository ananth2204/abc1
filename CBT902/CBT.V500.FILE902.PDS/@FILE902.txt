//***FILE 902 is from Jay Moseley and contains date conversion      *   FILE 902
//*           routines written in Assembler.  These were originally *   FILE 902
//*           written for Y2K purposes, but they can prove useful   *   FILE 902
//*           in other situations as well.                          *   FILE 902

//*           The structure of each of these programs allows them   *   FILE 902
//*           to be called by COBOL programs and return the data    *   FILE 902
//*           to the calling program.                               *   FILE 902
