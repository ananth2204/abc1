//***FILE 928 is from Ze'ev Atlas and contains some code which      *   FILE 928
//*           is an adaptation of the regex.h header file to        *   FILE 928
//*           COBOL copybooks.  This is V1 of the package.          *   FILE 928
//*                                                                 *   FILE 928
//*       This is V1 of the package, correcting some issues and     *   FILE 928
//*       replacing the initial V0.                                 *   FILE 928
//*                                                                 *   FILE 928
//*       Please examine the REGEXDEM program to see how it         *   FILE 928
//*       works.                                                    *   FILE 928

//*       Thank you                                                 *   FILE 928

//*       This little package is an adaptation of the regex.h       *   FILE 928
//*       header file to COBOL copybooks.  By using these           *   FILE 928
//*       copybooks and the standard IBM C Run-time library (that   *   FILE 928
//*       is available in all z/OS machines as far as I can         *   FILE 928
//*       tell), one may do pattern matching using Regular          *   FILE 928
//*       Expression from COBOL.  I am not the first or only        *   FILE 928
//*       person who uses this capability.  My contribution is by   *   FILE 928
//*       providing standard copybooks and explaining how to use    *   FILE 928
//*       the 'Capture' capability in addition to the common        *   FILE 928
//*       'Match' capability.                                       *   FILE 928

//*       One has now a common interface to these functions:        *   FILE 928
//*       regcomp()   Compile regular expression                    *   FILE 928
//*       regerror()  Return error message                          *   FILE 928
//*       regexec()   Execute compiled regular expression           *   FILE 928
//*       regfree()   Free memory for regular expression            *   FILE 928
//*                                                                 *   FILE 928
