Hi Sam
This little package is an adaptation of the regex.h header file
to COBOL copybooks.  By using these copybooks and the standard
IBM C Run-time library (that is available in all z/OS machines as
far as I can tell), one may do pattern matching using Regular
Expression from COBOL.  I am not the first or only person who
uses this capability.  My contribution is by providing standard
copybooks and explaining how to use the 'Capture' capability in
addition to the common 'Match' capability.

One has now a common interface to these functions:
regcomp()   Compile regular expression
regerror()  Return error message
regexec()   Execute compiled regular expression
regfree()   Free memory for regular expression
