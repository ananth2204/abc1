//***FILE 837 is from Bruce Bordonaro and contains 2 exits which    *   FILE 837
//*           are necessary to implement, when you want to inform   *   FILE 837
//*           TSO users that there is a file waiting for them to    *   FILE 837
//*           RECEIVE under TSO/E.  The exits are:                  *   FILE 837
//*                                                                 *   FILE 837

//*                   that a dataset is waiting to be RECEIVEd      *   FILE 837
//*                   from another node.                            *   FILE 837

//*                   dataset is waiting to be RECEIVEd from a      *   FILE 837
//*                   local node.  In this case, JES2 exit 13       *   FILE 837
