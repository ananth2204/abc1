                   REXXes using Various APIs

See $INSTALL member on how to install these and make them available.

Most of ideas (and some of the code) included here are a combination
of needing to solve a problem for work, curiosity in how things work,
and inspiration for others (both their ideas and their code).  Much
of the code I have got inspiration from can be found on CBTTape.org.

Why did I implement these solution in REXX?  It interfaces with almost
every sub-system on zOS, has a huge number of capabilities/APIs, and
is easily extensible.  Most of my solutions use REXX & JCL to extend
the capabilities of the sub-systems I already have access to, to fill
in a missing piece of the automation puzzle (Programs & Batch JOBs ARE
Automation).
