It is traditionally held on Thursday night of SHARE week in a\ncorner of the ballroom in which SCIDS is held.  It is probably the\nmost widely and consistently attended session at SHARE except for the\nGeneral Session and is certainly one of the longest running regularly\nscheduled sessions in SHARE history.  The sing-along tradition began\ninformally when a small group of loyal HASP users (the predecessor to\nJES2) and IBMers would gather in one corner of SCIDS around a piano\nto sing old camp songs and familiar melodies with lyrics they had\n\"adjusted\" to topics appropriate to HASP and SHARE.  In the spring of\n1970 in New York the sing-along appeared for the first time in the\nSHARE agenda under the title HASP Project Esprit de Corps.  The\nsing-along has had its share of ups and downs.  A few SHARE meetings\nhave been without the session for one reason or another and most of\nthe original organizers and supporters have left the industry,\nretired, or no longer attend SHARE.  But for the most part the\ntradition has grown and remained a high-point of SHARE week.  Some of\nthe song lyrics in this book may seem a bit mysterious and arcane to\nmany of you newer to the \"systems\" business and SHARE.  Back in the\n\"good old days\" we sang about \"readers\" and \"writers\" and pseudo-DDs,\ngreen cards that were really green, SYSGENs3 and IPLs4.  Today the\nlyrics are more up-to-date.  We no longer sing just about HASP (or\nJES2) but about everything from DB2 and Rolm phones, to personal\ncomputers.  In fact, some people say you can get a good sense of the\nhistory of the information processing industry over the last twenty\nyears just by thumbing through the pages of this song book.  The songs\nin this book, those which we actually sing at the session, are popular\nmelodies taken from such diverse musical areas as Broadway musicals,\nRock, Opera, Country/Western, Top 40, Pop and Folk.  These songs have\n\"enhanced\" lyrics written by SHARE members about their favorite topic:\nhardware and software system products.  Everyone at SHARE is invited\nto turn a creative hand to producing new songs for our session.  While\nthere are no restrictions on what tunes can be used, the most\nsuccessful offerings are those melodies instantly recognized by most\npeople and that are very \"singable\".  Of course \"singable\" is a\nrelative term.  Lyrics should be topical, about software and hardware\nsystems, and should fit the meter and phrasing of the song.  Lyrics\nshould be in good taste.  Profanity and libel are unacceptable and\nproper names (especially last names) are discouraged.  Humor, puns,\njokes, and onomatopoeia are strongly encouraged but difficult to\nachieve (and harder to spell).  Prizes, peer acclaim and a place in\nthis book await the authors and songs judged best at each SHARE\nmeeting.\n\nSubmitting Songs\n\nSong submissions are accepted starting Monday of SHARE week and may be\ndelivered to the Esprit de Corps mailbox in SHARE Headquarters anytime\nduring the normal hours of that office.  All submissions must be\ndelivered by 12:00 Noon on Wednesday of SHARE week.  The last pickup\nfrom the mailbox will be made at 12:30PM on Wednesday afternoon.\nSongs received after that will be held over to the next SHARE meeting.\nSong submissions may also be delivered directly to the Session\nSpeaker, the JES2 Project Manager, or a JES2 Project Deputy.\n\nPreference for Electronically Submitted Lyrics\n\nPreference will be given to song lyrics that are submitted in machine\nreadable format, on appropriate media, and in suitable format\n(described below).  Song  lyrics that are submitted on paper\n(including punch cards, cocktail napkins, and the like) will be\nconsidered for use only if time to prepare them for display is\navailable.  Paper submissions that are not used at the current SHARE\nmeeting may be converted to machine readable format and held over to\nthe next SHARE meeting.\n\nMedia\n\nSubmissions will be accepted only 3.5\" HDD diskettes.  The diskette\nshould be labeled as shown below and must include a title line\nspecifying the SHARE meeting date with the words \"Song Submission\" and\nat least your name and installation code.\n\nSHARE Song Submission 02/22/1998\n(6 Songs from 4 authors)\n\nJohn Doe (IWC)\nInternational Widget Corporation\n123 Sesame Street\nMid Town, MA 02135\n\nInformation Processing Center\nMail Point 3-N-90A\n\nContent\n\nEach diskette may contain as many song submissions as you wish and\nthese submissions need not all be from the same author(s) or\ninstallation.  Each song submission must be a separate PC DOS ASCII\ntext file.  Songs formatted according to the rules described below are\npreferable, though any song submitted as a DOS ASCII text file will be\nconsidered in machine readable format.  Regardless of the format of\nyour submission, to be eligible each song file must contain at least:\n\n* A title, source, or other information that identifies\n  the melody being used. If the song is unusual or likely to be\n  unfamiliar to the organizers of the sing-along you must attach sheet\n  music to your submission. (Please observe relevant copyright and\n  royalty laws when copying sheet music.\n\n* The names and installation codes of the authors of the \"enhanced\"\n  song lyrics.  Anonymous submissions are permitted but should be\n  designated as such in lieu of supplying an author's name.\n\nConventions and Notation\n\nWhen typing your song lyrics there are some conventions you should\nobserve to help make your song suitable to be displayed and sung.\nThis notation helps people know how you intend the lyrics of the song\nto be sung in relation to the melody.  Mostly, normal punctuation and\nspelling is used.  Each verse of the song is written as a series of\nlines similar to the lines of a poem.\n\nEmphasis, Expansion, and Contraction\n\nSometimes a longer word in the new lyrics for a song are is used to\nreplace several shorter words in the original lyrics.  When this is\ndone the meter and phrasing of the song may require that some or all\nof the syllables in a word be emphasized or sung individually.  In\nthese cases the individual parts of a word to be sung are set off with\nhyphens.  For example, if \"in-tu-it-ively\" were written then each\nhyphenated section of the word would be sung separately.  Contractions\nare indicated with apostrophes.  Apostrophes can be used anywhere in a\nword, even before the first letter to drop syllables that are not\nsung.  For example, \"Because\" is often contracted as \"'Cause\"\n(pronounced \"kuz\").  Contractions are also common at the end of words\nsuch as \"workin'\" (working) or \"SHAREin'\" (SHAREing).  Sometimes a\nsyllable in a word should be held across several notes.  Holding can\nbe used when your wording has fewer syllables than required by the\nsongs phrasing, but this should be avoided when possible.  Held\nsyllables are usually indicated using hyphens and/or repeated letters\nor ellipses at the end of a line.  For example, \"AaaaBEND...\" is held\nlong at the end of a song, or \"paging\" might be sung with an elongated\n\"a\" sound.\n\nPronunciation, Spelled Words and Numbers\n\nWhen words are spelled out in capital letters separated by hyphens,\nthe spelling of the word is sung.  For example, \"S-C-A-T\" would be\nsung as \"es-cee-a-tee\".\n\nIf a word is capitalized but not hyphenated, such as \"SYSGEN\" or\n\"APAR\" then the conventional pronunciation used in data processing\nparlance will be sung.  In this case \"sis-jen\" and \"ay-par\".\n\nIf an alternate or unconventional pronunciation is desired or if a\nword is uncommon then specific singing instructions may be included as\na parenthetical remark in the song text.  For example: CICS (say\nkicks).\n\nIn most cases numbers in songs are sung according to the same\nconvention as capitalized words.  For example, 360 would likely be\nsung as \"three-sixty\".  Where it is not clear how a number should be\nsung or to make certain that a number is sung as required it is better\nto spell out the pronunciation.  For example, \"ninety-six-seventy-two\"\ninstead of 9672.\n\nSong Tag Language\n\nIn the past, overhead transparencies were also produced from DCF\nScript input files.  More recently, a set of display programs that\ndrive a video graphics projector has been used as the SHARE Esprit de\nCorps session.  These methods depend on a special set of SCRIPT tags\ndesigned specifically to format songs.  While it is not required, if\nyou wish, you may \"mark up\" your song submissions with these tags to\nassist us in preparing your song for display.  The tags are defined as\nDCF (SCRIPT) macros and operated like normal DCF tags.  Some tags,\nlike SONG, VERSE, CHORUS and REPEAT are used to delineate parts of the\nsong.  For printing or display they control appropriate formatting and\npagination.  Other tags, like SONG, BY and KEY are used to format\nindexes and the table of contents in the printed song book and to\ncreate catalogs for the song display programs.  Some tags that permit\ncharacter string operands such as titles require that the parameter\nstrings be enclosed in single quotation marks if the string contains\nblanks and/or if more than one string parameter is present.  For\nexample:\n\n.SONG 'My Country Tis of Thee' 'God Save The Queen'\n\nIf a character string operand contains a single quotation mark (or\napostrophe) then each single quotation mark is entered as two adjacent\nsingle  quotation marks.  For example:\n\n.SONG 'There''s No Business Like Show Business'\n\nSONG\n\n\n.SONG 'title' ['subtitle']\n\nThe SONG tag is used to begin a song and specify the title of the song\nand optional subtitle.  The information on the SONG tag in your file\nshould be the original title of the song (if you know it) or something\nthat will give people a clue as to what melody you intend the lyrics\nto fit.  The optional subtitle can be used to specify an alternate\nname for the song or further information that will help identify the\nsong's melody such as:\n\n.SONG 'Suicide is Painless' 'M*A*S*H TV Theme'\n\n.SONG 'If I Only Had a Brain' 'from the Wizard of OZ'\n\nThe SONG tag is used to indicate the title at the top of a song in the\nsong book or at the top of the screen on the display.  Any optional\nsubtitle will appear in italics after the main title.  The SONG tag is\nalso used to create index and table of contents entries in the song\nbook and catalog entries used by the song display program.  There\nshould only be one SONG tag in any DOS ASCII text file that you\nsubmit.\n\nBY\n\n\n.BY author-information\n\nThe BY tag is used to include the names and installation codes of song\nauthors in the song file.  BY tags are used only in producing internal\ncatalogs and statistics.  Authors names are not included in the song\nbook or displayed by the song display programs.  You may include as\nmany BY tags in song files as there are authors of your \"enhanced\"\nlyrics.  The author-information specified may be anything and need not\nbe enclosed in quotation marks.  You should include at least the\nauthors first and last names and their SHARE installation code.  If\nyour song submission is to remain anonymous then you should include a\nBY tag with the string \"ANONYMOUS\" in place of the author's name.\n\nVERSE\n\n\n.VERSE <'optional title for medleys'>\n\nThe VERSE tag is used to delineate the verses of a song.  Each verse\nof the song, including the first, should be preceded by a VERSE tag.\nIn addition to beginning each verse, a title may be used in a medley\nwhere the melody of each verse may be different.  The VERSE tag is\nused to control pagination and scrolling in the song book and display\nprogram respectively.  When the optional title is specified in a\nmedley verse the optional title is included as a title on the printed\nor displayed verse.\n\nCHORUS\n\n\n.CHORUS\n\nThe CHORUS tag is used either to store a repeating chorus verse or to\nrepeat a previously stored chorus verse.  When the same wording is\nused over and over again in the song as a chorus the CHORUS tag should\nbe used.  However, if each chorus of the song is sung with slightly\n(or greatly) different wording then the choruses are treated as normal\nverses and the VERSE tag must be used.\n\nThe first time the CHORUS tag is encountered all the song lines\nfollowing the tag up to the next CHORUS or VERSE tag are saved.  Then,\nevery time a CHORUS tag is encountered the saved chorus is\nautomatically inserted in the displayed song.\n\nFor example, in the song \"It's A Small, Small, World (No. 1)\" printed\nbelow, the chorus beginning \"It's a HASP world after all...\" would\nappear after each verse since a CHORUS tag appears after each verse.\nNote also, that the CHORUS tag before and after (and terminates) the\nsaved text of the chorus is necessary to make the chorus appear after\nthe first verse.\n\n.SONG 'It''s A Small, Small World (No. 1)'\n\n.VERSE\nIt's a world of paging, a world of swaps,\nIt's a world of staging and multidrops,\nThough I'm running JES-2 on my new C-P-U,\nIt's a HASP world after all.\n.CHORUS\nIt's a HASP world after all,\nIt's a HASP world after all,\nIt's a HASP world after all,\nIt's a new HASP world.\n.CHORUS\n.VERSE\nWe can SHARE our SPOOLs,\nWe can fill our queues,\nOn our U-P, A-P, and M-P-Us,\nAlthough I-B-M says\nthat its new name is JES,\nIt's a HASP world after all.\n.CHORUS\n.VERSE\nTo improve response and remove distress,\nJES-2 runs the show under M-V-S.\nThough it's now called JES-2,\nIt's a HASP world after all.\n.CHORUS\nREPEAT\n\n\n.REPEAT\n\nThe REPEAT tag is used in very short songs to cause the entire song to\nbe sung a second time.  In the song book the notation \"(REPEAT)\" is\nprinted at the bottom of the song.

nineteen-sixty, and may last 'til nineteen-ninety-three.\n\nBack then we had many computers, from STRETCH to the fourteen-oh-one,\nwith so many different instructions, we all could have oodles of fun.\n\nBut I-B-M wanted new profits, and a product con-sis-tency.\nSo they designed System three-sixty as an arch-i-tecture fam-ily.\n\nThree-sixty had many instructions,\nthat were to remember too hard.\nSo ol' I-B-M went and printed a multi-page green reference card.\nchorus\nA multi-page green reference car-aa-ard\nA multi-page green reference card\nSo ol' I-B-M went and printed\nA multi-page green reference card.\n\nThen one day about ten years later, a bold blue announcement proclaimed\nthat we'd soon be buying new systems\nThree-Seventy was the new name.\n\nIt still had the same old instructions, and some new that we'd never seen.\nAnd just to add to the confusion, the new reference card was not green.\n\nThree-Seventy's Virtual Storage, runs with a DAT box you know.\nThe trouble is Virtual Storage, also uses a DASD that's slow.\n\nV-S-2 is the new con-trol program.\nThey promised us it would run fast.\nThey told us it never runs slower than O-S  P-C-P without HASP.\nchorus\nThan O-S P-C-P without HA-A-SP.\nThan O-S P-C-P without HASP.\nThey told it never ran slower than\nO-S P-C-P without HASP.\n\nAnother few years in conversion, from old O-S to new M-V-S.\nAnd now a new Ex-tended version\nmeans one more time 'round with this mess.\n\nCross Memory is new arch-i-tecture,\nthat extended addressing at last.\nIf only I could understand it, and figure out why it's called DAS.\n\nThey've added some new I/O features.\nThe one that they call \"channel queue\",\ncan handle concurrent instructions, as long as it's no more than two.\n\nAnother great I/O enhancement is titled \"resume and suspend\".\nThey use it to write channel programs,\nthat do paging I/O without \"end\".\nchorus\nThat do paging I/O without \"e-e-nd\".\nThat do paging I/O without \"end\".\nThey use it to write channel programs, that do\npaging I/O without \"end\".\n\nOh, that's not the last of the story.\nThe ending has yet to be told.\nAnd nobody standin' here singin', can

could not fail\nIt printed jobs and punched my cards\nAnd e-ven did NET-mail\n\nMy users were unhappy, M-V-S was hard to learn\nThey wanted something eas-i-er, a place where they could turn\n\nSo when my boss assigned me, to find a better way\nI started searching for soft-ware\nThat might make their day\n\nI thought we would try U-NIX, but that was even worse\nWhile I-B-M has P-L-S, 'C' is far too terse\n\nMy time was running out, and I was not inspired\nI knew it would be two more weeks\nBefore I would be fired\nchorus\n\nI was getting worried, and so I came to SHARE\nI asked around and what I found\nWas a big teddy BEAR\n\nSoftware that was simple, Eas-y to understand\nWith V-M in the world today\nAll others should be canned\n\nMy users were now happy, Content and worry free\nV-M and friendly C-M-S\nSure saved the day for me\n\nThe only thing I'll miss, that M-V-S pro-vides\nIs all that great JES-2 source code\nThat I-B-M can't hide\nchorus\n\nSome systems live forever, but not so M-V-S\n'Cause T-S-O and S-M-P\nAre too much of a mess\n\nV-M is like heaven, It's software you can trust\nBut as I'm sure you're all aware\nThat source code is a must\n\nMy eyes looked t'ward tomorrow, as I scratched my C-D-S\nI'd never have to worry now\nWhich SYS-MODS I'd regress\n\nWithout a super-visor, JES-2 could not be run\nAnd so that code of Houston fame\nJust rode into the sun.\nchorus\n\nSong 118 I'm a Lumberjack and I'm OK (Monty Python)\nchorus\nI do M-V-S and I'm O-K.\nI work all night, and I work all day\nV-M makes it easy, we're going to X-A\n\nWith INFO-SYS , I scan the queue.\nI'm going to turn blue.\nI'm waiting for my phone to ring.\nI'm queued at level two.\nchorus\n\nN-J-E Is alright too, it works just like they said.\nOff-load did not work too well.\nMy users want me dead.\nchorus\n\nJES-2 is my latest bug, the change team are all fools.\nThey just gave me one more P-E.\nAnd wiped out all my SPOOLs.\nchorus\n\nTo power up the eighty-one, takes an e-ter-ni-ty\nThis-is just fine with I-B-M\n 'cause users think its me.\nchorus\n\nSong 119 MTA (No. 2)\nchorus\nBut did it ever return, no, it never returned\nAnd its fate is still unlearned\nIt may run forever, if they can't fix the system\nIt's the job that never returned\n\nLet me tell you all the story of a man named Charlie\nOn a tragic and fateful day\nPut his card deck in the reader, read the job into the system\nAnd it started execution in class A.\nchorus\n\nNow this program was so simple (just a hundred lines of FORTRAN)\nWhich had executed perfectly before.\nBut the data being processed got this job into big trouble\nPutting lots and lots of garbage in low core.\n\nCharlie's job kept on a-runnin', in a loop in supervisor\nWhere a user should never be.\nEven op-erator CANCEL couldn't throw it off the system\nFor it's executing with a zero key\n\nCharlie hassles all the clerks working at the ready window\nCrying \"What will become of me?\nCan I tell my supervisor that this simple little program\nPut the operating system on its knees?\"\nchorus\n\nSo the system operator called the chief systems guru\nSaying \"What should I do, pray tell?\nCharlie's job just keeps a-runnin' and it's chewing up the system\nAnd the interactive throughput's gone to hell\n\nNow this guru shook his head for he hadn't any guesses\nOf the reason the job was stuck\n'Cause he hadn't any fiche and he hadn't any source code\nAnd he knew that he was out of luck\nchorus\n\nOh, you customers of Big Blue don't you think that it's a scandal\nO-C-O lets us crash each day.\nFight the system bugs, vote for FULL SOURCE SYSTEMS\nAnd get Charlie's job completed today.\nchorus\nOr it will never return, no 'twill never return\nAnd its fate will stay unlearned.\nIt will run forever if they can't fix the system\nWith no source, we're gonna be burned\n\nSong 120 When Johnny Comes Marching Home\nWhen you I-P-L your M-V-S, Hurrah, Hurrah.\nYou bring up a JES and

would barely run.\nAnd our race to beat the Russians to the moon\nwas not yet won.\nLong before three-seventy and long before V-S.\nWhen good paging algorithms\nwere the dream of T-S-S.\n\nBut I-B-M programmers,\nlike history, have no bounds\nAs to the Spacecraft Center\nthey came from all around.\nThey calculated orbits, designed the launchers tall,\nBuilt the sub-routines\nand the drivers for the good of us all.\n\nBut when their jobs were queued,\nwaiting in the input stack.\nThose programmers grew restless\nfor to get their output back\nTheir minds were overflowing\nwith the President's dead-line.\nHe wants an American on the moon by the end of\nNineteen-Sixty-Nine.\n\nFor they looked to the future and what did they see?\nThey saw their I-B-M computers\nfrom the sea to the sea.\nBringing the profits all up to Armonk\nDistributing dividends from here to Podunk.\n\nLook away, said they, across this mighty land.\nFrom the eastern shore to the western strand.\n\nSwitching the messages and printing the checks,\nComputing all the nation's answers\nin decimal and hex.\nOptimize performance; our stock will go-go.\nGotta write the new spooler\n'Cause the system's too slow.\n\nHelping all the programmers get faster turn-around\nFor Project Apollo down here in Houston-town.\nOpen system bottlenecks; let more jobs flow.\nGotta write the new Spooler\n'Cause the system's too slow.\nWrite the new Spooler\n'Cause the system's too slow.\n\nBehind the green cactus the sun is declining.\nThe stars they come stealing at the close of the day.\nWay off in Houston our loved ones lie sleeping\nBeyond the great freeway in our homes far away.\n\nWe are the coders who work upon The Spooler\nPushing our pencils in the bright Texas sun.\nLiving on barbecue and drinking
