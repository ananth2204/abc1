Here is another free alternative to BPXBATCH/AOPBATCH.  This is
an extension to something I posted a while back called BPXJCL.
It still provides a valid return code in JCL that can be used in
JCL IF and COND processing (the original requirement).  Recently,
our internal requirements changed and the basic BPXJCL REXX EXEC
I posted has grown in size and features.  We needed a way to
execute long and/or multiple commands in JCL.  This was first
provided to implement long (greater that 100 character)
semi-colon separated commands.  Right after this was provided, we
also needed to run long pipeline commands, so a continuation
character was provided.  After both of these were done, it was
requested to provide PROC support so reusable "command members"
could be implemented.

Here is the latest iteration of BPXJCL.  Have fun.  No warranties.
However, if you find any bugs let me know and I will try to fix
them as I have time.  Hopefully, the comments are sufficient to
use it.  All I can say is it works for us...  There is a more
extensive example at the end of this email that was used as an
example and a training tool for our programmers.
