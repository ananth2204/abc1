And I dearly wish I could make "address TSO RECEIVE" work from
the UNIX Rexx environment, especially with no terminal
interaction, as I can achieve by queueing the response in the TSO
Rexx environment.  Is this one of the things that does a TGET
when it would better do a GETLINE?

I was able to get TSO RECEIVE to work in a telnet session using a
REXX wrapper.  The QUICKXMI and QUICKREC EXEC's live in a PDS and
the MVSTSO.REX is in a directory.  I launched the QUICKREC using
my MVSTSO.REX EXEC in a telnet session (see below).  I also have
a LISTDSI wrapper that returns LISTDSI values.  I run it the same
way.  What additional benefit would you get from doing address
TSO RECEIVE?

/* rexx -  QUICKXMI */
arg  dsn
dsn =  strip(dsn,'B',"'")
xmidsn =  dsn'.XMIT'
dsn =  "'"dsn"'"
xmidsn =  "'"xmidsn"'"
"TRANSMIT" sysvar('SYSNODE')'.'userid()  "DSNAME("dsn")",
"OUTDSNAME("xmidsn") SYSOUT(Z)  NOLOG"

/* rexx -  QUICKREC */
arg  xmidsn
say 'Make sure the XMI dataset was uploaded in FB80  format'
xmidsn =  strip(xmidsn,'B',"'")
if  pos('.XMIT',xmidsn) <> 0  then
parse var xmidsn dsn  '.XMIT'
dsn =  "'"dsn"'"
xmidsn =  "'"xmidsn"'"
prompt_on =  prompt('on')
queue  "DSNAME("dsn")"
queue  "SYSOUT(Z)"
"RECEIVE INDSNAME("xmidsn")  NODISPLAY"

/* rexx -  MVSTSO.REX */
arg rexxmem rexxdsn  rexxparms
address TSO "EX '"rexxdsn"("rexxmem")' '"rexxparms"'"

telnet command:

$ mvstso.rex quickrec my.exec my.c.test.xmit
