Subject:  Re: Getting the name of the TCPIP stack with affinity

I found this code in an ISPF/CS article that chases down the TSEB
and lists all the stacks found.

  http://gsf-soft.com/Documents/ISPF-CS.html

CVT-->ECVT-->TSAB-->TSEB

/* REXX - GETSTACK */
cvt  =  c2d(storage(10,4))
ecvt = c2d(storage(d2x(cvt+140),4))
tsab =  c2d(storage(d2x(ecvt+176),4))
do i=1 to  8
tseb = tsab + 64 +  (i-1)*128
say  'Stack' i  storage(d2x(tseb+16),8)
end

However, I could not find the mapping macros for the TSAB or the
TSEB.  Hopefully, they can identify which stack is being used by
the address space...

Note from SBG:  These macros are supplied from CBT File 492
                which is the SHOWzOS macro library.
                EZAZTSAB and EZAZTSEB.

Thanks, but I don't think that any of these calls get the current
stack (aka "image") name.

FWIW - getibmopt() seems promising - it returns an array of the
current stack names on the system.  Unfortunately, it doesn't
seem to indicate which stack is the current/default stack for the
process.
