Subject:  Re: How to list the content of an HFS or zFS file

So, these are currently not mounted and you are just curious what
is in them...  If so, MOUNT each HFS to the same mountpoint
directory and ls -l the contents from the "root" directory (or
use ISHELL).  Even though you do not have ISPF 3.17, you should
have ISHELL (type ISHELL from TSO option 6).

Process:

Create (mkdir) a common mountpoint directory (like
"/what_is_this" off the root)

    1.  MOUNT HFS DSN to the common mountpoint directory
        (mentioned above)
    2.  Use ISHELL to check its contents (using the common
        mountpoint directory as the starting point)
    3.  UNMOUNT HFS
    4.  Rinse and repeat for each HFS in question

After done, remove (rm) your common mountpoint directory.

Hope this helps,
Rob
