Background for Steve McColley.  (by Sam Golob)
---------- --- ----- --------

Steve McColley is one of the VERY FEW JES2 EXPERTS in the United
States, who does NOT work for IBM.  This makes him an extremely
precious commodity.  Steve has supported the famous Mellon Mods
to JES2 for many years, and they are currently maintained on the
CBT Tape collection.

The Mellon Mods to JES2 can be found on CBT Tape files:

File 856  -  For z/OS 1.10 thru 1.13
File 766  -  For z/OS 1.7  thru 1.9
File 702  -  For z/OS 1.4  thru 1.6

The Mellon Mods have been a shop standard for a number of MVS
shops over many years, because they provide a level of job
control and job dependency control (with one job not starting
until requisite jobs have completed) that is not possible with
native JES2 from IBM.  As one can imagine, it takes an extremely
thorough knowledge of JES2 internals, to maintain and enhance
these types of job control facilities under JES2.

     The ESSM Product  -  JES3 functionality under JES2
     --- ---- -------     ---- ------------- ----- ----

In addition to maintaining the Mellon Mods for the benefit of the
public, Steve has undertaken a massive effort, and has developed
a vendor product (priced and supported) called ESSM, which is a
large extension of the Mellon Mods, and which ALSO supplies very
much JES3 functionality from within JES2.  This makes ESSM a
fantastic conversion tool for JES3 shops wishing to convert to
JES2, because you can run much of your JES3 JCL under JES2 with
no changes, using ESSM.

Many shops stand to benefit greatly from using the ESSM product.
