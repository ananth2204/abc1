Hi Sam,
I have written a new disassembler to bring it into the new
millennium, and thought you might like it for the CBT tape. My
earlier disassembler is in file 217, I believe.

This newer version includes all the instructions that have been
added to the instruction set since the earlier version was
written back in the 70's.  Also, it uses the IEWBUFF and IEWBIND
macros to access the load module so that it works properly with
either PDS or PDSE load modules. The code is simpler and should
be easier to maintain now that the complexities of reading and
processing RECFM=U load modules is gone.

If you would like to have this new version, I can sent it in TSO
XMIT format.

I will be retiring June 30th, so won't be around for maintenance
or questions, though I hope to take a copy of the source with me
when I leave, and would be happy to talk or email with anyone who
wishes to discuss the disassembler.

Thanks,
Dick Thornton
