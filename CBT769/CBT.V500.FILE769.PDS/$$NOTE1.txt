Hi all,

Attached is the "final" version of the ZIPped XMIT file containing the
EHIxxxx hilite macros. The dataset contains the following members:

$$$$READ - Disclaimer
$$$INDEX - This member, the index of File 769
EHIASM   - Convert assembler to HTML with ISPF HILITE'ing
EHICOBOL - Convert COBOL to HTML with ISPF HILITE'ing
EHIHELP  - Common 'help' screen for the EHIJCL/PLI/REXX macros
EHIJCL   - Convert JCL to HTML with ISPF HILITE'ing
EHINONE  - Convert any text to HTML as non-HILITE'd ISPF Edit
EHIPLI   - Convert PL/I to HTML with ISPF HILITE'ing
EHIREXX  - Convert REXX to HTML with ISPF HILITE'ing
EHISUPC  - Convert SuperC/Search-For output to HTML with ISPF HILITE'ing
EHISUPP  - Factored out support routines for the EHIxxxx execs
EPANQ    - Convert panel/message/skeleton to queue statements
GPLV3    - Text of the GPL Version 3
MAKECBT  - Exec to auto-build CBTTAPE.EXEC from my own exec library
QH       - Exec to invoke Doug Nadel's ISPFHTML utility

As you can see, I've added a disclaimer, an index, the text of
the GPL V3 and three additional members,

EPANQ   - which can be used to convert anything into a set of
          queue statements,
MAKECBT - the exec I use to automagically build
          'ROBERT.CBTTAPE.XMIT' from my own EXEC library and
QH      - I use this exec to invoke Doug Nadel's ISPFHTML tool.
          In my own copy I have embedded Doug's code by
          'EPANQ'ing his ISPFHTML.XMI file, but as the code is
          quite likely (C) Copyright Doug Nadel (or more likely
          IBM), 'MAKECBT' replaces it by a note how to get it.

Again, please give me some feedback - use <robert@prino.org> or
<robert.ah.prins@gmail.com> as the fin-force address will be gone
after tomorrow  :(

Robert
