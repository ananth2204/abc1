Hi Sam,

Attached is an updated version of the ZIPped XMIT file for file CBT769
containing the EHIxxxx hilite macros.

An incomplete list, see individual changelogs in the various members for
a more complete picture, of the updates I've made to the code:

- the Javascript code to produce the fancy scrollable ISPF like HTML
  has been updated and works again in Firefox 3.x
- fixed a bug in the PL/I and REXX parsing code that would lead to the
  '*** Bottom of Data ***' line being concatenated to the last dataline
  when using Regina
- all generated HTML is now completely W3C "XHTML 1.0 Strict" compliant
- translate '<', '>', '"' and '&' in output to HTML entities
- the addition of 'GETVAR', and using it to retrieve some potentially
  site-specific data, making it easier to customise the code. The change
  was triggered by RACF limitations on the final qualifier at my current
  employer.
- process full SuperC Line compare output
- process full SuperC File compare output (Beta)
- process full SuperC Byte compare output (Beta)
- addition of an 'HTML extension' selection field on the options pop-up
- addition of an 'HTML font' selection field on the options pop-up
- addition of a 'Compact HTML' selection field on the options pop-up, to
  generate one-letter "em" classes, significantly reducing the size of
  generated HTML files
- brought PL/I keywords up to the level of Enterprise PLI V3.8.0
- used BPXWDYN for non-DSNAME allocations, following a discussion in
  bit.listserv.tsorexx about the inability of LISTDSI to retrieve the
  dsname of datasets that might potentially end up on VIO

The dataset contains the following members:

$$$$READ - Disclaimer
$$$INDEX - The index of File 769
EHIASM   - Convert assembler to HTML with ISPF HILITE'ing
EHICOBOL - Convert COBOL to HTML with ISPF HILITE'ing
EHIHELP  - Common 'help' screen for the EHIJCL/PLI/REXX macros
EHIJCL   - Convert JCL to HTML with ISPF HILITE'ing
EHINONE  - Convert any text to HTML as non-HILITE'd ISPF Edit
EHIPLI   - Convert PL/I to HTML with ISPF HILITE'ing
EHIREXX  - Convert REXX to HTML with ISPF HILITE'ing
EHISUPC  - Convert SuperC/Search-For output to HTML with ISPF HILITE'ing
EHISUPP  - Factored out support routines for the EHIxxxx execs
EHIZIP   - Shorten ISPF colors generated by other EHIxxxx execs
EPANQ    - Convert panel/message/skeleton to queue statements
GETVAR   - Retrieve site-dependent data
GPLV3    - Text of the GPL Version 3
MAKECBT  - Exec to auto-build CBT769.EXEC from my own exec library
QH       - Exec to invoke Doug Nadel's ISPFHTML utility

To run the macros, the EHIxxxx members and GETVAR are essential, but I
have added EPANQ, MAKECBT and QH as little bonuses.

EPANQ   - this exec can be used to convert anything into a set of queue
          statements, it can be used to update the embedded panel in
          EHISUPP,
MAKECBT - the exec I use to automagically build 'ROBERT.CBT769.XMIT'
          from my own EXEC library and
QH      - I use this exec to invoke Doug Nadel's ISPFHTML tool. In my
          own copy I have embedded Doug's code by 'EPANQ'ing his
          ISPFHTML.XMI file, but as that code is quite likely (C)
          Copyright Doug Nadel (or more likely IBM), 'MAKECBT'
          replaces it by a note how to get it.

Please note that the XMIT file contains a message dataset. It would be
nice if this survived your adding the usual '$$$#DATE', '$$NOTE1' and
'@FILE769' members.

I would appreciate any feedback to <robert (a) prino (d) org>
