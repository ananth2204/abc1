 Reader's letter

I tried using Jeffry Lee's GETVIS EXEC that was in the August 1987 issue of VM
Update.  I want to point out one major change to make to that EXEC in order for
it to work.  On page 40 of that issue there is a line that that reads as
follows:

       NPART = SUBSTR(FWORD,1,4)+1       /* ADD 1 FOR SYSTEM PART */

It should have been:

       NPART = X2D(SUBSTR(FWORD,1,4))+1  /* ADD 1 FOR SYSTEM PART */

One other area that needs to be modified is the check for parameters.  The EXEC
presented checks only at least one argument is present.  Either verification of
the presence of both arguments should be made or default value(s) should be
assigned.

One final note: users need to have the appropriate classes to issue the DCP
command (usually class C or E) and the lock and unlock commands (usually class
A).
