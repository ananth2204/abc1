Reader's letter

In the December 1990 issue of VM Update, a reader suggested
changes that needed to be made to LEAVE option for VM/XA
DETACH command printed in the June 1990 issue, for sites
using VM/XA SP 2.1 SL201.

There is no need to use these changes because an IBM APAR
is available, VM40200 (PTF UM15443), that adds the
LEAVE/UNLOAD option to the CP DETACH command.  We
put that APAR on when we first installed VM/XA SP 2.1 at
SL202, and it works great - and it is supported by IBM too!
