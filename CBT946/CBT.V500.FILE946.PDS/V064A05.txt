Quick PROFS OPENMAIL

Systems programmers often have the largest virtual RDR Q in
the company.  This discourages them from using OPENMAIL
in PROFS because of the time involved to check all the RDR Q
entries.  On a bad day at our site I experienced a 10-minute
delay waiting for PROFS.  (However, I did have around 300
entries on my RDR Q, each of which was a few thousand
records long.)

To provide me with a solution to this, I have written a simple
REXX EXEC called SCOPEN EXEC and added a few lines of
code to IBM's OPENMAIL EXEC.

When mail is opened in PROFS, a quick check is performed by
SCOPEN to see if there are any spool files that look like
PROFS notes.  If not, a branch is taken to the piece of code
that displays your previous notes.  OPENMAIL is performed
and you will experience the usual delay.  But at least you
should find notes to read afterwards, rather than waiting for a
considerable length of time to find that there isn't any mail
anyway.

COPYFILE the OPENMAIL EXEC to your 191 disk.  If it has
been optimized, use the VMFDEOPT XEDIT macro to de-
optimize it.  After the original comments, add two lines as
follows:

EXEC SCOPEN
&IF &RC NE 0 &GOTO -C00

Just after the CP SLEEP 3 SEC, and just before PROFS
HOLD, add:

-C00

I suspect that fix SM00092 (CV000058) is a prerequisite to this
exercise.

Write the following EXEC called SCOPEN and change the
WHEN statements to suit your site's needs.

This routine works on a VM/XA SP2.1 system running PROFS
2.2.2.0 and should work on a VM/HPO 5 system.
