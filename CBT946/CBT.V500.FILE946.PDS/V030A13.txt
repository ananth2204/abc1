 Reader's letter
We have an Olivetti-Hitachi 32MB processor and run VM/SP HPO 5.0, SQL/DS, VSE/SP
2.1.3 with CICS 1.6 and DL/I 1.7.0, yielding 110 000 CICS-DL/I COPICS-like
transactions per day.
We are planning to migrate from HPO to VM/XA SP 2 in the third quarter of 1989.
We hope to gain the following benefits:
y    Better central storage management
y    SIE support for guests and 24-31 bit addressing
y    XA I/O subsystem management for any guest.
Of course, to gain the third benefit we will declare all VSE/SP 3380 DASD as
mini-disks.  Therefore, XA manages all DASD I/O activity and can use DPS
(Dynamic Path Selection) and DPR (Dynamic Path Reconnect).  (Our conclusion is
based on IBM manual GC26-4430-0, Using the IBM 3380 DASD in a VM environment.)
From the preceding considerations can you confirm if we are correct or have made
any omissions in our analysis, and can we really obtain the benefits listed
above?
