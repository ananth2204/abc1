 Performance hints and tips
The VM/XA SP command SET SRM LDUBUF controls the number of heavy paging users
that the system will allow.  This works by assessing how many paging actuators
each user will tie up.  However, unless you have a very large number of paging
volumes, this is probably not a very sensitive control.
