 Personalised letters
Our installation needed to produce personalised letters using the VM system,
which has a high quality laser printer.  Hence I have written an EXEC and XEDIT
macro that applies a substitution file against a template letter to produce
multiple personalised letters.  Note that each variable can occur many times
within the letter.  Also, the substitution variables are stripped of leading and
trailing blanks;  however, spaces can be forced by use of the underscore
character, which is translated to spaces before substitution.
The format of the MAILLIST command is:
MAILLIST    fn ft fm     fn ft fm
                               filename of the substitution file
                  filename of the template letter

MAILLIST EXEC
/*   Reprint a memo based on a given Mail list                     */
parse upper arg fn_memo ft_memo fm_memo fn_list ft_list fm&list
state fn_memo ft_memo fm_memo          /* Does the memo exist?     */
if rc = 0 then exit                   /* ..exit if not            */
state fn_list ft_list fm_list          /* Does driver file exist   */
if rc = 0  then exit                  /* ..exit if not            */
