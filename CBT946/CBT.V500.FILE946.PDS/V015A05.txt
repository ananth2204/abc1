 PUT and GET prefix macros revisited

In issue 4 I came across two of the more useful prefix macros it has been my
pleasure to use.  The PUT and GET macros were placed on our system disk for the
rest of the users, who discovered the Achilles heel of the PUT macro.

'P' has always stood for 'proceeding' in VM.  Users could not understand why the
block of lines they tried to copy never got copied when they used the 'P'; it
had always worked before.  The new macros were quickly backed out and things
quietened down.

The PREFPUT macro was renamed to the PREFGIVE macro.  PREFGET was renamed to
PREFTAKE.  In the system XEDIT profile, these lines replaced the originals:

  "SET PREFIX SYNONYM T PREFTAKE"
  "SET PREFIX SYNONYM G PREFGIVE"
  "SET PREFIX SYNONYM GG PREFGIVE"

Now instead of PUT and GET, I have GIVE and TAKE.
