Reader's letter

In the letter from Stephen Short, published in issue 59, he
outlines a means to determine the amount of free storage
available to a CMS user.  Unfortunately, the technique Stephen
uses is only valid for CMS Release 5 and earlier releases.
With Release 5.5 CMS free storage management was rewritten.
With the new storage management, the data areas that Stephen
uses are set to zero.  This means that Stephen's program won't
fail, but neither will it provide the desired answer.

Fortunately the new storage management routines are one of
the few areas of new function for which source code is
available.  A routine is provided in the source code to return
storage management statistics.  Knowing this, it is a simple
matter to code a small routine to query these statistics.  The
following is a program to display the amount of free storage
remaining in CMS 5.5 and above.

         PRINT NOGEN
QFREE    START /
         USING QFREE,R12
         USING NUCON,R/
         USING FRWRK,R15
