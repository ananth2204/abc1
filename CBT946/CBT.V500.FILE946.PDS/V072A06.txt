The REXX Handbook contains over 640 pages and is made up
of over 40 chapters, or papers, written by various experts on
their area of REXX expertise. In fact, the first chapter,
describing the origins of REXX, is written by Mike
Cowlishaw, the originator of REXX.

The book looks at all versions of REXX rather than restricting
itself to the VM version and contains eight chapters specifically
for these other platforms. There are three chapters specifically
for VM users. The chapters in the rest of the book are grouped
together under titles such as:General information, Usage, Add-
on products, and In-depth.

The chapters cover a wide range of topics and are, on the
whole, very readable with figures or examples of code helping
to expand the text.

While the book is not meant as a teach-yourself REXX text
book, it is full of good ideas and examples of REXX code,
which makes it a useful addition to the collection of both
beginners and experts.
