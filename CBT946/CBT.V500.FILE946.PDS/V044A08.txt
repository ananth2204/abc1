Introduction to updating

Having recently gone through the learning curve required to
understand IBM's PUT (Program Update Tape) philosophy,
and learn the relationship between the different filetypes
involved, I thought I would jot down some thoughts and
explanations that may be helpful for anyone else going through
the same process.

IBM provides five programs that can be used when installing a
PUT, and generating a new system.  These are:

%   VMFASM - this invokes update commands and assembles
the output to produce a TEXT file.

%   VMFLOAD - this builds a system nucleus.

%   VMFMAC - this generates a new MACLIB.

%   VMFPLC2 - this can be used to manipulate the PUT.

%   VMSERV - this downloads the PUT.

A number of files are used:

%   Auxiliary control files (AUX), which specifies the filetypes
of the Update files to use.

%   Control files (CNTRL), which identify the AUX files and
MACLIBs to use and the filetype of the resulting TEXT
file.

%   LOADLISTs, which are used by VMFLOAD to select the
modules to use when creating the nucleus.

%   TEXT files, which are produced by VMFASM.  They are
equivalent to object decks.

%   Update files, which contain the changes that are to be
made to source files.

FILES USED

AUX files

Auxiliary control files follow the naming convention of
filename (which refer to the module being changed), and a
filetype of AUX with a suffix of SP, TMP or LCL (for
explanation see below).

An example line from an AUX file:

    A12345DK 690 UV98765 FAULT CORRECTION

This specifies that the SLU (Service Level Update) 690 version
of the module is to be built by applying the Update file with the
same module name and a filetype of A12345DK.

CNTRL files

Control files follow the naming convention of filename (which
depends on whether it is SP or HPO that is being installed, and
whether the installation is for a uniprocessor or multiprocessor
configuration).  The filetype is always CNTRL.  CNTRL files
are used by VMFASM and VMFLOAD.  An example of the
contents of a CNTRL file is given below:

    TEXT MACS DMKLCL DMKSP DMSSP CMSLIB OSMACRO

    LCL AUXLCL

    TMP AUXTMP

    TEXT AUXSP11

    TEXT AUXSP1

Of the AUX files specified, AUXSP is IBM standard,
AUXTMP contains temporary changes, and AUXLCL contains
local changes.

LOADLISTs

A LOADLIST is used by VMFLOAD to select the modules
that are to be used to generate a new nucleus.  There are CP
LOADLIST versions for each type of VM system that can be
created (SP, HPO, uniprocessor, etc).  An example of the
contents of a LOADLIST is given below:

    &CONTROL OFF

    &1 &2 &3 DMKLD00E LOADER

    &1 &2 &3 DMKPSA

    other resident modules

    &1 &2 &3 DMKCPE

    pageable modules

    &1 &2 &3 DMKCKP

    &1 &2 &3 LDT  DMKSAVNC

The filetypes, generally, do not have to be specified because
the loader uses CNTRL files to decide what the filetype should
be (eg TEXT, TXTLCL etc).

TEXT files

TEXT files are produced by VMFASM.  They have the same
filename as the associated module, and a filetype of TEXT, or
TXT followed by the word preceding the AUX filetype
statement, eg TXTTMP, or TXTLCL, in the CNTRL file.
VMFLOAD uses the information so that the appropriate TEXT
file is used when the nucleus is built.

Update files

The naming convention used for Update files is to give the file
the same filename as the module to be modified, and a filetype
of xnnnnnaa (where x is 0 for SP, or A for HPO; nnnnn is the
APAR number being applied; aa is DK for DMK modules and
DS for CMS modules).  Update files include update
commands.  They are:

    ./ *     Comment

    ./ D     Deletes a line

    ./ I     Inserts a new line of code

    ./ R     Replaces a line.

The line number of the module to be modified is specified
following a $ sign in the Update file.

COMMANDS AND EXECS AVAILABLE

VMFASM

The VMFASM EXEC is used to update the contents of a
particular module.  It includes the facilities of the CMS
UPDATE command, and additionally, it assembles the updated
source.

The command format is:

    VMFASM module CNTRLfile

VMFASM makes use of a CNTRL file.  It reads it from the
bottom to the top.  The MACLIBs mentioned in the CNTRL
file must be GLOBALled before the Assembly takes place.

The VMFASM EXEC produces a TEXT file as output.

VMFLOAD

The VMFLOAD command uses the LOADLIST to select the
modules that are to be used when the nucleus is generated.  It
makes use of the CNTRL file which it reads from the top to the
bottom (ignoring MAC records).

The command format is:

    VMFLOAD LOADLIST CNTRLfile

Once the nucleus is generated the system can be IPLed.

VMFMAC

After MACRO or COPY files have been updated they must be
placed in a MACLIB.  This is done using the VMFMAC
command:

    VMFMAC maclib CNTRLfile

Any Assembler modules that use modified MACLIBs must be
re-assembled.

VMFPLC2

The VMFPLC2 command can be used to copy information
from a tape (PUT) to disk.  It can also be used to scan the tape.

VMSERV

The VMSERV EXEC can be used by people who do not wish
to use VMFPLC2.  The contents of the PUT are always written
to the 194 C disk.  (Be warned.)  It prints the PUT
documentation and produces a map of the layout of the tape
which it writes to the 191 disk.  The file is called SERVICE
DISKMAP.
