 Reader's letter
In my article in issue 23, Using XEDIT to display messages from REXX, I
presented a method of determining whether the EXEC was running from CMS SUBSET
using the 'storage()' function.  This is unnecessarily complicated at current
release levels.  With VM/SP 4, REXX has a function which supplies the state of
the SUBSET flag directly as a truth value.  The code for conditionally using
XEDIT to issue an error message should be:
     "SUBCOM XEDIT"
     if rc = 0 & Â¬cmsflag("SUBSET")
     then address "XEDIT" "EMSG This is an Error Message.";
     else say "This is an Error Message.";
Now that REXX has been identified as the procedures language for SAA, and the
OS/2 and MVS/TSO REXX has been announced, it's time for REXX enthusiasts to
begin writing code that is as portable as possible.  A call to 'storage()' will
be honoured anywhere, and give nonsense results in non-CMS environments.  A call
to 'cmsflag()' will fail with a meaningful error message wherever the function
is not implemented, making it much easier to debug ported code.
