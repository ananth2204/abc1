The book is designed as a complete beginner's guide to using
XEDIT.  Its introductory section includes such topics as keyboard
layout and how to log-on to the system.  The second section
covers almost all the information that someone who is making
regular use of XEDIT needs to know.  The third section covers
what the author calls 'the advanced XEDIT features', and these
include changing the look and feel of XEDIT, spilt screen editing,
and writing XEDIT macros.

The text assumes that the reader has almost no knowledge of
XEDIT and, using examples, builds up information a block at a
time.  Each chapter ends with a list of new terminology
introduced, and a statement of the objectives of that chapter.  This
helps the new user get to grips with the information.

The information presented is thorough and easy to follow, either
working with it at a terminal or just following the illustrations
supplied in the book.  There is probably little in it that regular and
experienced users would not have come across before.  However,
for the novice user this book would definitely be very helpful,
especially if they had no other source of accurate information.
For other users it would make a very useful reference manual.
