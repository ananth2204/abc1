Tape sharing mods for VM/ESA

In our installation we have two CPUs, each running VM with
several VSE guests. In order to share the tape and cartridge
drives between the VSE virtual machines we use DYNAM/T,
whose catalog keeps track of drive usage at all times.
DYNAM/T also allows automatic volume recognition by
scanning all free drives, when a mount is needed, to find the
necessary scratch tape or the desired volume.

There are two problems associated with this environment:

o      If a virtual machine detaches a drive, the drive is unloaded

o      If a drive is ASSIGNed, it cannot be used by a different
      machine from the one issuing the ASSIGN.

Both of these problems can lead to the situation where a virtual
machine attempting to use a drive currently attached will be
unable to do so. In many VSE jobs this can be catastrophic.
While it is possible to detach drives from a user with the
LEAVE option, this does not solve the problem. First of all,
the LEAVE option is not valid for class G users, and secondly,
a guest logging off has all devices detached, and tapes are
unloaded (no LEAVE can be applied to log-off).

The NOASSIGN option is also useful, but there is always the
danger of a drive being attached without the option. This will
prevent all I/O to the drive by VSE on the other CPU.

In the VM/SP (and HPO) environments we used in the past, I
applied local mods to prevent the unload of detached drives and
the ASSIGN of on-line drives. In ESA, the ASSIGN support is
much clearer, not having been added as an afterthought as it
was in SP. VM/ESA logic allows a simple one line mod to
solve each of these problems, with minimal impact to the
system. Basically, the mods cause VM to assume that the
LEAVE option was specified on every detach (including at log-
off), and the NOASSIGN option was specified on every attach.

Module HCPATD performs the attach of a tape or cartridge
drive to a virtual machine. In this module there is a TM (Test
under Mask) that checks the bit signifying NOASSIGN.
Inserting another TM with the known result of CC=3 ensures
that all drives are not assigned.

Module HCPDTD performs the detach of a tape or cartridge
drive from a virtual machine. In this module there is a
conditional branch when LEAVE is specified. By inserting an
unconditional branch here, LEAVE is always in effect.
