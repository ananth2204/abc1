Shared CMS file directories

One of the best and most overlooked performance enhancements
of the CMS portion of VM/SP Release 5 is the SAVEFD
command.  SAVEFD is an abbreviation of 'saved file directories'.

The SAVEFD command allows you to place the directory of a
CMS mini-disk in a DCSS.  Any user who accesses the disk read
only will have access to this shared directory and will not
maintain a copy within their virtual machine.  This will reduce
the user's working set and, in turn, the system paging.  The
details of how to implement shared file directories are in the IBM
publication CMS for Systems Programming, SC24-5286.

Good candidates for shared file directories are CMS mini-disks
accessed by many users on a read-only basis.  Preferably, the
disks should not be changed regularly because when the disk is
changed you must issue the SAVEFD SAVE command.

SAVEFD does not work on conventional data format (CDF)
disks, which are mini-disks formatted with 800-byte blocks.
SAVEFD requires extended data format (EDF) disks, which are
mini-disks formatted with any of the other block sizes.  Also,
SAVEFD is a pure performance enhancement and has nothing to
do with shared CMS disks, which were introduced in VM/SP
Release 6.

I set up shared file directories for eight CMS mini-disks, which
are accessed by all of our 400 CMS users.  Paging rates declined
from averages of 50 pages per second to 15 pages per second on
our 32MB 3081K.  The result of this was consistently excellent
response times instead of occasional poor response times.
