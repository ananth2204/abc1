Do I need VM/ESA?

The 5 September announcement of VM/ESA heralds a new age
in the on-going history of the VM operating system.  The
questions that MIS directors at many sites must be asking
themselves are what advantages does VM/ESA offer them;
what upheavals is its installation going to cause; and do they
need to install it?

VM/ESA is meant as a replacement for all previous VM
systems.  It combines the facilities that are available with
VM/SP but not with VM/XA (such as SFS) with facilities that
are available with VM/XA but not VM/SP (such as 31-bit
addressing).

However any site planning to migrate to VM/ESA will find the
path a long and complex one.  VM/ESA Version 1.1.0 comes
in two versions.  There is a 370-mode version, which is
considered by many to be a new version of VM/SP Version 6.
So it could be thought of as VM/SP Version 7, or perhaps
Version 6.5.  The other flavour of Version 1.1.0 is the ESA-
mode version which could be thought of as VM/XA Version 3,
or perhaps 2.5.  It is worth noting that there is no version of
ESA that directly equates to VM/SP HPO.  VM/SP sites are
meant to migrate to VM/ESA 1.1.0 370-mode, and VM/XA
sites are meant to migrate to VM/ESA 1.1.0 ESA-mode.  Users
of VM/SP HPO are meant to migrate to VM/XA first.  Figure 1
illustrates the migration paths.

The reason why users should migrate to VM/ESA 1.1.0 is so
that they are positioned to upgrade to modification 1.1.1.  It is
this version of VM/ESA that offers the true ESA facilities to
the VMer.  Probably the greatest performance improvements
that VM/ESA 1.1.1 offers is the use of VM dataspaces.
Dataspaces will hold service machines such as SQL/DS, and
may well hold others such as RACF, PSF, PVM, and VTAM.
These service machines would be available to CMS, PROFS,
SFS etc and improve their performance.  The downside to this
performance gain is that an ES/9000 processor is required.

Sites that are running VM/SP Version 5 will find the whole
migration process to be traumatic.  Sites that are currently
running Version 6 will not find the migration to be so difficult.
Sites that are running VM/SP HPO will find that they lose
facilities such as SFS when they migrate to VM/XA SP, prior
to changing to VM/ESA 1.1.0.  Probably sites with VM/SP
HPO Version 6 will consider migrating directly to
VM/ESA 1.1.0 and miss out the XA stage.  VM/XA SP sites
should find the move to VM/ESA 1.1.0 fairly straightforward.

Some points that users should consider before proceeding with
a migration are:

o      Does the new version offer any facilities that are required?

o      Is the new version likely to contain any bugs?

o      Will a new processor be required to make use of the facilities?

o      Does the migration have to occur now or can be it be postponed?

o      Is support for my present VM system likely to be withdrawn?

VM/ESA Version 1.1.0 doesn't offer any new facilities, it is
IBM's way of positioning users ready to move to 1.1.1.

Any new piece of software will have been beta tested, but bugs
are always likely when it is first released.  IBM will probably
be grateful for any users who help them to iron out the
problems.

Version 1.1.0 of VM/ESA will run on the S/370 processors,
but, in order to gain the extra facilities offered with 1.1.1, an
ES/9000 processor is required.

Would a VM/SP site want to migrate to VM/ESA?  The answer
is probably no.  In the same way that IBM failed to get the
majority of VSE sites to migrate to MVS, they will probably
fail to get VM/SP users to move to VM/ESA.  The reason is
obvious: VM/SP offers all the facilities that the users require,
and is probably running multiple VSE systems under it which
are performing the majority of the work done at that site.  It is
most likely that VM/SP sites would migrate if they were
running out of real storage or channels, and did not want to
move to the dead-end product VM/SP HPO.  VM/SP sites are
constrained to 16MB of real storage; however, products such as
Software Pursuits' VM/XRM will overcome this restriction.

A site with VM/SP HPO or VM/XA should start to think about
the move.  Because of the large VM/SP user base it is likely
that support for it will continue longer than IBM would like.
However, it should be borne in mind that it is a stabilized
system.  Support for VM/SP HPO is more likely to be
withdrawn, and support for VM/XA will probably go sooner
than HPO.

Therefore, unless a site is at the limit of what its VM operating
system can offer, or is desperate for the new facilities available
with VM/ESA Version 1.1.1 and wants to be positioned to
install it as soon as it becomes available (supposedly December
1991), it seems to be more prudent to put off the migration for
as long as possible.
