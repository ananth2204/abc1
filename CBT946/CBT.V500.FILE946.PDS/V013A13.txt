In the July issue we published an article entitled EXECSCRN.  Unfortunately it
included an error on page 9 following the SCAN8 label.  The correct code should
read:

SCAN8    LA    R3,0(,R2)              RESTART POINT
         SR    R2,R1                  GET BUFFER SIZE
         ST    R2,SHVBUFL             AND SAVE IT

We apologise for any inconvenience caused.
