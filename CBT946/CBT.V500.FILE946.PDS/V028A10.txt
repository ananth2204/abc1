 Reader's letter
I have discovered a bug in the REXDUMP program in issue 19 of VM Update.  The
line which reads 'RDTERM JUNK' should be modified to read:
     RDTERM JUNK,EDIT=PHYS,LENGTH=1
If it is not, the length defaults to 130, and pressing ENTER overwrites the
first variable printed on each screen (the PRLINE declaration).
