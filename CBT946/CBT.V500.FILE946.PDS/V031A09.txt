Reader's letter

The XT EXEC in the December issue of VM Update brought to
light a frustrating problem which I had encountered many times:
trying to figure out why the changes I made to an EXEC didn't
change anything, only to realise that an old version was loaded in
storage.  However, I solved the problem more generically by
putting the following statements into my PROFILE XEDIT:
         'Extract /Fname/Ftype'
         if ftype.1=EXEC then
           do
             'Execstat 'fname.1' Exec'
             If rc=0 then
           end
You may think that the same should be done for XEDIT macros in
storage but it's unnecessary.  When a macro is edited, it is
automatically dropped from storage.  I can't find this 'feature'
documented anywhere but it sure does occur!
