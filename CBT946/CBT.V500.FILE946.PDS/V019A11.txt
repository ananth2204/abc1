 Performance hints and tips
It has been estimated that about 60% of VM users have VSE installed.  A Xephon
survey found that just under 10% of VM sites said that they had installed VM so
that they could carry out conversion from one operating system to another
(typically from VSE to MVS).  Many sites, apparently, are carrying out this
conversion solely because of technical limitations of the VSE environment.  It
is worth noting that third party software can be used to put off the need for
conversion for perhaps a year or two. For example, with multiple VSE systems,
its method of lock-file management has been a cause of much criticism.  VSE will
create multiple I/Os to disk each  time a user attempts to access a record.  The
lock-file, which resides on shared DASD, controls access to all records, and a
request for a record will cause VSE to generate an instruction to the lock file
to retrieve the record.  The record is then locked.  Any further attempts to
access that record will be rejected by the lock-file and a short wait follows
before VSE can try again.  Heavy contention leads to frequent waits and this can
be compounded by the lock-file reporting false lock conditions.  This is due to
the poor hashing technique used.  Products that can help to overcome this
problem include:

y    Extend/VSE from Goal Systems.
y    Softkey from Jeyco.
y    Vlock/VM from BMS Computer Inc.
y    Cache Magic LF from SDI.

Another interesting development comes from Pete Clark at Olan Mills in
Chattanooga, Tennesse, USA.  He has developed a patch which he is prepared to
share with other interested VSE users.  This patch increases the usual 40MB
virtual memory space limitation to 128MB, and increases the number of available
address spaces from three to eight.  So far, it is claimed that over 160 users
have made the modification to their operating system.
