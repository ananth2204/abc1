 Using XEDIT to display messages from REXX
XEDIT macros included in an EXEC - revisited, in issue 10 of VM Update,
discussed the technique of writing messages using XEDIT MSG/EMSG if an XEDIT
session was active, and SAY otherwise:
     "SUBCOM XEDIT";
     if rc=0
     then address "XEDIT" "MSG This is a Message.";
     else say "This is a Message.";
This allows an EXEC to leave the screen formatted by XEDIT when called from
XEDIT, but also to fit into a non-XEDIT environment.  It is most effective when
the XEDIT session can display multiple messages, so that XEDIT doesn't force the
screen into CP mode and write the messages line by line, eg:
     SET MSGLINE ON 2 15 OVERLAY
The technique has two weaknesses though, and they both relate to when the line
will be displayed.  A message written with SAY will be displayed immediately
(unless the screen is in MORE or HOLDING status).  A message written using XEDIT
MSG will be displayed next time XEDIT comes to refresh the screen.
CMS SUBSET
In the first case, the user has entered CMS SUBSET from XEDIT with the 'CMS'
subcommand.  SUBCOM XEDIT recognises an XEDIT session out there, so XEDIT MSG
will be used and the display will be delayed until he RETURNs from SUBSET.  This
is particularly annoying with error messages:  the EXEC completes with a non-
zero return code but gives the user no other information as to why it failed.
Use the following method for EXECs to issue error messages via XEDIT:
     "SUBCOM XEDIT";
     if rc = 0 & bitand(storage("5E9"),'01'x) = '00'x;
     then address "XEDIT" "EMSG This is an Error Message.";
     else say "This is an Error Message.";
The extra test is for the 'Subset Active' flag in NUCON.  It has been that value
at that address since VM/370 Release 1;  it won't move in the near future.
PROGRESS REPORTS
In the second case, a long-running EXEC periodically issues messages to assure
the user that the system has not died.  When XEDIT calls an EXEC directly, it
will display the updated screen only when the entire command line has been
processed.  The usefulness of a progress report is lost if it is delayed until
the EXEC has completed.  Use the XEDIT REFRESH subcommand to force an update of
the screen display:
     address "XEDIT" "MSG This is a Progress Report.";
     address "XEDIT" "REFRESH";
Using these techniques should help prevent the 'unexpected behaviours' that
reduce user confidence.
