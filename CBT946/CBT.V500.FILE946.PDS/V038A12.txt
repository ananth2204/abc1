Enhancement

Enrique Garcia Dulanto from Computo SA in Peru wrote with a
correction to his article entitled Directory maintenance on-line
printed in the June 1989 issue.  In the VMDIRECT EXEC on
page 5 the code could be improved to read:

    'ACCESS 191 A'
    PUSH 'VMDIRECT NOINDEX'
    RETURN

This reduces the overhead involved in using the system because an
index is no longer created whenever a user requests a service from
the VMDIRECT virtual machine.
