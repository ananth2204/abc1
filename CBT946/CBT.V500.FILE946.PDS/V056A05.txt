Digital clock for the XEDIT screen

The XCLOCK EXEC shows a digital 'clock' in the upper right-
hand corner of the XEDIT screen.  The clock is actually taken
from the STATUS window, which is normally displayed at the
bottom of the screen when fullscreen CMS is set on.  Please
note, however, that the XCLOCK EXEC does not require
fullscreen CMS to be set on.  The EXEC takes advantage of
the fact that XEDIT uses CMS Session Services regardless of
whether fullscreen CMS is set on or off.

The clock is updated by CMS Session Services.  By changing
the position, seconds can be displayed in addition to hours and
minutes.  Similarly, the clock's position can be moved to
accommodate 3278 Model 5 screens in wide-screen mode.  The
colour of the clock can be specified as an argument.
Although the XCLOCK EXEC will run on all releases of CMS
from Release 5 onwards, the example shown conforms to the
restructured CMS Session Services commands introduced by
APARs VM35846 (for VM/SP) and VM35847 (for VM/XA SP).
