 CALC EXEC
This is one of the shortest useful programs I've seen.  CALC just executes
whatever arguments you give it as a REXX command, displaying the result.
Initially, it might not sound particularly useful, but if you know the REXX
functions right off the top of your head it can save you a lot of little
specialised EXECs.  I used to have, for example, EXECs to do four-function
maths, hex conversions, and EBCDIC table look-up.  All those functions are now
included in one place, along with much more.
CALC EXEC
Arg Cmdline
Interpret Say Cmdline
Exit 0;
