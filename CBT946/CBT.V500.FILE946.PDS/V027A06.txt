 Console spool utility
The following is an EXEC that we find handy to control VM console spooling
functions.  This EXEC can be invoked with one of eight different parameters to
provide everything from starting and stopping your console spooling, XEDITing
the saved console, to printing it out, and more.  Following is a description of
each parameter and its function:
y    START - this starts spooling of the console to yourself in class T.  If 'N'
is also specified, the NOTERM option is also used. (No console output is shown
to the user.)
y    STOP - stop console spooling and place the console log in the reader as a
class T reader file.
y    READ - read a previously 'STOP'ed console file from your reader and place
it into a CMS file named CONS LIST A.
y    LOOK - XEDIT the CONS LIST A file containing your console logs.
y    GET - Combines the functions of STOP, READ, and LOOK all into one function.
Use this after 'START'ing your console to STOP your spooling, READ in the
console reader file, and place you in XEDIT mode of the CONS LIST A file.
y    PURGE - stop spooling and purge the created console reader file.
y    ERASE - erase the CONS LIST A file.
y    PRINT - print your CONS LIST A to wherever your printer is spooled.
This EXEC is very useful when testing other EXECs.  Simply turn on the TRACE in
the EXEC to be tested, and issue a CONS START to begin spooling.  You can then
run your EXEC, and when finished, issue a CONS GET to stop your spooling, and
place you in XEDIT mode of the CONS LIST file.  You can then review the
execution of your tested EXEC.
