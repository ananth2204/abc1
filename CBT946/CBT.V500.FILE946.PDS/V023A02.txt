 Size of largest contiguous free storage area
If you need in your EXEC the storage size that is available XDISTOR can help
you.
XDISTOR returns in register 15 the length of the largest piece of contiguous
free storage rounded down in kilobytes.
Because register 15 is used to fill the return code variable in EXEC2 or REXX it
is easy to obtain the value, for example:
     &TRACE OFF
     XDISTOR
     &TYPE Largest free storage area is &RC k.
     &EXIT 0
