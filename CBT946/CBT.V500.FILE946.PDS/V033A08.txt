Wish list

The following is a wish list for a future release of VM:

%   One single version of VM, not five different ones.

%   One single set of commands for operators to learn and use.
    All the commands would work.

%   No more mini-disks.  This would reduce the amount of
    duplication and space wastage that occurs.  It would also
    remove a security problem that exists where a new mini-disk
    can be allocated at the same location as an existing one.

%   All files should be listed in a catalog, including unloaded and
    archived files.

%   VSAM files should be directly available to VM - no longer
    requiring VSE/VSAM.

%   Faster channel speeds should be available so that 3380s could
    be filled with active files without contention making
    performance figures so appalling.

%   VTAM should run directly under VM and the requirement for
    GCS should be removed.

%   SNA/SDLC networks should be standard.

%   A full-function CICS system should be available.

%   A simplified directory should be installed and there should be
    an easy way to update it.

%   There should be much better security.

%   Something like JES3 should be available to run production
    batch jobs.

%   System software should be available that automatically
    attaches and detaches tape drives to and from virtual
    machines.

Editor's note: we would be interested to see any other wish lists
people might have.
