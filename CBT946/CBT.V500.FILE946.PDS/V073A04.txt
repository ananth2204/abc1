VM/ESA - practical migration issues


SYSTEM OVERVIEW

The 370 feature of VM/ESA is the logical successor to VM/SP.
The similarity stems from the use of a derivative of the VM/SP
Release 6 Control Program (CP) to allow it to run on
System/370 hardware and provide 370-mode (only) virtual
machines. It is supported on all processors that are supported
by VM/SP Release 6.

There is no equivalent to VM/SP HPO in VM/ESA-370; IBM
expects that the high-end user will wish to migrate to the ESA
feature of VM/ESA as he moves to hardware capable of
running it. However, certain enhancements from HPO have
been moved into VM/ESA-370 to allow it to exploit a wider
range of platforms.

The consequences of this should be noted. Migration to
VM/ESA-370 from VM/SP Release 6 is straightforward
because its CP and CMS components, like the rest of the
system, are derived directly from the equivalent Release 6
components.

Migration from earlier releases of VM/SP involves the same
migration problems as migration to VM/SP Release 6 (caused
by the radically restructured version of CMS in that release,
which was derived from the XA capable CMS in VM/XA SP).

The ESA feature of VM/ESA is a derivative of, and the natural
successor to, VM/XA SP Release 2.1. Migration from that
release is therefore very straightforward. Release 1.0 for
VM/ESA-ESA has now been succeeded by Release 1.1, with
significant additional functionality. VM/ESA-ESA is the only
VM system which IBM is now developing - there will be no
more releases of VM/ESA-370, VM/SP, HPO, or VM/XA SP.

The HPO (Release 5 or Release 6) user has no direct migration
path to VM/ESA. Instead, he has three choices:

o      Migrate to VM/ESA-ESA, if he has suitable hardware.

o      Migrate to VM/ESA-370, if the limited support for HPO it
      offers is sufficient.

o      Remain on VM/SP Release 5 or 6 with HPO.

As VM/SP Release 6 is the last release of the VM/SP product,
IBM will maintain support for it until the majority of its user
have migrated to VM/ESA - and this is likely to take several
years. However, today's market driven IBM is very conscious
of the cost of providing this support for customers who have
rejected their development direction for VM, so support will be
provided only for a finite period.

HPO 6 will continue to be supported for the same reasons.
However, since HPO 6 was released with some qualifications
by IBM, the combination of VM/SP Release 5 and HPO is also
likely to continue to be supported for a reasonable period.
However, support for VM/SP 5 without HPO will be dropped
earlier as there is a clear successor release.

The VM/XA SP user is not expected to be a candidate for
VM/ESA-370 (and such a migration would probably only make
sense in a very limited number of cases). Such users will
naturally migrate to VM/ESA-ESA, and find that the platform
this gives them performs better, is more stable and more
functional, and often costs less. VM/XA SP support will
therefore not need to be offered for long.

Finally, it must be emphasized that IBM's current mainframe
product line (the ES/9000 and beyond) now includes only
hardware capable of running VM/ESA-ESA (and indeed has
done so since 1990). IBM has clearly stated that VM/ESA-370
Release 1 is the last release of VM for the pure System/370
architecture - all future releases of VM/ESA will be of the
ESA feature only.

To summarize, then, VM/ESA-370 provides a final release of
VM for the 370 architecture and is targeted primarily at
existing users of 9370 and 4381 (non-ESA) systems. A few
enhancements from HPO are provided, but it is probably not a
viable path for the majority of HPO users. Users of the 3080
product line can also use VM/ESA-370 in a 370-mode logical
partition, but, for large systems, HPO may be a more desirable
option.

Users of 3090s and ES/9000s are recommended to use
VM/ESA-ESA instead. However VM/ESA-370 is supported on
3090s and ES/9000s in a logical partition, and so could perhaps
be used, in the short term, for a small VM population running
alongside VSE or MVS.

VM/ESA-ESA feature is a major step towards IBM's goal of a
single VM. This has been achieved by using as many common
components between the 370 and ESA lines as is practical
without significant additional effort. It also unifies the previous
pricing discrepancy between VM/SP and VM/XA SP by
introducing a single, graduated charging scheme for both the
370 and ESA features. Ultimately the 'single VM' goal will be
achieved by VM/ESA-ESA alone. This will run on every IBM
hardware platform from the entry level, rack-mounted ES/9000
to the top of the range, multi-processor, water-cooled models.


COMMON VM/ESA FEATURES

Certain components of the VM/ESA Release 1.0 370 feature
are identical to components in the VM/ESA Release 1.0 ESA
feature. These are:

o      CMS
o      REXX
o      TSAF
o      AVS
o      VMSES.

Because these are common components, identical code is
shipped for them on the VM/ESA-370 and VM/ESA-ESA
tapes.

The CMS component is known as CMS Level 7 (CMS 7), and
is a derivative of the VM/SP Release 6 CMS component
(which is itself a derivative of the VM/XA SP Release 2 CMS
component). VM/ESA-ESA Release 1.1 contains the next
release of CMS beyond this system, known as CMS 8.

The REXX component is now delivered and serviced
separately from the CMS component, but is derived from
REXX in VM/SP Release 6 CMS.

TSAF is part of the APPC/VM support in VM Release 5 and
above. It was not previously available on VM/XA SP and is
carried over as a common component to both of the VM/ESA
features.

APPC/VM VTAM Support (AVS) is a VTAM application
which links local APPC/VM applications to other APPC
applications anywhere in the SNA network, whether they are
running on VM systems or other platforms (eg AS/400,
OS/2EE, or AIX). This component was already part of VM/SP
Release 6 and, like TSAF, has been made a common
component of both VM/ESA features.

The last component is a new version of the VM service
procedure known as SES, an acronym whose meaning has
varied over the years. It is now called VMSES (or VMSES/E
in VM/ESA-ESA 1.1 where it is further enhanced), and has
been significantly enhanced as well as becoming a separately
maintained component which is common to the two features.

There are obvious benefits for both IBM and its customers in
having single, common components like these: there is only
one system to service, many common manuals can be used,
and the migration from one system to the other is greatly eased.
However, since the 370 feature is functionally stabilized while
the ESA feature will be enhanced, this commonality will
effectively have only a very short lifetime. After that, there
will be only one system to worry about.


DISTINCT VM/ESA FEATURES

Those components which are not common to the VM/ESA 370
and ESA features are, of course, shipped as different code for
each platform, and serviced separately. They are:

o      CP
o      IPCS/DVF
o      GCS.

The major component which differs between the 370 and ESA
features is, of course, the Control Program. The VM/ESA-370
CP is derived directly from the VM/SP Release 6 CP
component, with some enhancements from HPO, whereas the
ESA feature is derived from VM/XA SP 2.1.

The CP in the 370 feature is based on the VM/SP CP which
used IPCS as its diagnosis and problem management tool,
whereas in the ESA feature it is based on the VM/XA SP CP
which had DVF for diagnosis. These two separate products are
used in the two different features of VM/ESA to provide
analysis of stand-alone, CP, CMS, and service virtual machine
dumps, and analysis of captured trace table data.

In order to support the enhanced 31-bit capabilities of the latest
releases of VTAM, a new version of the GCS was developed
for VM/ESA-ESA. However, this support was not made
downward compatible, and so the VM/SP Release 6 GCS
implementation is carried over into VM/ESA-370. The
availability of 31-bit VTAM on VM/ESA-ESA is a major boost
for customers with a storage constrained VTAM system.

The DFSMS/VM storage management product, the platform
for System Managed Storage in VM, has been integrated into
VM/ESA-ESA Release 1.1 (at the DFSMS/VM Release 1.1
level, now re-christened Functional Level 210). As an interim
measure for VM/ESA-370 customers, the existing DFSMS/VM
product, although not part of VM/ESA-370, becomes a no-
charge feature of Release 1.0.

IPF, which provides FLIST, BROWSE, etc to VM/SP,
continues to be available for VM/ESA-370 (although you must
ensure that the appropriate IPF/XA version is ordered to work
with the 32-bit capable CMS in VM/SP 6 and VM/ESA). On
the other hand, VM/ESA-ESA now has a CMS Utilities feature
which delivers these capabilities.

Other VM/SP Release 6 products and accessories, such as IPF,
are available as add-on products to ESA-370 in exactly the
same way as for VM/SP, although care must be taken to ensure
that appropriate service levels are installed before the migration
is attempted. Almost all IBM and third-party products now
support both VM/ESA features.


VM/ESA ENHANCEMENTS

For those already familiar with VM/SP Release 6, this section
summarizes the enhancements made in VM/ESA-370. It then
summarizes the enhancements in CMS 7 (relative to both
VM/SP and VM/XA SP). Finally, the new function in
VM/ESA-ESA Release 1.1 is discussed.

The first stop for the VM/SP user migrating to VM/ESA must
be the Conversion Notebook (in its 370 or ESA form). This
provides an excellent summary of all incompatible and
upwardly compatible changes between the different releases of
VM/SP, VM/XA SP, VM/ESA-370, and VM/ESA-ESA.

CP enhancements

One area of enhancement to VM/ESA-370 is the CP function
introduced from HPO. This includes:

o      Support for up to 64MB of real storage (rather than 16).
o      Support for 32 channels.
o      Support for 4-digit device addresses.

This support (particularly the additional real storage) will be
useful to 4381 users who need an expansion path but not the
other capabilities of HPO. It may also be desirable to
customers who went to HPO only for this support, but it should
not be viewed as a complete replacement for the capabilities of HPO.

Dynamic reconfiguration

The most useful functional enhancement to the CP component
of VM/ESA-370 is in the area of dynamic reconfiguration.
Three elements of system configuration which previously
required the regeneration of CP and re-IPL of VM can now be
dynamically changed without a re-IPL:

o      DMKSYS - system configuration (including time zone and
      system identifier).

o      DMKBOX - the log-on banner screen.

o      DMKSNT - shared segment definitions.

This support uses the override capability already present in
VM/SP (for user command class restructuring) to store in CP
the tables containing the installation-defined values for this
data. Now, instead of performing the traditional assembly of a
configuration file containing the data, followed by a CP system
generation and a VM IPL, the system areas can be updated
directly on the live system.

For example, a file SYSTEM OVERRIDE could be created
containing:

:Imbed.CMD OVERRIDE *          /* Command overrides      */
:Imbed.BOX OVERRIDE *          /* Logo override          */
:Imbed.SNT OVERRIDE *          /* SNT  override          */
:Imbed.SYSPARM OVERRIDE *      /* SYSPARM overrides file */

This defines four subsidiary override files containing the
appropriate data.

The first, CMD OVERRIDE, provides the same function as the
current override command for user class restructuring (but with
a different file format).

The SYSPARM OVERRIDE file replaces some (but not all) of
the fields in DMKSYS and might contain:

:System.Default                /* Default system time zone     */
   TimeZone=GMT Offset=East(0)    /* Winter Time Zone          */
/* TimeZone=BST Offset=East(1)       British Summer Time       */
:System.Unknown                /* System ID for unknown CPUIDS */
   Identifier=VM.DEV
:System.(4381)10630            /* System ID for 4381           */
   Identifier=STLRDG1
:System.(9375)00567            /* System ID for 9375           */
   Identifier=STLRDG2

This says that the current time zone is called GMT and is offset
0 from Greenwich Mean Time. By commenting out the GMT
setting instead of the BST one and placing this file on-line, the
time zone can be changed at the start of daylight saving time
each year without an IPL.

In addition, the file defines the system identifier (displayed in
the status area of CP screens, for example). To allow multiple
systems to be maintained from a single file, different identifiers
may be used (as shown) for different CPU models and
identifiers.

The BOX OVERRIDE file can contain the old DMKBOX data
for the log-on screen:

:Logo.Screen                   /* Normal screen logo              */
   Line=Left( C'VV     VV MM     MM      //                       ')
   Line=Left( C'VV     VV MMM   MMM     //                        ')
   Line=Left( C' VV   VV  MMMM MMMM    //                         ')
   Line=Left( C'  VV VV   MM MMM MM   //                          ')
   Line=Left( C'   VVV    MM  M  MM  // EEEEEEEE  SSSSSSS    A    ')
   Line=Left( C'    V     MM     MM //  EE       SS    SS    A    ')
   Line=Left( C'                   //   EEEEE     SSS       A A   ')
   Line=Left( C'                  //    EEEEE        SSS   AAAAA  ')
   Line=Left( C'  Soft-Switch    //     EE       SS    SS AA   AA ')
   Line=Left( C'    Limited     //      EEEEEEEE SSSSSSS  A     A ')
   Width=50
:Logo.Input                    /* Normal screen logo - input area */
LINE=LEFT(X'1DF8', C'Fill in your USERID and PASSWORD and press ENTER')
LINE=LEFT(X'1DF8', C'(Your password will not appear when you type it)')
   UserID='USERID   ===>'
   Password='PASSWORD ===>'
   Command='COMMAND  ===>'

In addition to this data, the data to be used for a minimal log-
on screen (when the full screen will not fit) and for the printer
logo is defined in this file.

Finally, the SNT OVERRIDE file replaces DMKSNT:

:DefSys.CMS                     /* Definition for CMS release 7 */
     Volume=SSWD00                   /* Replaces old SYSVOL value  */
     SaveLoc=9404                    /* Replaces old SYSSTRT value */
     PageList=(0-13,16-34,3584-4095) /* Replaces old SYSPGNM value */
     PageCount=545                   /* Replaces old SYSPGCT value */
     SegList=(224-255)               /* Replaces old SYSHRSG value */
     Size=256K                       /* Replaces old SYSSIZE value */
     IPLAddr=IGNORE                  /* Replaces old VSYSADR value */
     ParmRegs=(0,15)                 /* Replaces old PARMRGS value */
     Family=CMS-7
     Family=CMSVSAM-7
     Family=CMS-SFSVM-7

This example shows only the shared segment definition for the
CMS shared segment, but in real life it would be followed by
the other definitions for all of the other shared segments
required.

When performing a migration to VM/ESA-370, the
MIGROVRD EXEC migration tool can be used to create these
override files from existing DMKSNT, DMKBOX, and
DMKSYS files. It also converts any existing user class
restructuring files to the new override file format required for
CMD OVERRIDE. Remember that you will need to define a
larger override area than before.

These enhancements provide real productivity improvements
for the systems programmer, and represent a serious step
towards continuous operations of VM systems (although, of
course, the significant area of DMKRIO still needs to be
addressed).

Other enhancements

The various other enhancements to CP in VM/ESA-370 are
minor, but the following specific points should be noted:

o      A new user-id, NEWMAINT (or whatever name you
      decide to use), can be used to install the VM system. This
      allows the new system to be installed without impacting
      the current production system maintained from MAINT.

      You may subsequently rename your NEWMAINT user-id
      to MAINT in the directory, but you will need to use the
      SFSTRANS EXEC shipped with CMS on VM/ESA-370 to
      transfer ownership of any source installed in SFS to the
      new user-id.

o      Spool files should migrate automatically from VM/SP
      Release 6 to VM/ESA-370, but you would be advised to
      use SPTAPE to back-up the files immediately before
      IPLing the new system - just in case.

o      Various defaults and limits have changed. The default
      MAXCONN value for a user-id has been raised from 4 to
      16 to reflect the increased number of IUCV and APPC/VM
      sessions used by the average virtual machine. The
      maximum value of the IUCV MSGLIMIT has been raised
      from 255 to 65,535, and this new upper limit is now the
      default for *MSG.

o      A Diagnose 0 will return a system name of VM/ESA
      (rather than VM/SP), and the licensed program bit map
      returned will include a new bit to indicate VM/ESA
      Release 1.

o      A new reserved password, AUTOONLY, may be specified
      in the directory for a user-id which cannot be logged on
      from a terminal.

o      The following command response is returned:

      query cplevel
      VM/ESA Release 1, Service Level 000 - 370 feature
      Generated at 10/16/90 11:45:00 GMT
      IPL at 04/17/91 14:04:38 BST

New CMS 7 features

The version of CMS shipped with VM/ESA is the logical
successor to the CMS in VM/SP Release 6, and is generally
known as CMS 7. VM/XA SP users need to be aware of the
enhancements already made available in VM/SP Release 6, as
well as the new CMS 7 features discussed here. As you can see
below, the fact that different versions of VM are running the
same CMS component has caused some changes in interface:

      query cmslevel
      CMS Level 7, Service Level 000

Special care must be taken with EXECs which parse the output
of this command since (as shown above) the service level is
returned as 000, rather than, say, 600 as the case with the first
service level for VM/SP Release 6.

The following EXEC shows one mechanism which can be used
to discover which release of CMS is currently running (it uses
an address in the CMS nucleus which contains the current CMS
release level). Note that this is not a programming interface;
there is no defined programming interface which will return
this information to an EXEC!

/* CMSLEVEL - Function to return current CMS Release             */
/* ========   --------------------------------------             */
/*                                                               */
/* Returns: As the RESULT of a REXX call, or RC of a command     */
/*        0 for VM/370 (with/without BSEPP/SEPP)                 */
/*      1-4 for VM/SP CMS Release 1 to Release 4                 */
/*        5 for VM/SP CMS Release 5                              */
/*      5.5 for VM/SP CMS Release 5.5, 5.6 (with fix)            */
/*        6 for VM/SP CMS Release 6                              */
/*        7 for VM/ESA-370 1.0 CMS Release 7 (& 5.6 without fix) */
trace Normal
signal on novalue
address command
CMSLevel = "C2D"("STORAGE"('E5D', 1))  /* See CMSLEVEL Macro for */
                                       /*     documented values  */
if CMSLevel < 3 then CMSLevel = 0
else if CMSLevel < 8 then CMSLevel = CMSLevel - 2
else if CMSLevel = 8 then CMSLevel = 5.5
else CMSLevel = CMSLevel - 3
 return CMSLevel

Note that VM/XA SP Release 2.1 originally returned the wrong
value for the CMS level. A PTF has been issued to fix this
problem, and the above EXEC functions correctly only if that
PTF has been applied.

The main alternative to this mechanism (for REXX code) is to
parse the output of the QUERY CMSLEVEL command. If you
adopt this approach, ensure that you pick up the third token of
the output (ignoring the values of the first two), remove the
trailing comma, and use the remaining value as the release
level. Other ways of parsing the command output may not
always work.

The only defined interface to obtain this value is to issue the
QUERY CMSLEVEL command, and examine the result
returned in bits 8-15 of Register 1 by comparing them with the
values defined in the CMSLEVEL macro. However this
approach does require you to write an Assembler program. You
will also need to adopt some strategy to suppress the generation
of the release level message (either using the HT flag, or
stacking the response and then discarding it).

Particular care should be taken in ensuring that code which
checks for the current CP or CMS release level checks the
component appropriate to the function being performed. This
means using a technique such as that described above when
testing for the availability of CMS facilities, and one like
Diagnose 0 (from REXX or Assembler) when checking the
availability of CP facilities. This will become more critical in
future - IBM has now responded to customer pressure and is
supporting mixed CP and CMS release level components for
the first time (from VM/ESA-ESA Release 1.1).

Shared File Systems enhancements

For the VM/XA SP user, the Shared File System (SFS) is, of
course, entirely new. The VM/SP Release 6 user already has a
number of SFS SPEs, including the maintenance of a last read
date, a default of read-only when accessing other users'
directories, and commit without close support. Some major
enhancements to the SFS are also provided in VM/ESA.

The biggest architectural change is a new attribute for shared
file system directories, called directory controlled (or
DIRCONTROL) directories. The old type of directories are
now called file controlled (FILECONTROL) directories.
Directory controlled directories behave in a more 'mini-disk
like' manner than file controlled directories. For example:

o      Only one user can access them in write mode at any one time.

o      Multiple users may access the directory in read mode
      (concurrently with one user in write mode).

o      Updated files are not seen by the user until the directory is
      re-accessed (and existing files will remain visible for the
      same period).

o      Users authorized to read/write to the directory
      (DIRREAD/DIRWRITE) can read/write to all files in the
      directory (including those which have yet to be created).

o      If files are given the INPLACE attribute, changes made to
      their content will be returned to a read-only user next time
      the appropriate file blocks are read. For all other files, the
      new data will not be seen until the directory is re-accessed.

It is important to understand that a directory can be
dynamically changed between DIRCONTROL and
FILECONTROL status, providing no one else is using it.

For the traditional file controlled directories, a new pair of
attributes (NEWREAD and NEWWRITE) are introduced,
enabling users to be automatically granted read or write
authority to any new files created in that directory. This
significantly enhances the usability of the Shared File System
for many types of application.

Although certainly useful in CMS 7, directory controlled
directories really come into their own with VM/ESA-ESA
Release 1.1 and CMS 8, because access to such directories can
be provided via a separate dataspace which is accessible read-
only to user virtual machines. This significantly improves the
performance of DIRCONTROL directories which are accessed
read-only. (This capability can be used in OfficeVision/VM
Version 1.2 for the SYSADMIN 399 disk.)

Other Shared File System enhancements

One of the most useful changes to SFS is available as an SPE
to VM/ESA-370. It offers file-level restore from filepool back-
ups. Although the restore can be performed only on a CMS 7
system, it is worth noting that it will restore individual files
from a tape created on CMS 6.

Indeed, a level of access is also provided between SFS and
users running on different levels of CMS, although it is
recommended that the users and the service virtual machines be
aligned on the same CMS level whenever possible. This may
not, of course, be practical when users on different systems are
accessing the Shared File System remotely.

An SFS filepool, which has been moved to the VM/ESA SFS,
can be migrated back to VM/SP Release 6, provided that none
of the new facilities are being used (ie any directory controlled
directories are switched back to file controlled directories, and
any NEWREAD/NEWWRITE authorities are revoked). You
must also perform an orderly shut-down of the VM-ESA
Shared File System (via a STOP command not a STOP
IMMEDIATE command) before migrating back.

If you need to use mixed levels of CMS and SFS virtual
machines, you should first check that the support you need is
offered and that all required service is applied.

MACLIB restructuring

The names of the various VM macro libraries have been
changed in VM/ESA. If you have Assembler language
programs you may use the new MACLMIG command to avoid
the need to change any of your EXECs which perform these
assemblies.

The MACLMIG command allows you to automatically
substitute one MACLIB name by another when commands
such as GLOBAL MACLIB are used. The following mapping
is performed:

DMKSP    -> DMKGPI DMKPSI DMKOM
DMKSPA   -> DMKOMA
DMKSPAT  -> DMKOMAT
DMKSPM   -> DMKOMM
DMKSPMT  -> DMKOMMT
CSISP    -> CSIGPI CSIOM
DMSSP    -> DMSGPI DMSOM
CMSLIB   -> DMSGPI DMSOM
DOSMACRO -> DMSOM
OSMACRO  -> OSMACRO OSPSI
OSMACRO1 -> MVSXA OSMACRO1
OSVSAM   -> OSVSAM
TSOMAC   -> OSMACRO OSMACRO1
IXXSP    -> IXXOM

Note that as for VM/SP, DMK is the prefix for CP, DMS for
CMS, CSI for GCS, and IXX for REXX. The suffix is used to
indicate whether the macros in a library represent a stable,
published user interface which will not change (GPI for
General-use Programming Interface), a product-sensitive
interface which may change if the internal design of a product
changes (PSI for Product-Sensitive programming Interface), or
an internal interface intended for IBM use only (OM).

Although this support will allow you to continue to use your
existing EXECs and commands without change (by calling
MACLMIG in your SYSPROF EXEC or PROFILE EXEC), it
is recommended that you correct all of the appropriate EXECs
as soon as is practical, to use the correct, new macro library
names (and to only use the MACLIBs that they really need).

Other enhancements

One significant set of enhancements in VM/ESA CMS is the
storage management system debugging tools, implemented in
the STORMAP, STDEBUG, and SUBPMAP commands.
These provide comprehensive facilities for analysing and
tracing the usage of CMS free storage, and are invaluable to
the serious CMS programmer.

REXX has also been enhanced to support the following (this
support was also shipped as an SPE to some earlier releases):

o      The ability to allow a CALL to be executed instead of a
      SIGNAL when the appropriate condition is detected:
      CALL ON ERROR/FAILURE/HALT

o      The ability to associate an alternative label with a condition
      handling routine instead of having to use the name of the
      condition which occurred:

      SIGNAL ON type NAME label
      CALL ON type NAME label

o      The ability to pass up to 20 arguments on a CALL (this
      limit used to be 10).

Support removed

Following loud demands from the user groups, IBM provided
service to VM/SP to reverse the two-word fullscreen CMS
commands introduced in VM/SP Release 5 - for example,
CLEAR WINDOW became WINDOW CLEAR. All fullscreen
CMS functions were made operands of the WINDOW,
VSCREEN, or PSCREEN commands by this support. The old
form of the commands could then be disabled via a new
command:

      SET OLDCMDS OFF

In VM/ESA, the only valid operand for OLDCMDS is OFF,
and only the new form of the fullscreen CMS commands can
be used. A conversion utility, CONV2WD EXEC, is provided
to assist in converting EXECs which use the fullscreen CMS
commands to work with the new form of the commands.

Support has also been removed from VM/ESA for the old 800-
byte block disk format retrospectively called the Conventional
Disk Format (CDF), as opposed to the Enhanced Disk Format
(EDF) introduced by the BSEPP enhancements to VM/370. All
CDF disks must be reformatted to an EDF format (ie non-800-
byte block size) before moving to VM/ESA.

Although the Conversion Notebook states that VM/ESA will
not read files which have been dumped to tape from CDF
disks, this is not an accurate restriction and it should be
possible to read such tapes. However, it is recommended that
these tapes are, nevertheless, converted (as described in the
Conversion Notebook) whenever practical.

One other function removed in VM/ESA (if anyone cares) is 7-
track tape support,

Finally, it should be noted that the DOD B1 level security
available for VM/SP Release 6 is not available for VM/ESA-
370. Users requiring B1 security should investigate the security
facilities available with VM/ESA-ESA Release 1.1 instead.

VM/ESA-ESA Release 1.1

The major enhancement in VM/ESA-ESA Release 1.1 is the
provision of CMS level access to the dataspace support of the
ESA architecture via the new XCMODE (Extended Control
Mode) virtual machines. It should be noted that XCMODE is
supported only on System/390 processors (although VM/ESA
1.1 will run, and is supported, on any ESA processor,
including 4381-9x and 3090s).

This provides a very high speed mechanism for sharing data in
memory between different virtual machines - one machine
owns the dataspace but any number may be authorized to read
it and write to it. It includes CMS support to assist applications
in using this new capability.

Dataspaces are exploited by the Shared File System, and by the
latest releases of SQL/DS and VS/FORTRAN.

A further major enhancement in ESA 1.1 is the incorporation
of the CMS Pipelines PRPQ, which offers Unix style pipeline
commands by co-routing multiple applications. This is a major
enhancement for the proficient CMS user, and compares with
REXX and XEDIT as a major productivity tool.

The integration of DFSMS/VM into the base VM system also
occurs at this level.

Minor enhancements include:

o      FORCE DISK to allow an operator to disconnect a user,
      rather than logging them off.

o      LOGON HERE, allowing an already logged on user to be
      moved between terminals - a feature which users love.

o      GIVE command to move a device (tape) to another user-id.

o      3990 Dual Copy support (in addition to Fast Write which is
      already supported).

o      Cryptographic processor support for guests.

Finally, of course, all of the features provided in VM/ESA-
ESA 1.0 which were not previously available for VM/XA SP
are offered, including teletype support, alternate nucleus, fast
warm start, and the Inter-System Facility for Communications
(ISFC), the host component used by PWSCS to provide CPI-C
conformant APPC connectivity between APPC/VM and LAN-
based applications, without going via VTAM. There is also a
Statement of Direction for VM/ESA-ESA support of FBA
DASD by the end of 1992.


INSTALLATION NOTES

The installation and maintenance process implemented by
VMSES is documented in a pair of new manuals called the
Service Guide.

Before installing any release of VM/ESA, you should check
with IBM and your third-party software suppliers on the
prerequisite release levels for all the other products you use.
IBM can provide a list of third-party products and releases
which claim support for VM/ESA. The changed system
interfaces in VM/ESA make it possible that some such
prerequisites will exist, particularly if you are migrating from a
VM/SP Release 5 system (or earlier).

The publications library has been revised, and the EXEC 2
manuals removed.

A soft-copy version of the publications is also available,
providing documentation either on-line for use with
BookManager READ/VM (and also BookManager BUILD/VM
if you wish to process the source materials), or on a CD-ROM
for use with BookManager READ/2 or BookManager
READ/DOS.

Although the new CMS Pipelines capability in VM/ESA-ESA
Release 1.1 is not incorporated into VM/ESA-370, this
function is available via a separately packaged PRPQ, which is
highly recommended to any serious VM/CMS site.


VM/ESA DIRECTIONS

The VM/ESA-370 feature could be seen, by the sentimental, as
the last true release of VM/370 - the last version of VM able to
run on a System/370 processor. Because all current and future
IBM mainframe systems will support the System/390
architecture, the system has little long-term future except as a
final resting place for the user of those processors unable to
take advantage of this new architecture, at least until they are
upgraded to the new generation of ES/9000 systems. There
seems little doubt that, as the culmination of 20 years of
evolution for VM on 370 processors, it will perform that role
admirably.

If that is the case, then VM/ESA-ESA Release 1.1 must be
seen as the first release of the new VM. It has re-emerged as a
new, focused product in a new world which is no longer
mainframe dominated, but in which the mainframe is one
(server) component in a distributed world of client-server
applications. It certainly drives VM to new levels of reliability
and performance, and provides a launch pad for the future.
