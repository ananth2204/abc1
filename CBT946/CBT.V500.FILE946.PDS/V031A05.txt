REIPL EXEC

The REIPL EXEC will invoke a re-IPL of the CMS saved system
and, optionally, allow a new machine size to be defined.
If a command line parameter is specified, it is used as the new
virtual machine size to be DEFINEd before the CP IPL command
is issued (eg, 1M, 768K, 5M etc).  The IPL command is issued
with the PARM AUTOCR, in order to bypass the first terminal
read issued by CMS.

This EXEC has been found to be very helpful for users who must
re-define their virtual machine size occasionally or when on the
phone to a user who is having trouble (since a re-IPL is sometimes
the best 'fix').
