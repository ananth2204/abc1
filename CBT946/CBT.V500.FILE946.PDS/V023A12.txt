 Performance hints and tips
There are three key areas that can cause a performance bottleneck.  These are
CPU, paging, and I/O.  The CPU bottleneck can be relieved, at great expense, by
upgrading the hardware and making more main memory available.  Paging
bottlenecks can often be self-induced and it is necessary to ensure that
sensible SET FAVOR, QDROP, RESERVE,  and SRM values are in use throughout the
day.  It can also help, but again incurs extra expense, to install high speed
paging devices.  It is also possible to reduce the amount of paging that a
particular virtual machine does by the use of saved segment areas.  I/O
bottlenecks can be relieved  by analysing disk seek activity and ensuring that
data placement reduces the bottleneck.  Another effective method of reducing I/O
bottlenecks is the duplication of data, particularly if it is 'read-only'.
Other more general improvements in performance can be made by user training and
rewriting moribund applications.
