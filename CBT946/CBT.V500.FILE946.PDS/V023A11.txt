Another way to solve the VM/VTAM problem described by Kevin Potter in issue 20
of VM Update is to make a programmable operator machine the secondary user-id
for his VTAM service machine.  The programmable operator machine can be given a
list of 'authorised' controllers in the RTABLE file.  Programmable operator will
keep an audit trail and can be coerced to return responses to requestors.

This strategy involves no fooling around with VM control blocks, no lengthy
EXECs and can be applied to other similar problems.
