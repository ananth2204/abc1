 Performance hints and tips

The Xephon Survey VM Performance in Practice asked respondents to list in order
of priority the areas that they had found to be most effective in tuning their
own systems.  The most frequently mentioned area, and the one that was given the
highest priority by most people, was paging.  The other areas that were quite
frequently mentioned, and were assigned a high priority, were:

y    I/O

y    Channel balancing
y    Proper use of FAVOR, QDROP and PRIORITY commands.
