Correction

A Popielewicz has enhanced the 'answerphone' program
published in issue 57 of VM Update so that it works even if the
reader is not empty when the BUSYNOTE EXEC is started.

The additional code should be added to the text a third of the
way down page 8, immediately before the line:

      WRITE    WRTERM 'ENTER TEXT(100 CHARACTERS)',100   MESSAGE

Add the following code:

NEXTFILE LA    5,BUFFER0            LOAD ADDRESS OF USER BUFFER
         LA    6,X'00000000'        SET R6 AS 0(SELECTS NEXT FILE)
         LA    7,X'00000FFE'        LOAD DIAGNOSE SUBCODE
**     DIAGNOSE SCANS ALL READER FILES IF ANY EXIST
**     DIAGNOSE READS SFBLOK FOR THE NEXT READER FILE
         DC    X'83560014'          READ SFBLOK FOR THE NEXT FILE
         BC    4,WRITE              JUMP IF ALL READER FILES SCANNED
         B     NEXTFILE             SELECT NEXT FILE
