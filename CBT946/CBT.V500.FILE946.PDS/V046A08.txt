Verify shared file directories

The VM Update article, Shared CMS file directories, (January
1990) prompted me to use saved file directories.  With over
1600 files being shared by 450 PROFS users, I save a 48M
overhead and cut swapping/paging by 50%.

The question arose: how do you tell if shared file directories
are being used? The only way is to look at virtual storage, and
see if the file directory address is higher than your virtual
machine size.  We had too many people updating directories to
have blind faith that the SAVEFD was being done.

I was unfamiliar with REXX, so the hex-to-decimal
conversions may be awkward or unnecessary.  But it works!

QSHARED EXEC

/*  */
/*       Query to see if accessed disks are using saved file
         directories.
        Written for VM/HPO 5 CMS.
        See ADTSECT for variable names.
        Logic:
           - The anchor is at x'644' in NUCON (IADT)
           - If the ADTFSTC is x'00000000', the disk is not accessed.
             (No hyperblock count)
           - If the file directory address (ADTFDA) is outside the
             virtual machine, the directory is being shared.
           - The last ADT has x'00000000' in the forward pointer
             (ADTPTR)    */
ADDR = STORAGE(646,2)                  /* GET THE FIRST ADT ADDRESS */
VMSIZE = STORAGE()                     /* VIRTUAL MACHINE SIZE      */
DO UNTIL ADTPTR = '00000000'X          /* LOOP TO LAST DISK         */
  DADDR = X2D(C2X(ADDR)) + 32          /* LOOK AT ADTFSTC@X'20'     */
  DADTFSTC = D2C(DADDR)
  ADTFSTC  = STORAGE(C2X(DADTFSTC),4)
  IF '00000000'X Â¬= ADTFSTC            /* DISK ACCESSED ?           */
       THEN DO
       DADDR =  X2D(C2X(ADDR)) + 13    /* GET FILE DIRECTORY ADDR   */
       DADTFDA = D2C(DADDR)            /* AT  +X'C'                 */
       ADTFDA =  STORAGE(C2X(DADTFDA),3)
       IF  VMSIZE >  C2X(ADTFDA)       /* Is the directory addr     */
         THEN  DO
             SHARED_STATE = 'IS NOT'  /*   not shared or           */
         END
         ELSE DO
             SHARED_STATE = 'IS'      /*     shared ?              */
       END
       DADTM = X2D(C2X(ADDR)) + 68     /* Find the mode letter      */
       DADTM = D2C(DADTM)
       ATDM =  STORAGE(C2X(DADTM),1)   /*   ATDM                    */
       SAY 'Disk' ATDM  SHARED_STATE 'using a shared directory'
  END
  ADTPTR =  STORAGE(C2X(ADDR),4)       /*  Get the next ADTSECT     */
  ADDR = ADTPTR
