Calculating free space

If you are a user of VM/XA you will be familiar with the CP
command, QUERY ALLOC.  It shows you the current status
of your system areas (TDSK, Page, Spool, and Directory) by
volume, as shown in Figure 1.  However, if what you need to
know is how much free space you still have, then you'll need to
do some paper and pencil work as well.  In order to overcome
this tedious extra work I developed an EXEC which produces
more readable output.  This output can be obtained in one of
two formats:

o      In cylinders, if you don't code anything after the EXEC
      name (see Figure 2).

o      In 4K pages, if you do code something after the EXEC
      name (see Figure 3).

The second option is necessary if you have your system areas
spread over more than one type of DASD, as the number of
pages varies from type to type.

As it is, the EXEC is ready to work with 3350s, 3375s, 3380s,
and 3390s, but any other type of DASD may be included.  For
instance, if you want to include a 3340, you will just have to
add 3340 in the variable DASD, and the number of pages (24)
in the same relative position of the variable NPAG.
