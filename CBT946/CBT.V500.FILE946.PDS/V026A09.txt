 Ghost users
Ghost users are a well known problem in VM.  There are different methods for
forcing them off, like resetting the kill bit and forcing them once more.  But
for some ghosts only an IPL will work.
I have found a way that will always work: give the ghost user a new name, then
it can stay in the system, not causing any problems, until the next IPL, when it
will go away.
The only small problem you may find is that the renamed user has write access to
some mini-disks which the original user needs.  But there is no problem using
multi-write; the ghost will not do any writing.
Sometimes it can be a problem finding the VMBLOK of the ghost with CP LOCATE
<userid>.  If the kill or log-off bit is on in the VMBLOK, it will send message
DMKCFD021E.  The FVMBLOK EXEC will always find the VMBLOK if <userid> is on.
FVMBLOCK EXEC
/* Follows the cyclic pointer in the VMBLOKs to find a user.        */
/* You have to be class C or E user to use this EXEC.               */
arg userid .
if userid = ' ' then do
     say "Userid missing "
     exit 13
     end
'EXECIO * CP (SKIP STRING DCP 0'
if rcÂ¬=0 then do
     say " User can't do DCP "
     exit 1313
     end
 'EXECIO 1 CP (VAR LOC STRING DCP 37C' /* Pointer to system vmblok  */
 parse var loc . asysvm                /* in asysvm in psa          */
 next = asysvm
 do forever
      next = strip(next)
      dnext = x2d(next)
      ptr = dnext + 8                  /* Cyclic pointer  in vmblok */
      user = dnext + 272               /* userid in vmblok          */
      ptr = d2x(ptr)
      user = d2x(user)
      'EXECIO 1 CP (VAR VMUSER STRING DCP' user||'.8'
      parse var vmuser . xuser
      cuser = x2c(strip(xuser))
      if cuser - userid then do             /* Is this the user ?  */
           say userid||'-VMBLOK:' next      /* Exit if user found  */
           exit
           end
      'EXECIO 1 CP (VAR LOC STRING DCP' ptr        /* Get next    */
      parse var loc . next
      if next = first then leave      /* Is this where we started? */
      if cuser = "SYSTEM" then first = next /* Remember startpoint */
End
say userid||'-VMBLOK does not exist'    /* Here is user not found  */
exit 3
EXAMPLE
* user zappa is the problem now:

R;
fvmblok zappa
ZAPPA-VMBLOK: 00982C00
R;
*userid = (start vmblok) + x'110'
dcp t982d10.10
982D10  E9C1D7D7  C1404040  D5C4F9F0  F2F2F2F5     *ZAPPA    ND902225*
R;

* NB. You must NOT have a user GHOST in your directory.

stcp 982d10 c7c8c6e2
stcp 982d14 e3404040
 dcp t982d10.10
982D10  C7C8D6E2  E3404040  D5C4F9F0  F2F2F2F5     *GHOST    ND902225*
R;
fvmblok ghost
GHOST-VMBLOK: 00982C00
R;
fvmblok zappa
ZAPPA-VMBLOK does not exist.
R(00003);

* Give ZAPPA multi write access to his own minidisks.
* Phone ZAPPA: You can now log on again.
