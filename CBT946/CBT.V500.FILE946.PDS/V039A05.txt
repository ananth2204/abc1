VM Update annual awards

Xephon is instituting an annual award scheme for the best articles
published in VM Update.

There are two categories: articles that saved individual subscribers
time, and articles that saved subscribers' installations money.  The
author of the best article in each category will be awarded a cash
prize of $2000 (#1250).

The winners will be chosen by a poll of subscribers; voting slips
for the 1989 awards will be sent out with the January 1990 issue.

All articles published in VM Update during 1989 are eligible for
this year's awards.
