 Reader's letter

I am trying to write an EXEC to place my RDR files into a library owned by
CMSBATCH.  Since the library is owned by CMSBATCH I must be able to link to it
READ/WRITE.  I am new to this, as a matter of fact I have never written an EXEC
before, but I was wondering if you have ever come across an EXEC similar to
this.  Also if you can offer any helpful pointers or hints on writing EXECs I
would be very grateful.  It seems to me there are no books or manuals on writing
EXECs for beginners.
