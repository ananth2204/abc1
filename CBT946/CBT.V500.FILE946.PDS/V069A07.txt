QUERY NAMES enhancement

Issue 64 of VM Update contained an article entitled QUERY
NAMES using fullscreen CMS. I made the following
enhancements to EXEC 1. We are running VM/XA 2.1 at 9003.

I changed the 'FORCE' logic to allow upper and lower case
input for the word FORCE and to process the returned value
for the user-id correctly.

Replace the lines:

      if word1 = "DATA" & word4 = "force" then do
          "FORCE" user.word2

with:

      if word1 = "DATA" & word4 = "force" | word4 = "FORCE" then do
          "CP FORCE" substr((user.word2),1,8)

The second change I made was to use a refresh PF key.
Follow:

      CHECK2 = (ASTPOS2 <> 1)

with:

      DOIT:

Update the PF key description (PFDESC) with:

      2=REFRESH

and add another WAITREAD line for PF key 2 to call DOIT, ie:

      WHEN WAITREAD.1 = "PFKEY 2" THEN CALL DOIT

In addition, add the following to the 'ERR:' subroutine,
following the ARG N statement:

      DELETE WINDOW OUTQN
      DELETE VSCREEN OUTQN
      SET FULLSCREEN OFF
