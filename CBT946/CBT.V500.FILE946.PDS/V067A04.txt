XEDIT next file in ring

There are times when I am in an XEDIT session with four or
five files being edited. XEDIT will tell you how many files are
in the current XEDIT ring but not their names.

To switch from one file to the next in the XEDIT ring you have
to remember the name of the file you want to switch to. If you
are XEDITing many files you may not remember the names of
all the files in the XEDIT ring.

The XNEXT MACRO will overcome this problem by
switching to the next file in the XEDIT ring each time it is
executed. Its use may be enhanced in an XEDIT session by
assigning the macro to a PF key in your PROFILE XEDIT.

XNEXT XEDIT may also be modified to display the files in
the XEDIT ring on your terminal.


XNEXT XEDIT

/* Function: XNEXT is used to display the next file in the XEDIT */
/*           ring when more than one file is being edited.       */
/*           This macro may be assigned to a PF key via your     */
/*           'PROFILE XEDIT'                                     */
'EXTRACT /RING/FNAME/FTYPE/FMODE/'        /* Extract list of files in */
                                          /* XEDIT ring and file id   */
                                          /* of the current file.     */
/* Search list of files in ring for current file being edited */
do i = 1 by 1 until i = ring.1
  j = i + 1
  if substr(ring.j, 1, 20) = fname.1 ftype.1 fmode.1
  then
   leave
end
if i = ring.1                  /* Last file in the list being XEDITed */
then
  j = 2                       /* Set to top of list for the next file */
else
  j = j + 1             /* Increment pointer to next file in the ring */
'XEDIT ' substr(ring.j, 1, 20)            /* XEDIT next file in ring  */
exit
