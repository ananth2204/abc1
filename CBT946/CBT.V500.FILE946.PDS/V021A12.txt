 VSE lock-file - revisited

The March issue of VM Update looked at the lock-file problem experienced with
VSE.  Jeyco asked us to point out that they developed and market SOFTKEY and not
H&M as published.  SOFTKEY will load the lock-file into 20-25K of real storage
thus giving performance similar to much larger operating systems.

Goal Systems have asked us to point out that EXTEND/VSE will eliminate the
problem of the short wait interval and the false block full condition.  If a
resource is unavailable the system will wait one second (the short wait
interval) before trying again.  Their product will 'wake up' a machine as soon
as the required resource becomes available.  Also there is no hashing performed
on a resource-id so the false block full condition cannot arise.
