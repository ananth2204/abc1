 Display the CMS stack

When writing EXECs that PUSH data onto the CMS stack it is very handy during
debugging to view the contents of the stack.  This EXEC does just that:  when
called from within an EXEC the DSTACK EXEC will display the number of stack
entries and, optionally, the stack contents.  No display is given if the stack
has zero contents.

Note:  This EXEC will remove all entries from the stack leaving it with zero
entries.

DSTACK EXEC

/* Display STACK contents (for EXEC debugging).             */
/* The only valid parameter is NOTYPE which will cause      */
/* only the number of entries to be displayed if > 0.       */
/* If omitted the lines will also be shown.                 */
