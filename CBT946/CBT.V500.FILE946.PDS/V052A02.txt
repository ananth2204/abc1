Notifying user of SPTAPE command completion

SPTAPE in VM/SP HPO does not inform the user that the
command issued has been completed.  The following is a mod
to DMKSPS which gets SPTAPE to display the text
'SPT***END' to the user who issued the command.

The above mod is set up for input to the DMKSPS module via
the UPDATE command.  DMKSPS was at PUT level 8806 on
VM/SP HPO 1.5.0 at the time this mod was applied.  You
should have some knowledge of applying maintenance to
VM/SP before attempting this.  Our method to create and apply
this mod is as follows:

Create a local AUX file, eg DMKSPS AUXLCL A,
containing:
         EDCMOD01     DISPLAY MESSAGE:  SPT***END

Create a local Update file, eg DMKSPS EDCMOD01 A,
containing the mod given above.

Run the UPDATE command to create a $DMKSPS
ASSEMBLE file, ie:
      UPDATE DMKSPS ASSEMBLE * DMKH50 (CTL

Review this file to ensure the sequence numbers reflect what is
coded in DMKSPS EDCMOD01, if not make the required
changes.

Treat the assembly process for the module DMKSPS as you
would for any other DMK module.  DMKSPS resides in CP
nucleus, so you must back-up your existing nucleus before
building and loading the new one containing this mod.
