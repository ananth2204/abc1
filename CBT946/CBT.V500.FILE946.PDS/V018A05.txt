 MSGS EXEC
A frequently encountered and disturbing situation involves running an EXEC which
was hastily or sloppily put together and leaves various CP Message settings
altered, eg EMSG set OFF.  It is often some time before this is discovered and
when it is suspected, the CP SET command must be queried, the various settings
inspected, and the various commands entered to bring things back to normal.
MSGS EXEC offers a shortcut.  Although the example below limits its use to the
four most common offenders, it can easily be expanded to cover the entirety of
the CP SET domain.
/*                           MSGS EXEC                             */
/*     This procedure simply displays the current settings of:     */
/*                     MSG, WNG, EMSG & IMSG                       */
/*         immediately prior to resetting all four to ON.          */
/*       If an individual has a personal preference for            */
/*       another setting, say 'TEXT', the individual need          */
/*       only create an EXEC called DFLTMSGS EXEC containing       */
/*       the exception(s), e.g.   CP SET IMSG TEST                 */
