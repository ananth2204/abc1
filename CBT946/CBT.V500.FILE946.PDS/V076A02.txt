Retaining the original filename for NJE print files

When a print file is sent (via NJE) from a VM system to
another system, the jobname on the receiving system is
changed. It becomes RSCSxxxx (where xxxx is the spool-id of
the original file). This often causes confusion in tracing jobs,
especially if the file is then retransmitted to another system.

The following modification to RSCS will retain the original
filename as the jobname on the receiving system. The mod
should be applied using your local procedures for system
modification.

Beware: using this mod requires that any files sent to other
systems have filenames that are valid as jobnames on the other
system. VM (but not CMS) will allow files to be created with
invalid filenames for non-VM systems.

The mod is currently runnning under RSCS Version 2 Release 2.25.

Add the following lines to DMTNHE. The lines should be
added directly after the line

      DEC2EBC R0,NJHGJNAM+4,4,work=AXSCVD

On our system, this line is at sequence number 02330000.

./ I 02330000           $ 02330001 0001                09/20/91
        SPACE
