 A VM logo screen message EXEC
I have been very interested in previously offered methods for dynamically
creating and maintaining a bulletin-type message for users to see before they
even get logged on or dialled in to a virtual machine (such as a warning not to
try!).  However, these offerings have involved modifying CP source modules, and
that is an invasive technique which I find troublesome for several reasons, but
especially so in light of the threat of IBM's 'Object Code Only' (OCO) trend.
My solution:
1    Modify only DMKBOX (since IBM explicitly 'tolerates' that, and will
probably continue to do so), with the typical customised logo plus the provision
for two unused lines at the bottom, with an eye-catcher, 'VM/SP R4', at the
beginning.
2    Include DMKBOX TEXT in the resident nucleus modules by putting it ahead of
DMKCPE in the CPLIST EXEC (or VRLIST EXEC if you have VIRTUAL=REAL), which is
used in generating the CP nucleus.
3    Use the following LOGOMSG EXEC (only by authorised users with command
privilege class C) to update those last two lines in the logo where it resides
in real memory after IPL.
