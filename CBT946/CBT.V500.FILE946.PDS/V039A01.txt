Modifications to DMKMSG

At our site we made changes to the module DMKMSG for the
following two reasons:

%   To prevent an alarm sounding when MSGNOH type messages
were received.

%   To reformat the message header.

Programs at our installation (and program products such as RSCS)
use the MSGNOH command as a way of sending information and
trivial messages to users.  Most of these messages are unimportant
so we did not want them to sound the alarm.  Typically after the
alarm has been sent to the console a HOLDING status will be
entered either when the user enters XEDIT mode or when the
screen becomes full.  After the following update is applied to
DMKMSG, the MSGNOH will be received with NO ALARM
and NO HIGHLIGHT.

The standard message format is as follows:

    HH:MM:SS
         <CR>
         <CR>
         MESSAGE FROM xxxx: aaaaaaa bbbbbbb ccccccc dd
         <CR>
         <CR>

Our new message format is:

    HH:MM:SS * MESSAGE FROM xxxx
      aaaaaaa bbbbbbb ccccccc dd

This change eliminates unnecessary blank lines.

Both changes apply to VM/SP Release 5 level 514.
