The REXX Handbook contains over 300 pages and is made up
of 14 chapters. The book gives an overview of what REXX is
and how the language is structured, before setting out on a
detailed description of how to write REXX EXECs.

The other chapters cover topics such as program structure and
syntax, control structures, subroutines and functions,
commands to external environments, character string handling,
the PARSE instruction, input and output, the external data
queue, exception handling, the INTERPRET instruction,
REXX arithmetic, and tracing and debugging. Two appendices
list REXX instructions and REXX built-in functions.

The book can be used as a teach-yourself REXX text book and
would be of use to both the beginner and the improver. The
book is full of examples of REXX code and makes a
comprehensive reference book. It would, perhaps, have been a
good idea to collect all the hints and tips along with other
suggestions for improving the performance of REXX EXECs in
a separate chapter or appendix. This would help people writing
in REXX to produce code that not only works but also works
as efficiently and economically, in terms of system usage, as
possible.
