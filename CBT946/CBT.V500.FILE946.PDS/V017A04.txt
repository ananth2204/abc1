 CMS multifarious access
CMS allows seven modes of access:
    R W M RR WR MR & MW
where the first letter denotes primary access (read, write as the single user
with access, write with multiple users having access) and the second letter
denotes alternative access granted when 'primary' conditions are not met.
The manual states "more than one user writing to the same virtual device can
result in a permanent loss of data": for 'can' read 'often does'!
I advocate the wider use of the MR option taking precautions until such time as
IBM makes it safer to use.  MR is commonly frowned upon, principally for two
reasons:
1    The same password covers MR and MW
2    For several years IBM inadvertently increased the risk of corruption by
advocating MW as the default option for CMS users thus causing confusion as to
the true status of MW.
Two steps would make the use of MR more attractive, viz:
1    Instigate a fourth level of password for the MW option.
2    Justify the MW options still existing in the sample directory.
I outline two EXECs below that use the MR feature while keeping at bay the
pitfalls associated with MW.
TPXU allows multiple users to update the file TP BIN C without the loss of
integrity.
SAVETZ copies a version of a CMS file to the Z disk.  Integrity is enhanced by
holding the MR password in assembly source mode A0: update being performed using
MR without compromising the password.
