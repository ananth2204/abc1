 CMS performance considerations
Many sites have installed or retained a VM system because they like the
facilities and features available with CMS, and prefer to use this rather than
migrate to, for example, TSO.  The ease with which it can be used often leads to
poorly designed applications which make inefficient use of the resources
available.  This article looks at some areas that might be worth re-examining
when considering improving CMS in terms of I/O performance.
Some potential ways of reducing I/O are:
y    Format all CMS mini-disks in blocks of 4K.  This will greatly reduce the
I/O rate.
y    Use multiple S and Y disks if I/O rates to the existing ones are too high.
Also make use of R/O disks.
y    Use RECFM F rather than RECFM V because it is generally faster.  However,
this saving in time is achieved by using more disk space.
y    Disks that do not have any EXEC, MODULES, or XEDIT macros on them are not
searched when a filename is keyed in.  It, therefore, helps if they are not
placed on data disks.
y    With SP release 5 and above the SAVEFD command can be used to make the file
directories of common CMS mini-disks shared.  This saves both storage and I/O.
y    Consider using CMS I/O which is typically faster than OS simulation.
y    With SP release 5 and above, any commonly used EXECs can  be placed in the
installation segment - DCSSGEN.  Because they are available in read-only mode to
all users this method can save on both time and storage.
