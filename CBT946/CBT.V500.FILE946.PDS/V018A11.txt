 Reader's letter

Darrell Singleton's problem (VM Update December) sounds similar to one that I
tackled at our installations.  We have several disconnected 'collection'
machines which sit all day waiting for work to be sent to them.  I abandoned CP
SLEEP and discounted IBM's WAKEUP module because it wakes up whenever a reader
file arrives.  In our case, the virtual machine would leave the file in the
reader because it was not one that it wanted to process.  However, because
WAKEUP saw the reader file still there it would wake up  again, causing it to
loop all the time.

The solution was to write a simple module whose function was to sit in an
enabled wait until a Device End occurred for the virtual reader.  It then exits
to whoever called it.  If the reader file remains in the RDR, nothing happens
until the next file arrives in the reader.

To invoke it, the calling EXEC issues:

     READY
     &GOTO -PROCESS

When the Ready is invoked the virtual machine willl enter an enabled wait until
a DE occurs, then the module exits and the following GOTO gets executed.

The routine could be modified to recognise any other interrupt Darrell feels
would better suit his application.
