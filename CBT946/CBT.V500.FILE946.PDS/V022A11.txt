The book is designed as a complete beginner's guide to VM/CMS.  This, to a large
extent, is an aim that it successfully achieves.  The text assumes that the
reader has almost no knowledge of computers or the VM environment and, using
examples, builds up information a block at a time.  Each chapter ends with a
list of new terminology introduced, and a statement of the objectives of that
chapter.  This helps the new user get to grips with the information.
The information presented is comprehensive, although at times the style is
somewhat heavy going.  The book takes the new reader through logging on to CMS,
creating files using XEDIT and storing them on mini-disks.  The most frequently
used end-user commands are covered in some detail and are easy to follow.
Other areas usefully covered are use of spool files and backing up files.
Areas that are omitted from the book that might perhaps have been usefully
included are: VSAM file handling, use of Passthrough and the DIAL command, use
of IPF or ISPF, and an introduction to REXX.  (A further book on this topic is
promised.)  In general, the book can act as a very useful primer for the person
who is new to, or infrequently uses, the CMS environment.
