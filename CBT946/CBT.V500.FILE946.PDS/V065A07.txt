Reader's letter

I found the Programmer tools for VM/XA in the November
issue of VM Update very interesting - I had been trying to get
the old QCOMMAND to run on XA when I had spare time.
There is a mistake in the QCOMMAND procedure which
causes the SET option not to work. On page 35, the routine
called SAYIT uses "text" as an arg parameter. This destroys
the previously used arg parameter "text" at the beginning of the
procedure (SET command value). To correct this problem
change the two "text" variables (in the "parse" and "say" lines)
to any other value - I used "saytext".
