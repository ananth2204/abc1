Reader's letter

The article entitled Display fixed free storage pages by Kevin
Potter in issue 47 states that class C is required for the DCP
command.  The command requires only class E, which is less
dangerous than class C.  Class C users can write in real
storage, while class E users can only read.

The fields used as counts of extends and unextends are mapped
by the system symbol table and can be referenced using
Diagnose 38.  This would eliminate the need to look at the
nucleus map or DMKSYS.
