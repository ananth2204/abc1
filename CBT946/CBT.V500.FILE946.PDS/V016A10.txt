 Performance hints and tips

There are two SET commands which can have an effect on paging and performance.
The SET QDROP OFF command allows the naming of users who are exempt from having
their pages placed on the flush list.  This can benefit a user who is severely
affected by paging, but will have a detrimental effect on others.  However, it
is not recommended to use the command for relatively inactive users as this can
cause more problems than it solves.

The SET RESERVE command allows real storage pages to be reserved for a user.
This will reduce the user's paging, but again will have a detrimental effect on
other users.  Deciding on the correct value to set can be a headache, and
incorrect values can make the usual paging problems much worse.
