 Performance hints and tips

When generating DMKSYS system performance can be optimised by allocating the
appropriate amount of free storage space.  This space is needed for both I/O and
paging subsystems, and if the space is too small performance will deteriorate.
If the space is too large this is wasteful of space.  To find out if the free
storage space has been correctly specified it is necessary to display the two
full words at DMKFRENP in real storage, at regular intervals throughout a
working day.  If the value of the first full word remains at, or near, zero it
indicates that the allocated free storage space is adequate for current usage.
If the value of the first full word is more than 3E it will be worth increasing
the amount of free storage space.  Calculating how many additional pages are
needed is done by subtracting the initial value of the second word displayed
from the highest recorded value of the second word displayed.  This value is in
hex and needs to be converted to decimal.  The DMKSYS FREE parameter can be
increased by this amount.  Naturally, after any change to the system, it should
be monitored to ensure that only the desired effect was achieved.
