Reader's letter

The article entitled Obtaining an unused virtual address in the
January issue of VM Update contained a program called
GETFMADR.  It works better if CLC   0(4,R12),=F'0' in
LOOPFM is changed to CLC   0(2,R12),=H'0'.  If this is done
GETFMADR always returns the first unused filemode.  The way
it was it did not return an unused filemode if it had previously
been used and then released.  This was tested on VM/HPO 5.
