 Reader's letter

We have Application System Release 5, and we would like to find out if there is
a way to wake a virtual machine after you have issued a CP SLEEP.  We put a
batch machine up to process transactions and it seems to me that we could sleep
it until it gets a transaction and then send it an attention interrupt.
Currently we sleep it for a few seconds (cp sleep 2 secs) and let it check for a
transaction, which eats up CPU strokes if there are no transactions.  We would
like to wake it up on the transaction instead.
