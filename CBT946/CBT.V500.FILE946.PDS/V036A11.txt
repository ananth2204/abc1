Performance hints and tips

The following suggestions should minimise the real storage
constraint for HPO users:

%	Ensure that the FSA is not over allocated.

%	Tailor the loadlist to reduce the size of the nucleus.

%	Eliminate all unnecessary devices from user directory entries.
This reduces the number of control blocks used in the FSA.

%	Number virtual device addresses consecutively to minimise
the number of virtual channel and virtual control unit blocks.

%	Reduce the size of the trace table using the trace option of the
SYSCOR macro in DMKSYS.

%	Reduce the number of monitor buffers using the BUFFS
option of the SYSCOR macro - watch for monitor suspension
records.

%	Migrate to XA and buy more central storage.
