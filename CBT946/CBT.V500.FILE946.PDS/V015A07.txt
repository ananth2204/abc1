 Test system tape mounts

If your shop has VM Software Inc's VMTAPE and IBM's Programmable Operator
(PROP), there is a simple way to have multiple VM systems route their mount
requests to one tape operator console.  We run one VM/SP HPO production system
and one test system under VM/XA SF.  We have both PROP and VMTAPE (actually all
of VMCENTER) on both systems.  Out by the tape drives we have the TAPOPR-id
logged on to the production system.  In order to get all your mount requests
over to the TAPOPR id on production from the test system, make the following
modifications to the test system.

1    In the VMTAPE configuration file make OPERATOR your TAPEOPER.  (I am
assuming that PROP is running in the OPERATOR Virtual Machine.)

2    In the PROP routing table add these lines to call the action routine
TAPEOPR

   /CMD/SMSG VMTAPE           TAPOPR        DMSPOR    TOVM
   /CMD/SMSG VMBACKUP         TAPOPR        DMSPOR    TOVM
                              VMTAPE        TAPEOPR
                              TAPOPR        TAPEOPR
                              VMBACKUP      TAPEOPR

     Besides doing the message routing this also allows TAPOPR to issue commands
to VMTAPE on the test system (ie TELL OP AT TEST CMD SMSG VMTAPE QUERY REQ; TELL
OP AT TEST CMD SMSG VMBACKUP QUERY JOB).  See Figure 1.

3    Code the following action routine (TAPEOPR EXEC) and place on one of
OPERATOR'S accessed disks.

Make sure your SYSTEM NETIDS and your RSCS nodes are consistent.  We have used
this same concept to make our production system logical operator act as logical
operator to both VM systems.
