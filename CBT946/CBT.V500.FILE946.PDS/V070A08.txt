Reader's letter

In the March 1992 issue of VM Update, Dudley Johnson's
article entitled XEDIT next file in ring gave us XNEXT
XEDIT, which is unnecessary. Dudley may be unaware of the
Query RING XEDIT subcommand, which shows what files are
in the ring and the order that they are in. He may also be
unaware that the XEDIT subcommand does not require any
arguments. If X is entered without arguments, XEDIT will
switch to the next file in the ring.

Editor's note: other readers have made the same points about
the article, and also that the code as presented may not work if
the terminal display is divided into multiple logical screens
which show multiple views of a file.
