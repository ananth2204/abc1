 Reader's letter

The article VM and performance by A Phillips in the June 1987 issue ignored the
SET SRM commands to control VM performance.  The command offers the ability to
exercise greater control over memory management and to allocate memory usage
between interactive and compute-bound users.

'SET SRM MINNUMSS' ensures that a certain number of page frames are available in
main memory to service page-in and swap-in requests.

'SET SRM SWPQTIME' specifies the length of time that users retain page frames
before becoming candidates for swapping out.

'SET SRM IBUF' controls the size and time duration for residence in the
interactive buffer.

I use the last command to mediate between interactive and batch users.  By
reducing the interactive buffer, I make additional page frames available to
production jobs.  If interactive performance is poor, I increase the buffer to
provide better response time to users.

Tuning is discussed in the Washington Systems Center Technical Bulletin GG22-
9392, VM/SP High Performance Option Release 3.4 Performance Tuning Guide.
Although the guide is two years old it still has valuable examples and
explanations of tuning approaches.  A word of caution, using certain
combinations of  the commands can have a negative impact on your system.  The
effect of some of the commands is not intuitively obvious.  Read the guide
several times in its entirety.  Pay heed to the golden rule (as A Phillips
notes):  make only one change at a time.
