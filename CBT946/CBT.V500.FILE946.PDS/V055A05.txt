Putting KPLOGO back after VM41468

After applying an APAR to our VM/XA SP 2.1 system, it was
noticed that the VSCS VM logo was missing including the
'Extended ONLINE' message (called KPLOGO in HCPVCX).
To get a better understanding of the use of KPLOGO, here is a
brief history of VM logos, starting with VM/SP 5.

VM/SP Release 5, introduced full screen VM logo support,
which included the VSCS logos (with VM/VTAM Version 3)
that would allow LOGONs from the VM logo screen.

There were 3 fields on the logo screen, USERID,
PASSWORD, and a COMMAND line, that allowed easier
LOGONs from any type of access, while still protecting the
password in a non-display field.  This full screen logo support
also allowed DIAL commands to be executed without having to
add additional keystrokes to get to CP READ, and also
displayed short 'help' messages if the log-on was incorrect or
missing.

The VSCS VM logo under this version also included support
for the 'Extended ONLINE' message, for versions of VTAM
that did not support the full screen log-on.  The 'Extended
ONLINE' message is simply an extension to the top line of the
VM logo, containing a message after the ONLINE text, stating
that you need to "PRESS ENTER KEY TO BEGIN
SESSION".

HCPVCX was locally modified at the KPLOGO definition
('Extended ONLINE' message), and reworded to read "Type
VMEXIT to return to VTAM (@)".  Since VM/VTAM already
allowed the log-on from the logo screen, it did not need to state
"PRESS ENTER...", and we wanted our users to know 'where'
they were and how to 'get out' using VMEXIT.

VM/XA SP 2.0 had its own 'flavour' of VM logo support,
which very closely resembled the (much) older VM/SP version.
Remember, VM/XA was not an extension to an existing
version of VM, but an entirely separate version.  (We often
forget this when functions in VM/XA are 'missing from' or
'different from' how they were on VM/SP or VM/SP HPO.)

A local VM/XA SP 2.0 terminal would have a LOGON line at
the bottom, to allow the user to LOGON from the logo screen.
Passwords were not suppressed unless the CP SET
PASSWORD LOGON SEPARATE command was used
(default setting when the system is IPLed).  Also, there was no
'help' if the log-on was incorrect or missing; you would either
get a blank screen in CP READ, or an error message would
'flash' on the screen for a brief moment before the VM logo
reappeared.

A user on a VSCS terminal would get a VM logo screen with
no LOGON line, and would have to "PRESS ENTER..."  to
start a VM session (LOGON, DIAL, etc), no matter which
version of VM/VTAM was running.  The 'Extended ONLINE'
message was included in HCPVCX, so again, it was reworded
locally to "PRESS ENTER to start a VM session.  Type
VMEXIT to return to VTAM (@)".

In essence, VM appeared to be digressing as far as the VM
logo support was concerned, when going from VM/SP 5 to
VM/XA SP 2.0.  But it got much better.

VM/XA SP 2.1 corrected and/or added more logo support,
with the 'log-on compatibility' code included in APAR
VM39939.  This compatibility made VM/XA SP 2.1 logos
work just like VM/SP or VM/HPO logos did.  The three input
lines were back (LOGON, PASSWORD, COMMAND), along
with the brief 'help' messages, and the logo was not
automatically re-displayed after a message was given.  Also the
ENTER key would need to be depressed after a LOGOFF to re-
display the logo.  This allowed the users time to READ the
LOGON and LOGOFF messages.  Another great addition to
VM/XA!

Again, HCPVCX was updated locally to change the 'Extended
ONLINE' message at KPLOGO back to the short "Type
VMEXIT..."  text.  Because of the full screen logo support,
VM/XA and VM/VTAM again allowed log-ons from the logo
screen.

But, the 'logon compatibility' added a lot of code to HCPBOX,
and if you had local changes to it, most likely you would get
addressability errors when you assembled it.  Basically, the
new code and local updates will push HCPBOX over the FFF
limit for a one base register.  IBM fixed this problem with
APAR VM41468 (PTF UM15523).  Reading the text for this
fix, it looked like an excellent solution to the problem; split
HCPBOX and move the code that writes logos to HCPBOY
(new module), and let HCPBOX contain all the logo data
definitions.  HCPVCX moved entry point HCPVCXGO to
HCPBOY for writing logos on VSCS terminals, to keep the
code consistent and in one place.

After applying the APAR, and attempting to fit our local
modifications back on to HCPVCX, it was found that the
KPLOGO definition was gone.  After scanning the update files
for VM41468, it showed that KPLOGO was deleted, and not
redefined anywhere.  Looking at the new HCPBOY module, I
found that VSCS is checked as to whether log-ons were
supported from the logo.  If so, the logo was built exactly like
a local VM logo.  The KPLOGO or 'Extended ONLINE'
message was removed without warning - the APAR made no
indication that it would be.


THE 'UNKNOWN' IBM VM LOGO STRATEGY

Since our site used KPLOGO to notify the user that they are on
a VSCS terminal, I felt that a feature, albeit small, was
removed from VM.  So, a problem was opened with IBM.
After a long deliberation, it was concluded that the removal of
KPLOGO was for "compatibility in the VM logos", and that
putting KPLOGO back "would have a negative impact on the
VM strategy".  IBM's direction on the VM logos is to make
them all look alike, no matter how or where your terminal is
connected to the VM system.

It's a good strategy, but we still contested that this change had
been 'slipped in' with a fix for HCPBOX's addressability, and
that some sort of notification should be made when pieces are
removed from VM.  At least the direction of VM logos could
have been documented to help explain their intentions before
removing KPLOGO.

Since we were putting VM/XA SP 2.1 into production and
needed a way to include the "VMEXIT" message on the VSCS
logo, we created our own KPLOGO.  The problem was
dropped because we had created a local solution, and they felt
there was no longer any problem.


HOW TO PUT KPLOGO BACK

If you have modified KPLOGO, and will be installing, or have
installed, the VM/XA SP 2.1 APAR VM41468, then you can
put back the 'Extended ONLINE' or KPLOGO message fairly
easily with the following CP code modifications. Follow these
steps to make the required changes.

1      Add to or create a local AUX file for HCPBOY, called
      HCPBOY AUXLCL, and for HCPBOX, called HCPBOX
      AUXLCL.  Add the following record to both files.  (You
      can use your own AUX file structure and names, if you
      prefer.)

      LOCALFIX LCL * Add the Extended ONLINE message back for VSCS logos

2      The first update file, for HCPBOY, adds code to call
      HCPBOXKP to build the 'Extended ONLINE' message
      even if VSCS supports log-ons from the logo.  I called the
      update file HCPBOY LOCALFIX for this example.  The
      scale line is for reference only - do not include it in the
      HCPBOY LOCALFIX file!

3      The update for HCPBOX is a little more complicated,
      since you most likely have made local updates to the logo.
      If you follow these steps, the update should apply cleanly.

      o      Create a file with the following code.  For this
      example, I used a file-id of HCPBOX CODE.  Again,
      the scale line is for reference only.  You can modify
      KPLOGO to fit your installations requirements.

      o      Next, use the XEDIT command for HCPBOX
            ASSEMBLE with the CTL option.  Make sure your
            CP disks are accessed by VMFSETUP.

            XEDIT HCPBOX ASSEMBLE (CTL HCPXA

            You should receive a messages stating "Update
            HCPBOX LOCALFIX was not found".  This is okay,
            since that is the file you are now going to create.

      o      You need to find the ENTLINS EQU statement in the
            HCPBOXPE entry.  Enter on the XEDIT command
            line:

            /*-ENTLIN1

            That should put the current line on the ENTLINS EQU
            statement.  If not, you can find it manually in the
            HCPBOXPE entry area.

      o      The new code should be inserted after the next line (an
            EJECT), so move down 1 line, by typing:

            DOWN 1

      o      Insert the HCPBOX CODE file now, by typing:

            GET HCPBOX CODE

            This should get the file you created earlier and put that
            code into HCPBOX.  Scroll up and verify the code.

      o      Type FILE on the command line to save the updates in
            HCPBOX LOCALFIX.

4      Reassemble HCPBOY and HCPBOX using VMFHASM.
      Correct any Assembler errors if needed, and regen your CP
      system.
