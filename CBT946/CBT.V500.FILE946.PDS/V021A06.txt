 Simulated REXX interpreter
This program simulates a line-by-line REXX interpreter.  It can be used as a
calculator, as a tutorial aid in REXX courses, as a quick check for usage of
lesser-known functions and even for testing small programs that fit into the
130-byte input line of CMS.  The following is a sample of its usage:
rexx
Exit=quit-------------->   Rexx Environment   <-----------------?=help
do k=1 by 2 for 7; say center(copies('*',k),80); end
                                       *
                                      ***
                                     *****
                                    *******
                                   *********
                                  ***********
                                 *************

say 2**10-512

Our original help facility is in IOS3270 full screen format and was modified to
line mode.  Few changes are required in the source code for installations that
wish to switch to full-screen mode.
REXX EXEC
trace off
if arg(1) = '?' then call h_l_p; else 'VMFCLEAR'
say 'Exit=quit'copies('-',19)'>' '1de8'x 'Rexx Environment' '1d60'x,
'<'copies('-',20)'?=help'
syntax: if rc ¬= 0 then say  '/('rc') 'errortext(rc)
signal on syntax

   address command 'CP BEGIN'                 /* forces rc = 0     */

   else if $$com$$ = '?' ! $$com$$ = 'help' then call h_l_p
   else if find('quit end',$$com$$ ¬= 0     then exit

       do n=sourceline()-20 to sourceline()
          say sourceline(n)

       'CP SLEEP';'VMFCLEAR'
       return
Format  : REXX or REXX ? (to enter this Help first)
Function: Creates an interactive environment for REXX commands .
Notes   : This program puts you in a REXX environment, which means
          that every input line will be interpreted by the REXX
          processor until you type exit, quit or end.
          In this environment, character '/' has the same meaning as
          R; in CMS. Wrong inputs will be displayed as /(n), where 'n'
          is the return code of the command entered.
          To get a help menu of all commands, variables and functions,
          type HELP REXX MENU.  A more especific help is obtained by
          typing HELP REXX followed by the command, variable or
          function to be queried, as in HELP REXX SAY.
Example : After press <ENTER>, try the following sequence:
input   : line = 'Today is' date(e) /*line contains Today is dd/mm/yy*/
output  : /
input   : say line                  /* command say                  */
output  : Today is dd/mm/yy         /* display line contents        */
output  : /
input   : exit                /* command exit - leaves this program */
