 Reader's letter
Regarding the Ghost users article in the October 1988 issue of VM Update: in the
case where the first VMBLOK has an 'E' anywhere in the value, there are no other
alpha characters in the address, the only significant character before the 'E'
is a '0' or '1' located immediately to the left of the 'E', and there is another
VMBLOK that meets the same criteria, REXX will say that they are equal.  This is
because REXX will interpret both values as '0' or '1' raised to some power,
which is still '0' or '1'.  As an example, say the first VMBLOK after the system
VMBLOK is at 00E95000 and later in the loop the FVMBLOCK EXEC encounters a
VMBLOK address of 00E63000, the statement
     if first = next then leave
will evaluate as follows:
     first = 00E95000 = 0 * (10 ** 95000) = 0
     next = 00E63000 = 0 * (10 ** 63000) = 0
     0 = 0
In order to rectify the problem, when equating addresses use '==', which does a
text character-for-character comparison, or convert to decimal or character data
before comparing.
