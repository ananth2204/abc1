 -Performance hints and tips
Tuning VM/XA SP has certain similarities to tuning VM/SP and HPO, but there are
also many different commands.  VM/XA SP does not have a swapping function like
HPO, but it does block paging, which is somewhat similar.  To preserve locality
of reference of pages on disk, all pages, whether changed or not, are written to
disk.  You will probably therefore observe higher paging rates on VM/XA SP than
on HPO.  VM/XA uses suspend/resume channel programs (sometimes called Seldom-
Ending channel programs) for its paging.  It is highly desirable therefore to
use dedicated volumes for paging, or at least to put paging on volumes with very
inactive data.  VM/XA SP does not support page migration, except from expanded
storage to disk.
