Do I need VM/ESA? - revisited

In the January 1991 issue of VM Update, there was an article
entitled Do I need VM/ESA?  I would like to respond to part of
that article.

In one paragraph, the article states "Would a VM/SP site want
to migrate to VM/ESA?  The answer is probably no".  In the
same paragraph, the author states "The reason is obvious:
VM/SP offers all the facilities that the users require, and is
probably running multiple VSE systems under it which are
performing the majority of work done at that site".

The author has overlooked the possibility of those VSE guests
being VSE/ESA guests.  Two of the biggest enhancements to
VSE/ESA were the XA I/O subsystem and support for more
than 16MB of real memory.  VM/SP will not support either of
these enhancements.  VM/SP HPO will allow more than 16MB
of real memory, but it cannot support the XA I/O channel
commands.  VM/ESA, in ESA mode, is the only way to fully
support a VSE/ESA guest.  Without VM/ESA, VSE/ESA
would provide only a few enhancements over VSE/SP.

VSE/ESA will be the reason shops migrate from VM/SP or
HPO to VM/ESA.  As more VSE guests are migrating to
VSE/ESA, the more VM/ESA will be required.
