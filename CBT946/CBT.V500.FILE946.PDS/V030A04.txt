 DASD space management EXECs
The following EXECs can be used to compress and uncompress CMS files in order to
save DASD space.  SQ copies the file to a temporary file with the pack option,
deletes the original file and then renames the temporary file back to the
original.  UNSQ does the same except it uses the unpack option.
The EXECs can be entered directly on the FILELIST screen.  From the FILELIST
screen, files that have been SQed have a record length of 1024.  After executing
UNSQ, they return to their original record length.
The format of the command is:
     SQ or UNSQ Ý fn ft fm¨
where fn = the filename, ft = the filetype and fm = the filemode (default 'A').
Two messages are generated from the SQ EXEC.  The first, "COMPRESSING FILE fn ft
fm", appears when the file is being copied with the pack option.  The second
message, "fn ft fm HAS BEEN COMPRESSED!", is displayed upon successful
completion of the SQ function.
Two messages are generated from the UNSQ EXEC.  The first, "RESTORING FILE fn ft
fm TO ITS NATURAL STATE", appears when the file is being copied with the unpack
option.  The second message, "fn ft fm HAS BEEN UNCOMPRESSED!", is displayed
upon successful completion of the UNSQ function.
ÝEditor's note: the code for both programs is very similar, therefore, the code
for SQ is printed with the alterations needed for UNSQ given in italics.¨

If the uncompressed CMS files is required in XEDIT mode, the following line can
be added at the end of the UNSQ EXEC
"XEDIT" FILENAME FILETYPE FILEMODE
