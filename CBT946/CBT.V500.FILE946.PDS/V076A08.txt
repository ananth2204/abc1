More about SET MORE command

Recently in issue 74 of VM Update (October 1992) Shimon
Lebowitz proposed a very interesting implementation of the
SET MORE command for the VM/ESA CP environment. The
problem is that the important point of who calls the defined
entry HPCCFSMO was omitted. This leads to the result that
the SET MORE command is not known to the system. The
system has to learn that the option MORE is allowed. In other
words only the Q SET command leads to the output presented
in the article. The corresponding routine which was omitted
and which handles the SET command is HCPSET. This is why
we prepared the new APAR. The source of the APAR is shown
below.

We propose also another APAR for routine HCPGRW,which
also is modified in the approach of Shimon Lebowitz. The idea
of this APAR is described below.

Imagine that there is a message or other alarm signal on the
screen. In this case, if you start the task which produces output
longer than the screen size, the status HOLDING appears, even
if you have defined SET MORE 0 255. In this situation, our
APAR results in the status MORE, and if SET MORE 0 255
was defined continuous scrolling is active. For settings of
MORE other than 0 255, the usual status HOLDING appears.
