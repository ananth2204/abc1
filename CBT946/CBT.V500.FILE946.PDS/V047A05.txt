Editing the previously edited file

Quite often I wish to edit the same file that I just finished
editing.  Instead of issuing FILEL (which can be a little slow at
times) or typing 'X fn ft fm' to edit the last file edited, I use the
following EXEC called XX.  Just type 'XX' and press the
ENTER key to invoke XEDIT on the last file edited.

For XX to work, you will need to add the following lines of
code to your PROFILE XEDIT file (if it is written in REXX):

   /* The following code saves fn ft fm for 'XX EXEC'              */
      'EXTRACT /FNAME/FTYPE/FMODE/RING'
      fn = FNAME.1
      ft = FTYPE.1
      fm = FMODE.1
      if RING.1 < 2
         then address CMS 'globalv select' USERID() 'put fn ft fm'
   /* End of 'XX EXEC' code                                        */

XX EXEC

   /* This exec edits the last file edited using XEDIT.            */
      'globalv select' USERID() 'get fn ft fm'
      if fn = ''
         then say 'No file information save at this time.'
         else 'xedit' fn ft fm
      exit
