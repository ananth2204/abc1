Digital clock for XEDIT - revisited

In the April 1991 issue of VM Update Vince Levey gave an
EXEC to be executed which displays a digital clock in the top
right-hand corner of your XEDIT screen.  Mr Levey must be
congratulated on his novel use of the STATUS vscreen and I
immediately implemented it.  Because I always use fullscreen
CMS, I encountered the following problems:

o      I found that the status line disappears because the STATUS
      vscreen is deleted and redefined.

      To bypass that problem, I defined a new window, called
      $$TIME, which is shown on the STATUS vscreen.  Many
      users do not realize that more than one window may be
      shown on the same vscreen.  The time is shown on the
      status line and in the digital clock, but it is the same data.

o      I then found that any PF keys that I press (PF7 - $WM
      BACKWARD = 1, PF8 - $WM FORWARD = 1) have no
      effect while in CMS.  I found out that they were all
      absorbed by the $$TIME window.  Paging forward or
      backward in a one-line vscreen with a one-line window has
      no effect.  Pressing PF3 ($WM DROP WINDOW =) is
      also ineffective.  The $$TIME window gets updated
      regularly by the clock (every second) and then jumps to the
      top of the windows because the option POP TOP is in
      effect.

o      This problem was bypassed with the options POP NOTOP.
      The POP option still causes the clock to be shown but
      NOTOP prevents it from absorbing the commands.

The result is the following commands that I include in my
PROFILE EXEC:

      WINDOW DEFINE $$TIME 1 7 1 -8 (FIXED NOBORDER POP NOTOP SYSTEM
      SET LOCATION $$TIME OFF
      WINDOW SHOW $$TIME ON STATUS
