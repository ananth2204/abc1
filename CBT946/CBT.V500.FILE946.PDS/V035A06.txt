Skip to logical end of line

Methods of moving along a line when XEDITing a file use the
cursor keys, tab, and skip to physical end of line.

This simple REXX routine puts the cursor at the logical end of
whichever line it is in, ie immediately following the last non-
blank character of the line.  Once there, continuation data can be
entered, or the next line joined using JOIN or SPLTJOIN.  It is,
of course, only really useful when incorporated as a PF key.  It
must have a filetype of XEDIT.

Whether or not it is actually able to get to the logical end of line is
affected by the VERIFY and TRUNC settings.  The prefix
subcommand 'E' has a similar effect, but requires the cursor to be
in the prefix area, and also opens up another line for extension.
The CAPPEND macro requires the cursor to be in the command
area, and only works on the current line.  We find ourselves using
this alternative constantly.
