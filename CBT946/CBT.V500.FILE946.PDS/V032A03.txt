Expanded query reader

On many occasions I have found it necessary to search all reader
files, looking for an entry that begins with a specific string of
characters.  Although POWER has a facility for this (D
RDR,*ABC), VM does not.  This EXEC accepts a string of
characters and then scans all reader entries, looking for any whose
name contains these characters.  This EXEC can easily be
changed to perform the same function on punch and printer queue
entries.  You must have class D privileges to use this EXEC.


QRDR EXEC

/* Display RDR files whose names begin with argument given */
trace n
arg name .
if name = '' then exit 4
if substr(name,length(name),1) = '*' then name =
substr(name,1,length(name)-1)
'MAKEBUF'
'EXECIO 1 CP ( FIFO STRING QUERY SCREEN'
pull . cpout . . vmout .
'EXECIO 0 CP ( STRING SCREEN VMOUT' cpout
'EXECIO * CP ( FIFO STRING Q R ALL'
pull head
saidhead = 0
do queued()
 pull line
 parse var line with . . . . . . . . fn .
 a = index(fn,name)
 if a ¬=0 then do
     if ¬saidhead then do
         say head
         saidhead = 1
                        end
     say line
                          end
end
if ¬saidhead then say 'NO RDR FILES'
EXIT:
'DROPBUF'
'EXECIO 0 CP ( STRING SCREEN VMOUT' vmout
exit
