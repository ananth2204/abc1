Calculate length of COBOL picture clauses - again

I have used the Calculate and total COBOL picture clauses
routine, printed in issue 47, very often.  Sometimes, I found it
calculated a wrong result.  I debugged the program and found a
trap under special circumstances.  In a few of our source
programs, COMP or COMP-3 was coded in columns 73-80,
but not in the COBOL area.  This area is normally not
displayed by XEDIT.  One additional statement (see below)
will eliminate this trap.


/* Add Picture routine.                                               */
add_pic:                                         /* Add_pic routine.  */
if substr(cl,7,1)='*' ,                          /* Is it a comment,  */
 | strip(cl)='' ,                                /* or a blank line,  */
 | word(cl,1)='88' then                          /* or an '88' level? */
    return                                       /* Yes, ignore it.   */
cl = left(cl,72)       /* Ignore columns 73-80   */
do pw=1 to words(cl)                             /* Do for each word. */
    wk=word(cl,pw)                               /* Extract word.     */
    y=abbrev('PICTURE',wk,3)                     /* Is is PICture?    */
    if y then leave                              /* Yes, leave.       */
end                                              /* End DO.           */
parse var cl level .                             /* Extract LEVEL.    */

A second change is necessary, if a picture clause has defined
an even number of digits together with COMP-3.  The original
code will calculate the length based on an intermediate result
which contains a fraction.  The error is at the top of page 24 of
issue 47.  It said:

      when c3>0 then len=(len+1)/2

It should read:

      when c3>0 then len=trunc(((len+1)/2)+.5)
