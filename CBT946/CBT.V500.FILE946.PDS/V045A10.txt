Reader's letter
There was a very interesting article in issue 43 about problems
with MACLIBs.  However, I was astonished to find the QCP
EXEC to issue CP commands without displaying messages.
There is a simpler technique to do it, ie code EXECIO with a 0
instead of an * for the 'lines' operand.  This will prevent the
messages being written to the program stack.  An alternative is
to use the SKIP option.  For more details see page 173 of the
CMS manual SC19-6209-4.
