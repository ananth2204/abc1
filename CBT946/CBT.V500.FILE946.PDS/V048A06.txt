Monitoring seeks by track

The VM/SP Monitor includes seek monitoring, which can be
used to find the active cylinders on the disks being monitored.
In our installation we found the seek information to be lacking
an important detail, ie the track being accessed on the cylinder.
Since we are a      VM/VSE installation, with VSE files
allocated on track boundaries (and not necessarily on cylinder
boundaries), we wanted access to this additional information in
order to find the active tracks within the VSE-controlled disks.

On examining the information supplied by the seek monitor
function, I found a 1-byte field which had no value (at least to
us) - MN7000DIR.  This field is intended to give the direction
of the current seek, to a higher or lower cylinder.  However,
since our disks are shared between two VM systems with VSE
running in both, this information is useless, as the other system
can always perform a seek to some other cylinder.

In order to get the information we wanted in the monitor
records, I decided to use the MN700DIR field for the track
number of the current seek, rather than making any changes in
the monitor record size.

The mod  I wrote is applied to DMKMON, just after label
COM700, where MN700DIR is to be set.  It replaces the five
lines beginning with TM RDEVFLAG,RDEVSKUP (four lines
after COM700) label SEKNOTUP.  By looking at the seek
CCW whose address is currently in IOBCAW, the track
number can be simply copied into the monitor record.  To
prevent erroneous data when the first CCW in the chain is a
RESERVE, the track field is set to a flag value of X'FF' unless
a valid seek CCW is the first CCW in the chain.

We wrote our own data reduction program which gives us an
accurate picture of the most active VSE packs, cylinders, and
tracks.  This small mod plays a large part in improving our
utilization of DASD.

File DMKMON POLSKTRK contains the mod; in order to add
it to DMKMON the following record must be added to
DMKMON AUXSP (or local AUX file):

POLSKTRK LCL CHANGE 'MN700DIR' FROM DIRECTION TO SEEK TRACK NUMBER

DMKMON POLSKTRK
