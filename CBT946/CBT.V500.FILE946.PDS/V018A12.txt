 Performance hints and tips
The MINWS (Minimum Working Set Size) value can have a dramatic effect on
response times and work throughput.  MINWS parameter controls the minimum
allocated working set size, either for one particular virtual machine, or system
wide.  A high system-wide MINWS will reduce page faults for users and demand
paging, and increase swapping.  A high MINWS may have a negative effect if lots
of users are logged-on.  The relationship between working set and real storage
required can be found by using the following formula:

STORAGE NEEDED FOR USERS = NUMBER OF USERS * AVERAGE WORKING SET
