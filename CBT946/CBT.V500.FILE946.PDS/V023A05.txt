 Controlling RSCS printers
At times, remote-site printers need to be flushed or backspaced.  To do this
usually requires CP commands such as the following:
     'SM RSCS QUERY PRT1 ACTIVE' - to display the active print-out
     SM RSCS FLUSH PRT FILENO' - to flush the active print-out
If you are in a hurry the above can be slow.  The following program will show
all active print-outs on all remote-site printers.  Beside each file, the option
'F' or 'T' can be keyed next to one or more files.
Figure 1 is a sample of what the command screen looks like:

There are two programs; the first is the EXEC, the second is the XEDIT profile.
