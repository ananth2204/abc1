Accessing Mode 0 files in SP Release 5

The October 1986 issue of VM Update included an article by
Jeffrey Lee on the subject of accessing A0 files.  As he
mentioned, it is often necessary, when linking to a mini-disk in
read/only mode, to be able to access mode 0 files.  The solution
presented by Mr Lee was a zap to a private copy of the access
module.

In VM/SP Release 5 this solution does not work, as accessing is
now performed by modules in the CMS nucleus.  This means that,
if we still want the access capability, it will be available to all
CMS users.

At our installation we decided to do away with IBM's 'private'
characteristic of mode 0, so that mode 0 becomes equivalent to
mode 1 (just as 2 and 5 already are).  The reasons for this are
mostly that today's ACI (Access Control Interface) gives much
more control over the link to begin with, reducing the need to
'hide' private files, and the fact that mode 0 never worked anyway,
since copying to a        R/W TDISK allowed all files to be seen.

The modification was effected by making two small changes to
CMS.  Using XEDIT, either add to or create the files DMSACF
AUXSP and DMSACG AUXSP.  If the files exist, the line being
added must be the top line, as follows:
    POLACM0 LCL ALLOW ACCESS OF M0 FILES ON ANY LINK MODE
Build these two update files DMSACF POLACM0 and DMSACG
POLACM0 as follows:


DMSACF POLACM0

./ I 05900000        $ 5905000 5000                  12/12/88 20:47:40
         B     IGNM0             IGNORE M0 CHECKING           %POLACM0
./ I 05910000        $ 5915000 5000                  12/12/88 20:47:40
IGNM0    DS    0H                                             %POLACM0

Note: This change inserts the B IGNM0 statement immediately
after the CLI statement at label CHKMOD, effectively cancelling
the following statement, which was a BE LAR7 for mode 0 files.
The new label, IGNM0 is inserted immediately following the
BE LAR7 just mentioned.


DMSACG POLACM0

./ I 06300000        $ 6302000 2000                  12/15/88 19:13:20
* SKIP THIS CHECK FOR MODE 0 FILES, AND ALLOW                 %POLACM0
* ALL FILE MODES TO BE SEEN.                                  %POLACM0
        B     IGNM0               IGNORE MODE 0 CHECK         %POLACM0
./ I 06320000        $ 6325000 5000                  12/15/88 19:13:20
IGNM0   DS    0H                                              %POLACM0

Note: This change inserts the B IGNM0 statement immediately
above the CLI FSTFMODE+1,C'0' statement, which is a few lines
after the label FSTLOOP.  The new label IGNM0 is inserted two
lines later, following the BE FSTLOOP statement, which would
have checked the result of the CLI.

If you prefer not to tamper with IBM's AUX files (quite a good
idea, since they are updated at each PUT), you can create a local
CNTRL file with an additional filetype above the TEXT AUXSP
line, for example:
    LCL AUXLCL
Then build DMSACF AUXLCL and DMSACG AUXLCL as
shown above.  When you assemble (using VMFASM), you will
get files of type TXTLCL.  Make sure you use the same control
file for VMFLOAD, or these TXT files will not be in the CMS
nucleus.
