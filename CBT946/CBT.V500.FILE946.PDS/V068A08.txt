RDR search EXEC

If you frequently need to find listings 'borrowed' from
colleagues' RDRs, you might try using this simple EXEC. It
executes in any class A machine and results in an XEDIT
session for a  CMS file containing all of the data delivered by
the QUERY RDR ALL command. After sorting these records
by OWNERIDs, the editor helps you locate the whereabouts of
'lost' reports by means of the LOCATE and FIND commands
in conjunction with the ZONE command.

Note: because it uses your machine's PRT and RDR queues,
you might have to use a class other than  T in the TRANSFER
and ORDER commands according to your installation's
standards.
