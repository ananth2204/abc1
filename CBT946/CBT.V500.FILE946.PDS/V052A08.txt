Reader's letter

The June issue of VM Update contained an article entitled
LEAVE option for VM/XA DETACH command.  A few days
ago I had to implement the command in our VM/XA SP 2.1
SL201 system.  The way described in that issue must be
changed as a result of a new VM/XA release.  Fixes for the
module HCPDTC remain unchanged.

Insert the following lines in the module HCPDTD:

      CLI   X'1F'(R8),X'FF'      was LEAVE option entered ?
      BNE   DTDREWUL             no, branch to rew/unload
      MVI   X'1F'(R8),X'FF'      reset flag
      B     DTDUNASN             bypass rew/unload

The lines must be inserted after:
      TM    RDEVTPFG,RDEVNOAS    see if attached is noassign
      BO    DTDUNASN             if so, bypass rewind unload
