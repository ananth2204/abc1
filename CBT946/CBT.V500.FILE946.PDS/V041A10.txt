Other books on IBM Assembler

In issue 35 we printed a question from Nalendro Wibowo of
Unocal asking for information about any books covering VM/SP
Assembler in detail.  Andy Schmidt from the US suggested that
Nalendro should look in the IBM reference manual OS/VS-
DOS/VSE-VM/370 Assembler Language (GC33-4010), or
System/370 Principle of Operation (GA22-7000).  Some of the
books that cover Assembler programming (in addition to the one
reviewed above) are :
