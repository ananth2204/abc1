Reader's letter

In reply to the item on the bulletin board about showing the
amount of storage available in a CMS machine, the following
might be of use.

DMSFREE determines whether it can honour a storage request
by checking FREELOWE and MAINHIGH in the CMS
nucleus.  FREELOWE in the nucleus is the current free user
storage low extend pointer.  FREELOWE drops as storage is
allocated, but cannot drop lower than MAINHIGH.  The
difference between the two values is the available free user
storage.

QFUS (Query Free User Storage) EXEC returns the available
free user storage measured in Kbytes.

/* */
trace off
"EXECIO 1 CP (STRING DISPLAY 510.8"
pull . MAINHIGH FREELOWE .
exit trunc((x2d(freelowe)-x2d(mainhigh))/1024)

Alternatively, it can be written as an Assembler routine.
