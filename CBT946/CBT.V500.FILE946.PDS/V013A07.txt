 Maintaining VTAM in a VM/GCS environment

This procedure outlines a method of maintaining VTAM-related files (VTAMLST, USS
and logmode tables, etc) safely in multiple-write mode.

VM/SP offers no method of enqueue to preserve CMS files when edited in
'multiple-write' (MW) mode.  However, if VTAM files are to be maintained while
VTAM is up, there is no choice but to open these files on a MW-linked disk.
Disk corruption will occur if two users (ie VTAM and MAINT) both attempt to
write at the same time.

This writer knows of one case (there may be more) where VTAM will write to its
191 disk:  when the start-up parameter for tuning statistics (TUNSTAT) is turned
on.  (VTAM will write pseudo-SMF records to a CMS file on its A disk in this
instance.)

IBM suggests keeping the various VTAM files on the MAINT 298 disk.  Further, the
VTAM directory entry links to this disk as its own 191.  This is dangerous.
Instead, the VTAM machine's directory entry should contain an MDISK statement
for a 191 and no link to the MAINT 298.

Place the following PROFILE GCS (note:  not a PROFILE EXEC;  CMS is not IPL'd by
VTAM) on VTAM's 191 mini-disk:

     &TRACE OFF
     CP LINK MAINT 298 298 RR
     ACCESS 298 B/A
     EXEC VMVTAM (00)

The EXEC VMVTAM (00) is used to invoke the VTAM start-up GCS file stored on
MAINT 298.

Place the following statements in the PROFILE EXEC used by MAINT:

     CP LINK MAINT 298 298 MW
     ACCESS 298 V

Filemode V is arbitrary.

When you have finished editing VTAM definition files on the MAINT 298, have VTAM
re-access its read-only extension before implementing your changes, ie:

     SMSG VTAM ACCESS 298 B/A
     SMSG VTAM VTAM V NET,INACT,ID=MAJNODE
     SMSG VTAM VTAM V NET,ACT,ID=MAJNODE
