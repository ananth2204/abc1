 Readers letters
When reading an article entitled A VM news bulletin utility program (which
applies mods to a system) in VM Update  issue 13, I feel the following piece of
information should be taken into account.  As a result of this, sites may wish
to avoid applying any non-IBM modifications to VM.
Shell NZ Holdings Limited recently applied VM PUT8703.  In calling for the
reach-ahead service, we encountered one PTF which IBM would ship in object-code
only format (OCO).  The specific PTF is VM28104  (for CMS), but the problem will
also occur if one tries to recompile DMSHLL in that some of the fixes supposedly
on the module are OCO, ie there are no source PTF files.  We have been advised
that VM release 5 is being provided as OCO, but were surprised that release 4 is
too.  The reply from IBM is, "that is how you will get them from now on".
In the light of this, it would seem inadvisable for any site to apply any home-
grown fixes to VM any more, and for any already on the system to be removed or
implemented another way as soon as possible.
