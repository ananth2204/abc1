Reader's letter

There is a new CP function available at SLU 511, as part of the
Terminal Usability Enhancement, that is so useful I thought it
should be publicised.  It is RETRIEVE FORWARD.

It used to drive me crazy when I retrieved backwards through a
dozen commands only to pass the one I was looking for.  Now, by
having a PF key set to RETRIEVE FORWARD, I need only press
it once to get back to the command that I just passed.  In other
words, it retrieves in the opposite direction to the traditional
retrieve (BACKWARD).

I use it by setting PF12 to RETRIEVE (BACKWARD is the
default), and PF24 to RETRIEVE FORWARD for quick toggling
between the two.  This function is not supported in full-screen
CMS via the SET CMSPF command.
