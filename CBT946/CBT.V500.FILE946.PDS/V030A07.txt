 Boxcopy
Use the BOXCOPY macro to copy a section of a file to another location in the
file.  This permits you to copy selected columns and rows.  The area where the
information is to be copied to will be replaced by the new information.
The format of the BOXCOPY macro is:
----------------------------------------------------------------------
|            |                                                       |
|  BOXCOPY   |                                                       |
|            |                                                       |
----------------------------------------------------------------------
USAGE NOTES
The BOXCOPY command works best when it is defined on a PF key.  The following
command will place the BOXCOPY command on the PF5 key:
     SET PF5 BOXCOPY
The command is used with the cursor.  While looking at the information to be
copied imagine it being encompassed by a box.  Place the cursor on the upper
left-hand corner and press the BOXCOPY key.  Next, place the cursor on the lower
right-hand corner of the imaginary box and press the BOXCOPY key.  Finally,
place the cursor on the upper left-hand corner of the new area to where the
information is to be copied and press the BOXCOPY key once more.  The
information should now be copied.  Please note that the zone affects BOXCOPY's
ability to change lines.  You should not insert lines or move them while BOXCOPY
is only partially completed or BOXCOPY may copy lines different from those you
had originally defined.  If the cursor is in an invalid location (such as the
command line or the prefix area) BOXCOPY generates an error and you will have to
start again.  This can be used to clear BOXCOPY if you make an error or pressed
the BOXCOPY key by mistake.
Example: suppose you had a data file and wanted to copy the second column into
the fourth column but shifted down one line.
y    First, place the cursor on the 2 of the number 234 and press PF5.
y    Second, place the cursor on the 9 of the number 789 and press PF5.
y    Third, place the cursor 2 spaces over from 456 and press PF5.
    123 234 345
    233 345 456
    345 455 567
    454 567 678
    678 789 890
The result will be as follows:
    123 234 345
    233 345 456 234
    345 455 567 345
    454 567 678 455
    678 789 890 567
                789
Error condition: If you place the cursor in a position on the screen that is not
in the file an error message will tell you to start the command again.  This
could occur if the cursor were on the command line, in the prefix area, or after
the end of file line.
