Performance hints and tips
With VM/XA SP the SET SRM STORBUF command allows you to specify what proportion
of storage is available to all classes of user (Ql, Q2, and Q3), the upper limit
of usage by Q2 plus Q3 users, and the maximum available to Q3 users only.  This
command can be used to control paging rates.  If paging rates are low and IND Q
shows users in the eligible list (Ex), you can consider overcommitting main
storage with the first parameter over 100%.
