Assembler Language Programming for the IBM 370 is a very
large and very thorough text-book.  It is divided up into 18
chapters and has nine appendices.  The chapters are divided into
sections and also contain summaries of the information presented,
examples of what is being described, and problems and exercises
for the reader to carry out to test that they have learned what they
have read.

The chapters take the reader from an introduction to System/370
number systems, through various aspects of the Assembler
language, to I/O under OS and VSE.  In the process the book
covers topics such as loops, arrays, integer instructions, character
manipulation, multiple base registers, subprograms and data
areas, macro definitions and conditional Assembly language.

The book covers almost every aspect of IBM mainframe
Assembler programming and the author must be congratulated on
its thoroughness.  The text-book approach gives readers lots of
opportunities to test their understanding of the material presented
by doing the exercises available.  In addition, the book provides
help in the form of debugging hints and a guide to good
programming style.

Although the primary audience for this book must be trainee
systems programmers, it would make a useful addition to the
library at any site that needed to supplement the IBM manuals
with an extra source of reference.
