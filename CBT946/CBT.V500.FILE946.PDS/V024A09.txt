 Reader's letter
In the May issue of VM Update you published an article entitled SELCOPY under
CMS, which contained a few inaccuracies.
Firstly, the author stated that, "All assignments and input/output files must be
declared using the CMS FILEDEF command when the SELCOPY routine executes".  This
isn't exactly true; CMS files can be accessed in three ways: the first is via
the FILEDEF statements; the second by supplying the CMS filename filetype and
filemode to SELCOPY as a single word by separating the three-part name with
full-stops, eg READ PROFILE.EXEC.A; lastly, by delimiting the three-part name
with blanks and enclosing the whole thing in quotes, eg READ 'PROFILE EXEC A'.
Secondly, the author stated that, "The Sysprint assignment, although valid, is
only useful if you execute just one SELCOPY EXEC from within your CMS EXEC.  If
you execute more than one, your listings will be overwritten!"  If a different
FILEDEF for writing SYSPRINT to a different CMS FILENAME is used between each
execution of Selcopy this problem would not exist, eg:
      -SELCOPY1
      FILEDEF SYSPRINT DISK SELCOPY1 LISTING A
      &BEGSTAK -ENDSEL1
         selcopy statements.
            .
            .
      -ENDSEL1
      &STACK
      SELCOPY
      -SELCOPY2
      FILEDEF SYSPRINT DISK SELCOPY2 LISTING A
      &BEGSTACK -ENDSEL2
         selcopy statements.
            .
            .
      -ENDSEL2
      &STACK
      SELCOPY
Finally I find the author's comments on the Selcopy manual as being "inadequate"
surprising.  I don't know what manual he is reading; my manual (Rel 6.00) covers
practically everything you need to know about VM/CMS Selcopy processing.
Basically, if you know how to code Selcopies for running in VSE you can write
them in CMS; the manual assumes the reader has adequate knowledge of CMS and CMS
EXEC writing.
