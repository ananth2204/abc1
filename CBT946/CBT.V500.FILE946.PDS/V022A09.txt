 Displaying PF key settings via REXX
At our installation we have four people maintaining the systems software for our
VM/VSE systems.  We use CMS as the main vehicle for support, and in addition to
our own CMS machines we have various sign-ons devoted to the different areas of
support, VM, VSE, CICS, DL/I, etc.  Usually these general support machines are
used by whoever has responsibility for the area concerned.
Like systems programmers everywhere each of us has tailored our own CMS profiles
in a highly individualistic manner, and this usually is no problem.
Difficulties arise, however, when someone else is using one of the communal
support machines and  PF keys do not perform the expected function.  Here is a
little REXX EXEC  that we put together one day to assist us with this problem.
The EXEC issues a CP QUERY PF command, via the REXX DIAGNOSE function, obtaining
the response in a REXX variable.  The end of line characters (X'15') are
replaced with ' \ ', then the PARSE command is used to extract the setting for
each PF key.  Only the first 40 bytes of each PF key command are shown, thus
allowing 24 PF keys to be displayed on an 80 character wide screen.  This is
shown in Figure 1.
This EXEC has proved so useful that we have placed it on one of our library
mini-disks, and it now appears as the final command in most of the PROFILE EXECs
on the system.
