Extra security on passwords

There appear to be no restrictions in the VM directory upon the
valid characters you can use for a password. This means that
characters may be put into a password which cannot be entered
at a terminal, thus forcing LINKs to be made via EXECs and
stopping service machines from being logged on at a screen.

The simplest way to put a character such as X'FE' into a
password is to enter a mini-disk password as RPASS? (for
example) and use:

      SET HEX ON
      C/?/X'FE'

An EXEC to make the link could then use:

      'CP LINK SOMEUSER 191 199 RR RPASS'x2c('FE')

In order to keep the password (fairly) secret in a shared EXEC
you should put the EXEC into the CMSINST shared segment
and not on a shared disk. To prevent anyone from examining
the EXEC by using 'SET EXECTRAC ON' the following
should be put at the start of the EXEC:

      if trace('O')Â¬='N' then address command 'CP LOGOFF'

It is not true to say that a machine with such a LOGON
password can only be AUTOLOGed. It is possible to define a
TUBES menu with an unenterable password for one of its
sessions. Further restrictions can then be imposed by putting
unenterable characters in the TUBES menu name, so that it has
to be STARTed on a particular virtual address and cannot be
signed on manually. I presume that other session managers
have similar facilities.
