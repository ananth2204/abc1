Reader's letter
One of the best EXECs I have seen, namely SEEKMAP in the
March issue of VM Update, had a number of problems as
printed.

o      The ¬ signs did not print.  There were six omissions:
            if vol ¬= volume
            if rc ¬= 0
            if dtype ¬= 'DASD'
            if ¬datatype (int,W) then signal asksize
            if symbol ('seek,cyl') ¬= 'LIT' then
            if substr (y,1,1) ¬= '-' then return ...

o      The label XA was omitted from the routine.  Place 'XA:'
       after the comment:
            /* add 2 hex numbers & return the result        */

o      Delete the two WAITRD lines.

o      There should be a colon after the label SHOW.

Editor's note: the code as published was exactly the same as the
code sent in by its author.  I assume that the hardcopy sent to
us was printed on a printer without a ¬ sign.
