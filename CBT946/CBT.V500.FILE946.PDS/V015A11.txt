 Performance hints and tips
It is possible to save disk space if there are a number of disconnected virtual
machines that have only a profile EXEC on their A disk.  Provided that they do
not need to write to their A disk it is possible to combine the profile EXECs
into one and save the space occupied by the additional A disks.  One mini-disk
is allocated to hold the profile EXEC.  Each virtual machine has a RO LINK to
this mini-disk at virtual address 191.  IDENTIFY ( STACK LIFO must be put at the
start of the profile EXEC, and a separate EXEC with the name of each diconnected
virtual machine must be placed on the same mini-disk.
