 Performance hints and tips
The VM/XA command SET SRM DSPBUF allows you to put a limit on how many users of
each type will be allowed onto Q at once.  If you have a large number of heavy
users and are I/O rather than storage constrained, overall throughput may be
improved by using DSPBUF to limit the number of concurrent heavy users.
