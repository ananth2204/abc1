 LOGMSG EXEC
A few days ago we had a problem.  Our service engineer wanted to repair our tape
unit during the normal office time.  He was in a hurry and asked the operator to
set one long log message.  The operator did not know how to do that, so I asked
his superior who, within 20 minutes, produced the following REXX program, which
will produce a log message easily.
LOGMSG EXEC
/* One small logmsg REXX program */
/*     Must have CP class B      */
XEDIT CURRENT LOGMSG ' (W 76'
CP SET LOGMSG NULL
I = 1
EXECIO '1 DISKR CURRENT LOGMSG *'
do while RC = 0
     parse pull line
     CP SET LOGMSG I LINE
     I = I + 1
     EXECIO '1 DISKR CURRENT LOGMSG A'
end
say 'The current logmsg is set to:';
say ' '
CP QUERY LOGMSG
