 Tape file management
The following are three simple REXX EXECs for VM tape file management.
Information that is stored on tapes can be handled much more easily and
efficiently by utilising these EXECs.  Although the programs are simple and
probably self-documenting, I have included instructions for each.
SCAN
This EXEC is used to display a list of files on a tape.  The format of the
command is:
    SCAN Ý (T|V|E) (16OO|625O) (N|181) ¨
Where:
     T    -    TAPE format
     V    -    VMFPLC2 format
     E         -    Exit the process
     1600 -    1600 BPI tape density
     6250 -    6250 BPI tape density (default)
     n    -    Tape drive number
     181  -    Tape drive 181 (default)
This EXEC may be invoked by either entering all of the parameters, or simply
entering SCAN and allowing the processing to prompt you.  It is very useful when
you have a tape and have no idea what is on it.
Processing is designed such that once the parameters have been entered the tape
contents will be displayed to you before you are prompted to:
     --(R)ewind--(U)nload--(A)bort--
     --or 'enter' to continue scan--
Thus, to rewind the tape to load point, enter an 'R'.  If you wish the tape to
unload, enter a 'U'; if you want to terminate processing right here, enter an
'A'.  However, if you wish to see what else is on the tape, just press the ENTER
key.  Processing will continue in this loop until the prompt has been satisfied.
If you attempt to read a tape in a format other than the one used to create it,
an error message will be received telling you that it is an invalid record
format.  Issue the command once again, this time specifying the other tape
format.  When you have reached the end of file on tape, the message "end-of-tape
or tape mark found" will be displayed.  If this message is encountered
immediately after issuing the SCAN command, that signifies that there are no
more files on that tape.

/* This EXEC will list files contained on a tape if created by
 'VMFPLC2' or TAPE command                                      */

IF REPLY = U THEN "TAPE RUN ("DRIVE
SNATCH
The SNATCH EXEC is designed to assist in moving files from tape to disk.  If you
need to restore a file from the tape, have the tape loaded, with the drive
attached to your VM machine, and enter the command in the following format:
    SNATCH Ý fn ft fm (T|V|E) (16OO|625O) (n|181) ¨
Where:
     fn        -    The filename to be restored (default '*').
     ft        -    The filetype to be restored (default '*').
     fm        -    The filemode to be restored (default 'A').
     T         -    TAPE format
     V         -    VMFPLC2 format
     E         -    Exit the process
     1600      -    1600 BPI tape density
     6250      -    6250 BPI tape density (default)
     n         -    Tape drive number
     181       -    Tape drive 181 (default)
This EXEC may be invoked by either entering all of the parameters, or simply
entering SNATCH and allowing the processing to prompt you.  This EXEC is widely
used when you have a file or files to restore from tape.
Processing is designed such that when the end of file or end of tape is
encountered, the user is prompted:
     File loaded --(Y)es--(N)o--(M)ore--(A)bort-- ?
A null response is treated like a No.  If the file(s) has been loaded, respond
with a 'Y' and the next prompt will appear; if the file(s) has not been loaded,
but you wish to try loading from the next physical file on the tape, respond
with an 'N', or just press ENTER.  The EXEC will then attempt to load the same
file(s) as previously specified.  If there are more files on this physical
volume that you wish to process, and do not wish to re-position the tape,
respond with an 'M'; if you wish processing to terminate, respond with an 'A'.
After the file(s) has been loaded, and a 'Y' response entered, you will be
prompted:
     TAPE FUNCTION --(R)ewind--(U)nload-- ?
If you enter an 'R' the tape will rewind to load point; if a 'U' is entered, the
tape will be unloaded from the drive; if a null is entered, the tape will remain
in its current location.
If you attempt to read a tape in a format other than the one used to create it,
an error message telling you that it is an invalid record format will be
received.  Issue the command once again, this time specifying the other tape
format.  When you have reached the end of file on tape, the message "end-of-tape
or tape mark found" will be displayed.  If this message is encountered
immediately after issuing the SNATCH command, that signifies that there are no
more files on that tape.

END
OFFLOAD
The OFFLOAD EXEC is used where files are to be moved from the disk onto a tape.
This is similar to the SNATCH EXEC, but in reverse.  The format of the command
is:
    OFFLOAD Ý fn ft fm (T|V|E) (16OO|625O) (n|181) ¨
Where:
     fn        -    The filename to be restored
     ft        -    The filetype to be restored
     fm        -    The filemode to be restored
     T         -    TAPE format
     V         -    VMFPLC2 format
     E         -    Exit the process
     1600      -    1600 BPI tape density
     6250      -    6250 BPI tape density (default)
     n         -    Tape drive number
     181       - Tape drive 181 (default)
This EXEC may be invoked by either entering all of the parameters, or simply
entering OFFLOAD and allowing the processing to prompt you.  This EXEC is widely
used when you have a file or files to load onto tape.
Processing is designed such that when the end of the tape load process or error
occurs, the user is prompted:
     File loaded --(Y)es--(N)o--(M)ore--(A)bort-- ?
A null response is treated like a No.  If the file(s) has been loaded, respond
with a 'Y' and the next prompt will appear; if the file(s) has not been loaded,
respond with an 'N', or just press ENTER.  The EXEC will then attempt to load
the same file(s) as previously specified.  If there are more files that you wish

 to load onto this same physical volume but as a separate file, respond with an
'M'; if you wish processing to terminate, respond with an 'A'.
After files have been off-loaded onto tape, and the user prompt has been
answered, if a 'Y' was entered, 17 trailing tape marks are added to the end of
the file.  If more files are to be added onto the physical volume, then a single
tape mark is added and the EXEC is ended.  After all files have been added to
the tape, and the 17 tape marks are added to the tape, you will be prompted:
     TAPE FUNCTION --(R)ewind--(U)nload-- ?
If you enter an 'R' the tape will rewind to load point; if a 'U' is entered, the
tape will be unloaded from the drive; if a null is entered, the tape will remain
in its current location.
