Modifying mode search -revisited

Having read the article Modifying the mode search order published in issue 12 of
VM Update, I found that we do have the need for such a tool.  The problem that I
had with Rick Frye's solution is one that many others may have encountered.
Being a systems programmer, one tends to have a large collection of 'valuable'
items stored on one's A-disk (I am often running at 90 to 95% full).  The 'ODSK
EXEC' solution would not help me in most cases.  Even a 'neat' programmer, with
a very clean A-disk, would experience problems when working with very large
EXECs.

A solution I found is the EXECLOAD command with the PUSH option.  This allows me
to override all disks accessed (memory is checked before disks) and to override
(without removing) any EXECs already in memory with the same name.  The PUSH
option specifies that the EXEC is loaded even if an EXEC by the same name
already exists in storage.  This loaded EXEC does not replace the existing EXEC.
Subsequent invocation of this EXECname and EXECtype executes the most recently
loaded version.  Also, a subsequent EXECDROP of this EXECname and EXECtype drops
the most recently loaded version.  Another option allows you to specify whether
to load the EXEC into user or system virtual storage.

The attached code is a sample of how one may implement such a tool.  The
parameters you pass to it include: filename, filetype, filemode, and the option
of placing it in system virtual storage.  The EXEC loads the program, runs it,
and drops it from memory upon completion.

I realise that there are problems with this solution as well.  You must be
running VM/SP Release 4 or above and the EXECLOAD command will only work with
EXECs and System Product Editor (XEDIT) macros.

/* will load programs passed as fn,ft,& fm into memory and run it */
PARSE ARG fn ft fm '(' storage
option = 'USER'
storage = STRIP(storage)
IF storage ¬= '' & storage ¬= 'SY' & storage ¬= 'SYSTEM' THEN DO
   EXECIO '1 EMSG (STRING ELFOVE001E Invalid option' storage'. Try'  ,
           'again.'
   EXIT 1
   END
IF storage = 'SY' | storage = 'SYSTEM' THEN option = 'SYSTEM'
'EXECLOAD' fn ft fm '(PUSH' option
lastrc = RC
IF lastrc = 104 THEN DO
   EXECIO '1 EMSG (STRING ELFOVE002E There is not enough virtual'  ,
         'storage available to load program.  Increase and try again.'
   EXIT 2
   END
IF lastrc ¬= 0 THEN DO
   EXECIO '1 EMSG (STRING ELFOVE003E Problem loading program. RC =' ,
           lastrc
   EXIT 3
   END

'EXECDROP' fn ft '('option

IF lastrc ¬= 0 THEN DO
   EXECIO '1 EMSG (STRING ELFOVE004E Problem removing program from' ,
           'virtual storage.  RC = 'lastrc
   EXIT 4
   END
EXIT 0
