Sam,



We have found a couple of bugs and fixed them in the latest
version of the Shared Spool Mods for jes2.  I have included a
new xmi file to replace the previous one.

You had posted the previous distribution as file#766 in the CBT
Tape pre-release Updates section.

Thanks for continuing to maintain the CBTTAPE web site!


Regards,
Stephen McColley
