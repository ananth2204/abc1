Mr. Golob,

  I have included an XMIT format file for the new version of the
  Mellon Shared Spool Mods.  We are currently running with them
  on 1.7, and have tested successfully under 1.8, no changes
  other than a reassembly to go from 1.7 to 1.8.

  We have decided, since we have been maintaining the mods for a
  dozen of so years now, to drop the MELLON part of the MELLON
  SHARED SPOOL MODS, and simply refer to them as the SHARED SPOOL
  MODS.  We do of course still acknowledge Mellon for their
  earlier contribution.

  This version of the Shared Spool Mods provides quite a few new
  features including TIME cards that can be used to keep a job
  from executing until a certain time of day, or certain length
  of time has passed.  Included in the package we now have three
  documents, an installation doc, a users guide, and an
  operations guide.  We also added features that can be used to
  limit the number of jobs that can execute in each class on the
  LPAR level.  We had to have this feature to handle WLM managed
  inits the way we wanted to locally, although the feature works
  for normal JES2 inits as well as WLM managed inits, and lots
  more - all in the documentation members.

  Included in the XMIT file are the following members -

  @@README - basic info about the package, documentation
             location, and organization.

  DISCL & DISCLAIM - our basic disclaimer text in different
             formats.

  JES2PARM - sample JES2 parms to use with the shared spool mods.

  LSES500  - The usermod that contains all of the Shared Spool
             Mods.  I repackaged them into a single usermod.

  LSES500J - A sample SMPE job to receive and apply the usermod
             for LSES500 - the Shared Spool Mods.

  SSMINSTP - The installation documentation in PDF format.

  SSMINSTW -  The installation documentation in WORD format.

  SSMOPSGP - The operations guide in PDF format.

  SSMOPSGW - The operations guide in WORD format.

  SSMUSERP - The users guide in PDF format.

  SSMUSERW - The users guide in WORD format.

--- The following members are not really part of our Shared Spool
      Mods, but are used by some folks ---

 STSCX01A - Our old exit01a - page separator exit.

 STSCX05B - This exit prevents purging jobs by range.

 STSCX15A - Which forces FCB reloads unless the FCB is for
            standard forms.

 STSCX36A - Which is a SAF exit to propagate userids for RJE/NJE
            jobs.

  If there are any problems or questions, please let me know.

  Thank you again for maintaining the CBT tape web site!

Thanks,
Stephen McColley
