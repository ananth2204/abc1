       Mainframe Software Installation Customizer (MSIC)

You can (in recommendation order):

- use ISPF 3.4 to member list this data set and then use the 'exec' line
  command on the MSIC member

- build a front-end allocation that does: tso exec 'hlq.msic.pds(msic)'
  replace hlq with the prefix of this data set.

- type: tso exec 'hlq.msic.pds(msic)'
  replace hlq with the prefix of this data set.

- Copy MSICR* members to your //SYSEXEC concatenation (or //SYSPROC)
  Copy MSICH* members to your //ISPPLIB concatenation.
  Copy MSICP* members to your //ISPPLIB concatenation.
  Copy MSICT* members to your //ISPPLIB concatenation.
