       Mainframe Software Installation Customizer (MSIC)

This SHAREWARE Tool is a generalized and extensible ISPF Dialog
that aids in installing and customizing the type of SHAREWARE you
might develop and contribute to the CBTTape.Org respository.

You will decide what needs to be done to install and configure
your SHAREWARE and from that you will build #1TASKS for the user
to act upon. Along the way you may have a need for the user to
provide values, e.g. High Level Qualifier and VOLSER, and you
will build #2VARS listing the variable, some simple attributes,
and an initial value. You build #3EDIT to identify which members
variable replacement should act upon.

MSIC has some built-in action types (internal routine) and a few
external action types (separate REXX members). If you need more
than this then you add the external action to your install PDS.

Configuration members:
----------------------
#1TASKS : Identifies the sequence of actions to be performed.
#2VARS  : The variables you use to install and configure your
          SHAREWARE item.
#3EDIT  : A list of members edited with Macro(MSICRMBR) to
          accomplish variable substitution.

Action types:
-------------
Browse  : Let the user BROWSE a PDS member.
Edit    : Let the user EDIT a PDS member.
Execute : Run some external REXX code.
Receive : Receive all XM variables.
Routine : Run an internal REXX routine.
Submit  : Submit a member to run in the background.
View    : Let the user VIEW a PDS member.

Provided external action:
-------------------------
MSICREDT: Reads #3EDIT and invokes EDIT with Macro(MSICRMBR) to
          do variable substitution.
MSICRMBR: Uses table VDEFTABL to do variable substitution.
MSICRSUB: Edit macro to insert INFO and NOTE lines at the top
          of the member to inform the user what to do.

#2VARS variables and values added by MSIC:
------------------------------------------
HOSTDSN1: Added by MSIC; contains the data set name from whence
          MSIC was run from. It is also the ISPPLIB and ALTLIB
          added data set.
HOSTDSN2: Added by MSIC, same as above, minus the apostrophes.
UNIT    : Added by MSIC, the device type the extract data set is on.
VOLSER  : Added by MSIC, the volume the extract data set is on.
ZUSER   : Added by MSIC, the current userid.


DEMO suitable example
---------------------
My DEMO shareware Tool is a good example of how to setup the
#1TASKS, #2VARS, and #3EDIT members.

Building #1TASKS
----------------
*
* Mainframe Software Installation Customizer (MSIC)
*
* Tasks require 2 records.
* Record 1:
* =====================================================================
* Seq    N3 Three digit sequence identifier
* Type   C7 What it is you want to do.
*             Browse : Let the user BROWSE a PDS member.
*             Edit   : Let the user EDIT a PDS member.
*             Execute: Run some external REXX code.
*             Receive: Receive all XM variables.
*             Routine: Run an internal REXX routine.
*             Submit : Submit a member to run in the background.
*             View : Let the user VIEW a PDS member.
* Item   C8 What is acted upon.
* Done   D8 The last attempt date filled in by MSIC.
* Status C2 How that last attempt fared filled in by MSIC.
*
* Record 2:
* =====================================================================
* Desc  : A descriptive bit of text.
*
*---+----1----+----2----+----3----+----4----+----5----+----6----+----7----+----8
*SQ Type    Item     Description goes on a second line               Done     St
*== ======= ======== =============================================== ======== ==

Tips:
-----
- Use the sequence to put things in chronological order.
- Use sequence as a range for similar events.
- Browse, Edit, and View should be used appropriately.
  Browse is read-only.
  View allows editing while denying SAVE.
  Edit allows full editing and saving.
- Use Windows copy and paste of member names to ensure correctness.


Building #2VARS
---------------
*
* Mainframe Software Installation Customizer (MSIC)
*
* Variables require 2 records.
* Record 1:
* =====================================================================
* ITEM         C8 The variable name.
*                 You will wrap it with exclamation marks when used.
* Attribute    C2 Provides for limited validation and identification.
*                   DS = Data set name
*                   LC = Lowercase
*                   MB = Member name
*                   MC = Mixed case (ASIS)
*                   N  = Number (digits)
*                   UC = Uppercase
*                   XM = IDTF member to DSName.
* Length      N2  The maximum size of the value.
* Description C61 Describes what the variable is used for.
*
* Record 2:
* =====================================================================
* The initial default value or the user specified value.
*
*---+----1----+----2----+----3----+----4----+----5----+----6----+----7----+----8
*Item    A  Length Description (value is on the next row).
*======= == ====== =============================================================

Tips:
-----
- Variable replacement using #3EDIT along with MSICREDT and MSICRMBR
  will run through the variables twice, thus you can use a variable
  in a value and have it replaced on the second pass.


Building #3EDIT
---------------
*
* Mainframe Software Installation Customizer
*
* This is a list of members that will undergo variable replacement.
*

Tips:
-----
- List the member names in your install PDS that should undergo
  variable replacement.
- Have a backup copy if you need recoverability.
