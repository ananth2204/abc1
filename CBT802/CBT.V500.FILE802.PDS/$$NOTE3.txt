Hi Sam,

I don't mind giving this program away for free, as I wrote
earlier, I'm not at all interested in keeping the copyright to
the source code.  In fact, as you may have noticed, a couple of
parts were written based on the DELINKI program you already host
so I don't think it would be right to hold Ýfull¨ copyright.

I've attached a zip of my latest build of the obj file, the zip
also contains the latest C code - which I recently changed after
a quick review.  Only a small change, to some tests to see if a
relocation crosses a boundary in the loadmodules text records, I
wasn't checking precise limits before.  It should be good to go
now.

Best regards,
Jason.
