Hello Sam,

I've written a C program that is currently hosted on my "goodies"
page at:

http://61.8.102.183/jcc/

(see the goodies link) that delinks a loadmodule into an object
deck - and it doesn't require the PL/I runtime like the version
you currently have on your site does.

I have no interest in keeping the copyright to the source code
and though you may like to add it to the DELINKI file download so
people who run older OSs on Hercules etc. have the ability to
perform the same function that DELINKI supplies.

I'd also be happy for you to give it a test - it worked for me,
for the limited things I used it for but I'm sure there's
something that isn't handled properly (I'm no expert) and would
be happy to "upgrade" it if someone were to point out where it
needs it.

Best regards,
Jason Winter.
