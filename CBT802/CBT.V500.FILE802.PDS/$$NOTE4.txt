Hi Sam,

Here's a better version (I think) in that it now checks for
something I didn't expect and that shouldn't happen anyway, in
the RLD processing, I've run it over all the files in my
sys1.linklib and didn't see that possible error but who really
knows!

It also has a small change in where the SSI data comes from in
the directory user-data.  I was using an old DELINKI source file
from 2003 which seems to only look at position 22 if the SSI flag
is set - maybe it's been fixed now, or maybe this version of
DELINKC is now wrong?  I'm not really sure.  The original
assembler module that returns the SSI decoded data wasn't, at
least in my old version, as sophisticated at the PL/I source code
that seems to only calculate its position for working out where
the APF data is.  (All a bit dodgy.)

I think I also fixed an offset calculation in DELINKC for
half-word aligning the SSI data in one particular case, which
would effect the APF position calculations I was doing...  I hope
this DELINKC is the last version I need to send you.  I have to
admit, I didn't need any of this stuff for the few things I wrote
my original code for.  I only added it in when I decided to pass
it along to the CBT.

Best regards,
Jason.
