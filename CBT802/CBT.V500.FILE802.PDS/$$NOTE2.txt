Hi Sam,

I'll preempt some answers to questions.

I wrote the JCC compiler 5 years ago, but withdrew the product
due to lack of commercial interest.  I have recently republished
it on the web, but I don't intend to support it for "free" users
like I was doing 5 years ago.  Anybody can use the compiler and
library - for free - as long as the C source code to what is
"released" is also made available.  A license fee would only be
payable when releasing object code without source code, or if a
business is using it internally.

The compiler can produce an object directly, but you need to tell
it where the library include files are, since delink.c is a
"full" program it should be quite easy to get that part done.
The prelinker will resolve library functions and build a complete
object deck using library objects, but you need to tell it where
to find the library objects.  As long as the C source code and
resulting .obj file are kept together, I'll be happy for them to
appear anywhere on the web.

Best regards,
Jason.
