//*     This package contains three programs: RUNAUTH, HOSTCMD      *   FILE 845
//*     and SYSCMD.                                                 *   FILE 845
//*                                                                 *   FILE 845
//*     With the first program, authorized program can be called    *   FILE 845
//*     from un-authorized TSO environment, including CLIST or      *   FILE 845
//*     REXX script, where direct call caused system abend 047.     *   FILE 845
//*     The second program allows execute of host (CP or Hercules)  *   FILE 845
//*     command, passed as a parameter, on z/OS or OS/390.          *   FILE 845
//*     Running both together, CP or Hercules commands can be       *   FILE 845
//*     entered from unauthorized TSO session without any system    *   FILE 845
//*     mods.  Third program SYSCMD allows execute of MVS system    *   FILE 845
//*     commands (MVS console commands) from the program, the       *   FILE 845
//*     same thing as provided by TSO CONSOLE service. This         *   FILE 845
//*     program also can be used together with RUNAUTH to allow     *   FILE 845
//*     to run MVS commands from unauthorized TSO session.          *   FILE 845
//*                                                                 *   FILE 845
