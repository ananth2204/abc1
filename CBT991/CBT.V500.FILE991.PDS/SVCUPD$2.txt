//SBGOLO@$ JOB ,'SAM GOLOB',CLASS=B,
//    MSGCLASS=X,NOTIFY=&SYSUID
//*
//*   You can bypass most of the RACF protections if your
//*   userid is marked as having the RACF SPECIAL attribute,
//*   but you need to put some of the protections into place,
//*   in the RACF database.
//*
//*   But if no RACF protections are defined, and you are SPECIAL,
//*   then you should use the version called SVCUPDTX, which
//*   will allow you to temporarily add an SVC.  This version
//*   bypasses some of the RACF checks, but not all of them.
//*
//*   This job will not end, until you CANCEL or STOP it.  That
//*   is why it has a weird jobname, so it should not make a
//*   "duplicate job name" situation in conflict with other jobs.
