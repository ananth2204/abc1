                                HFSELECT                JCL and PARM   5-1.1


           Ý 1¨  The general form of the PARM field for the program  is  as
                 follows:

                PARM='optionÝsuboptions¨Ý,keytype=»key/classº¨Ý,Y=hexstring¨
                     Ý,B=begin¨Ý,E=end¨Ý,J=»ÝÆ¨count/relation/0º¨
                  Ý,VÝP¨=(l£,p£Ý,l¥,p¥¨Ý,l·,p·¨)¨
                     Ý,L£,P£¨Ý,L¥,P¥¨Ý,L·,P·¨'

                Parameters required by HFSELECT, including the options,  are
           specified in the PARM field and must be entered as shown  in  the
           detailed description of the PARM  field for each  option.  If  no
           PARM is coded, the default, PARM='R,1,1', copies the entire input
           file.

                The  various  parameters  that  may be entered into the PARM
           field are either positional or keyword parameters. If a parameter
           is  not  coded,  the comma associated with that parameter must be
           omitted.  No  blanks are permitted in the PARM except in the key.
           The PARM field may contain up to 100 bytes including  commas  and
           internal parentheses.

                The primary selection options and  suboptions are  described
           briefly in section  5.1  and  5.2  and are described in detail in
           section 7.  The  remainder  of  the  various  PARM parameters are
           described in detail in sections 5.3 through 5.9.

           Ý 4¨  See section 6.1.2.

           Ý 5¨  See section 6.1.1 and also note below for EROPT=.

           Ý 6¨  See section 6.1.3.

           Ý 7¨  This DD statement is required when a dump is desired if the
                 program ABENDS. However, most ABENDS are intercepted by the
                 program and short messages describing the ABEND are printed
                 rather than complete dumps.
