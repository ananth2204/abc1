 To generate the documentation, use the TSO RECEIVE command.

    TSO RECEIVE INDS(this.pds($$DOCS))

 and that will produce the documentation pds in DCF SCRIPT format.

 The output is a pds, as follows:

         RECFM LRECL BLKSIZE
         VBA     148    4096

 which, by default, will be named:  prefix.FILE807.DOCS


 To print the documentation, see member IEBGENER in the File 807 pds.
 You may have to rework the JCL for best results at your site.
