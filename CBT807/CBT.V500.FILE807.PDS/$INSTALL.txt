                       INSTALLATION PROCEDURE

       The following files contain all program materials necessary
  to install the HFSELECT and SUPRDUMP programs. (All files are PDSs)

       This pds is a JCL and source library containing the following:
    - member $README - please read
    - member $INSTALL which you are now reading.
      Please IGNORE the installation chapter in the documentation
      contained in the $$DOCS member.
    - member $INTRO which gives a general overview of the
      capabilities of HFSELECT & SUPRDUMP.
    - member MK11 containing the JCL required to create the character
      set MK11 which is used to print the documentation and must be
      placed into SYS1.IMAGELIB with the name XTB1MK11.  It is invoked
      in JCL via the CHARS=MK11 parameter.  The doc is in the pds
      which was created from the $$DOCS member.
    - member ASMHCL containing the JCL which is used to assemble and
      link-edit all source modules contained in this pds.
    - member MACRO containing the macro IHAQDB required for assembling
      programs HFSELECT and SUPRDUMP.
    - members TESTxxx may be ignored.

  For HFSELECT:
    - the main HFSELECT module (the name 'HFSELECT' may not be
      changed without requisite source module changes)
    - two required subroutines- MKMESSAG and SYNADERR
    - a subroutine module READVTC that is required for the V Option
    - a source module of a modified  version of the public domain
      assembler program SCAN4HIT
    - the CLIST HFSELMSG required for the on-line message dialog
      facility (place in the SYSPROC concatenation of the LOGON PROC)

    - Use the $PDSLOAD job to create the panel and message libraries
      for the HFSELECT message explanation system.

  For SUPRDUMP:
    - the main SUPRDUMP module (must be placed into an APF-authorized
      library)
    - the  CLIST SUPRDMSG required for the on-line message dialog
      facility (place in the SYSPROC concatenation of the LOGON PROC)

    - Use the $PDSLOAD job to create the panel library
      for the SUPRDUMP message explanation system.

       HFSELECT may be placed in any load library unless the use of
  the VTOC form of the V option is desired. If so, the HFSELECT and
  READVTC  (for  the  V  option)  modules  must  be  placed  in  an
  authorized load library.

       The HFSELMSG/SUPRDMSG CLISTs must be modified for the names used
  for the libraries containing the panels and messages.

       Files 2 and 3 contain the panel libraries for HFSELECT/SUPRDUMP
  on-line message dialog facility and file 4 contains a common message
  library for HFSELECT/SUPRDUMP on-line message dialog facility.

       File 5 contains documentation for HFSELECT/SUPRDUMP.  A
  3800-compatible laser printer is required to print the documentation.

       The tape copy feature of SUPRDUMP  is available only if  the
  SAS software product Release 6.07 (distributed  by  SAS Institute
  Inc.,  Cary,  N. C. 27511)  is  installed  on the system. The SAS
  module invoked in SUPRDUMP is SAS370,  the entry module specified
  in the bundled MVS/370 non-LPA configuration of SAS.  This module
  is in the SAS load library.
