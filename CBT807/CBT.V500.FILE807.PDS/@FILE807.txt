//*          HFSELECT performs file or record matching of two       *   FILE 807

//*     The output files may be sequential, VSAM or PDS. Thus       *   FILE 807

//*     Output file LRECLs and BLKSIZEs may differ from their       *   FILE 807

//*          The output files may be directed to any system         *   FILE 807
//*     storage device (tape, disk, etc.), or any or all of the     *   FILE 807
//*     output files may be printed either unformatted, in          *   FILE 807
//*     character, character and HEX format, or character with a    *   FILE 807
//*     ruler line.                                                 *   FILE 807

//*          User exits may be used to modify standard HFSELECT     *   FILE 807
