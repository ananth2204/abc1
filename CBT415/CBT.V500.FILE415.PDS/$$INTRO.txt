RPF - It is not ISPF, but pretty close

Introduction

RPF is a TSO command processor written by Rob Prins, and it is in
some aspects very similar to SPF. Also, while he holds the
copyright to his work, he allows the Hercules community to use
and distribute it. The latest available Version for the Hercules
community is currently RPF Version 1 Release 8 Modification 6

What is new in Release 1.4.2?

Rob has again implemented a few enhacement to increase useability
of his fine program:

   * The possibility the edit data with non-printables. It is not
     a hex edit, but you change the editable data without
     destroying the lines with non printables, so you edit data
     with e.g. object decks. In the former releases all the
     printable data was translated into colons.
   * New inserted lines will be highlighted if they are empty. If
     data is entered in an inserted line the highlighting of that
     line will disappear. The empty inserted lines will not be
     saved or submitted.  This is the way like VM XEDIT it does.
   * The COPY command in EDIT is improved.
   * You can specify the UNIT type in Alloc (option 3.1)
   * RPFSTAT has got a new screen (option 0.0)
   * The 'M' command is supported in the member selection list
     (scroll max).

What was new in Release 1.4.1?

   * Using the END command (PFK3) will now return you to the
     invoking screen, not to the main menu. This is true for
        o Browse (Option 1)
        o Edit (Option 2)
        o PDS Maintenance (Option 3.4)
   * You can now select a member with the 'S member' command in
     the member selection list
   * Check the documentation RPF User's guide or member RPFUGUID
     in the attached source library.

What was new in Release 1.4?

   * A few bug fixes
   * RPFDATAU: Module deleted. Functions moved to RPFDATAL
     RPFDATAL: Dataset selection list implemented. Module will
     also be used for utility functions This list is a history of
     the last edited datasets and will be written in the RPF
     database if RPF exits. No conversion of the database is
     needed. RPF will just write a second record per user.
   * RPFFIND: Find string matches if string is the same and can
     be entered in mixed case
   * RPFPDS: Bug fixed if EDIT invoked and COPY command given
   * RPFMAIN: SMF system id in main menu
   * RPFEDIT: Save the data in the same dataset/member if the END
     subcommand has been given. Save only if the data has been
     changed (the ISPF way)
   * CANCEL command added, with alias CAN to exit EDIT without
     saving the data.
   * RPFLIB LIBRARIAN tape master files supported
   * RPFBRO SUB(MIT) command added in Browse.
   * See the included RPF User's guide or member RPFUGUID in the
     attached source library.

What was new in Release 1.3?

   * A few bug fixes
   * RPFBRO introduced for browsing data RPFBRO has a lot of new
     commands.
   * RPFASM has got a new screen
   * The output of RPFASM will be browsed with RPFBRO and more
     assembles/links can be done without leaving the foreground
     assembler menu.
   * RPFLIB (running librarian implemented) Option 3.5 is
     available. This is nice for people who have masterfiles of
     librarian (a product of ADR, later Computer Associates)
   * RPFOUT output will be browsed with RPFBRO.
   * The maclibs, assembler parm, linkage editor parm control
     statements will be saved in the RPF database

If you are upgrading from RPF 1.2 you should note that the
profile dataset in the new version is not compatible with the old
profile dataset.

Note that while Version 1.3 uses member RPFKEY01 of SYS1.PARMLIB,
Version 1.4 uses member RPFKEY00 (as does Version 1.2)

Please note that the record size of the rpf database has changed
in version 1.3 from (1000 1000) to (1750 1750).

Please note also that the PFK settings have changed. After starting
RPF you should first go to the DEFAULTS menu and set the functions
keys to the value you want

Installation Checklist
-----------------------------------------------------------------

Method 1:

RPF is available as zip file from www.prince-webdesign.nl/rpf
After you have downloaded the file you
should extract it into any directory of your choice. It will
contain the following file:

  1. rpf186.aws - a file containing six datasets

You will find on the same URL the job 'loadjcl.txt'
Check the jcl in 'loadjcl.txt' and adjust it to your needs (read the
comments in 'loadjcl.txt').
Mount the tape on a suitable tape drive via

devinit xxx {inst_dir}rpf186.aws

Run the job below (this is the contents of loadjcl.txt)
//LOADJCL JOB 01,RPF186,CLASS=A,MSGCLASS=A
//STEP01  EXEC PGM=IEBCOPY,REGION=256K
//SYSPRINT DD  SYSOUT=*
//JCLIN    DD  DSN=TAPE.V1R8M6.SRPFJCL,UNIT=TAPE,VOL=SER=RPF186,
//             LABEL=(4,SL),DISP=OLD
//JCLOUT   DD  DSN=RPF.JCLLIB,UNIT=SYSDA,VOL=SER=PUB000,
//             SPACE=(CYL,(1,1,10)),DISP=(NEW,CATLG,DELETE),
//             DCB=SYS1.MACLIB
//SYSIN    DD  *
 COPY INDD=JCLIN,OUTDD=JCLOUT
/*
//
Cut the JCL lines above and paste these lines in a new member and use
the RPF SUB command or TSO SUB command, or use 'loadjcl.txt'.

After obtaining the JCL data set with the above job, run job INSTRPF
to load the RPF data sets.

Note that the installation JCL places the executable modules of
RPF into SYS2.CMDLIB. If you don't want this to happen, change
the IEBCOPY control statements before submitting the job

Method 2:

The file415.xmi file (this file) is mapped different. This file should
be loaded with the hercules DASDLOAD function, with PDSLOAD
of Jim Morrison or a TSO/E RECEIVE INDATASET function after
binary uploading with IND$FILE.

After DASDLOAD and IPLing your OS, please run the job $XMIT370
to copy LOADXMI into a load library. Use the TSO command
RECEIVE INDATASET dsn(LOADXMI) to install the load library.
or use job $XMIT370.
Afterwards you can install, the source library, HELP library
and macro and JCL libraries with job $PDSLOAD.

!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! IMPORTANT !!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
If you use RPF on a MVS 3.8 or MVS380 system copy member
LOADXMIM into a load library, use job $XMIT370 in this data set.
!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! IMPORTANT !!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!

With job CMDLIB in the JCL library, you can copy the RPF load
modules into a LNKLST library like SYS2.CMDLIB.

Note that the RPF load library needs to be accessible via the
master catalog if you want to place the RPF distribution load lib
into the link list

Note: If RPF is installed in an OS/390 or z/OS system, run
      job ASMRPFE to support indexed VTOC's, SMS managed
      data sets like PDS/E and the UCBSCAN in option 9.
      After this job run jobs LKEDRPF and CMDLIB to install
      this support.
      - OR - do a RECEIVE of member LOADXMI.

MVS38J:
It is recommended to install usermods ZP60008 and ZP60009.
ZP60008 and ZP60009 makes larger screens than 1920 bytes (24x80)
possible (support the Erase Write Alternate, EWA and TPUT NOEDIT).
Screensizes can be up to 16384 bytes.
If ZP60008 and ZP60009 are not applied, RPF works well on a standard
24x80 screen.
These usermods can be found on the site of Greg Price
http://www.prycroft6.com.au/vs2mods/index.html.
If running MVS38J TK4- (distributed by Jürgen Winkelmann), ZP60008
and ZP60009 are already applied.

If you are installing RPF for the very first time on MVS38J, check
possibly modify, and run the job in member ZUM0001 in file
SYS1.UMODCNTL to make RPF, RPFMAIN, RPFMVCPY, RPFOUT
and RPFVTOC1 authorized in TSO.
Only the commands (RPF and RPFMAIN) should be specified in
usermod ZUM0001. Before submit of ZUM0001 check the contents
of member IKJEFFTE2 in library SYS1.UMODSRC.
REIPL to activate the usermod ZUM0001, do not forget to specify
the CLPA option at IPL time. This is only necessary if you are
installing RPF for the very first time.
Note that usermod ZUM0001 should be only applied on an MVS system.

MVS/XA or later:
RPF works in 31 bit mode and can have workspace sizes to 1,000,000
records. RPF supports in these Operating Systems 3270 screens up
to 16384 bytes.

Update member IKJTSOxx to specify programs RPF and RPFMAIN in the
AUTHCMD statement.
Activate this member with the command PARMLIB UPDATE(xx).

Logon to TSO and try out RPF.
