                 (Robs's Programming Facility V 1 R 8)


  RPF is developed by Rob Prins for Skybird Systems and used
  in the free MVS38J distributions and all MVS successors.

  It operates as a command processor under TSO/VTAM in a MVS38J,
  MVS/380, MVS/XA, MVS/ESA, OS/390 and z/OS operating system.
  With the exception of MVS38J addressing mode 31 is available, so you
  you can edit datasets or PDS members up to 999,999 lines.

  RPF provides an easy way of entering and editing data on an IBM3270
  terminal.  The major change in Version 1, Release 7 is the size of
  of the 3270 terminal. All the panels will support screens up
  16384 bytes.

  It also provides you with the ability of ASSEMBLE and
  LINK-EDIT programs in the FOREGROUND. The UTILITY has functions for
  creation and deletion of data sets, EDITing a VTOC, PDS, LIBRARIAN
  and ARCHIVER maintenance and the dataset list function.

  Editing of numbered or unnumbered data sets or PDS(E) members
  with a record format of FIXED or VARIABLE and a record length
  varying from 40 to 255 is possible.

  For a description of all commands, select 2 on the RPF Help
  menu (RPF option 7.2)

  The RPF editor supports numbered and unnumbered data if the
  data contains fixed records. Variable records are always
  unnumbered. Normally the line numbers are placed in the last
  8 columns of the data. An exception is COBOL source data.
  COBOL source does have the line numbers in columns 1-6.
  If the data contains line numbers in columns 1-6 and the record
  length is 80, COBOL will be automatically detected.
  If the COBOL source is not detected, the COB command wil give
  you the solution.

  If a file is edited, the workspace is automatically cleared.
  If you want to append another file, issue the APPEND subcommand
  in EDIT.
  Normal OS datasets (PDS or sequential), LIBRARIAN datasets and
  PANVALET datasets can be processed with EDIT.  All files are
  allocated dynamically. If an error occurs during dynamic allocation, a
  return code is displayed. Select 3 on the HELP MENU to get an
  explanation of the return codes.
  RPF also does contain an ARCHIVER interface (file 147 on
  www.cbttape.org) to process an Archive or to save in an
  Archive.

  The TEST function is implemented only for maintanance by the RPF
  BUILDERS and should not be used by unauthorized users.

  In each selection menu, the 'END' PFkey is supported (PF3 and PF15).

  RPF OPERATOR MODE enables you to look at the current system activity.
  When using RPFOPER, enter 'HELP' to list the available functions.

  RPF works in fullscreen mode, which means that the terminal is also
  set to fullscreen mode. If a non-fullscreen message (like a SEND
  message) is received three *** appear on the screen. Hit the Enter key
  to restore your screen.  If the screen is not properly restored, enter
  a '?' to restore.

  The use of PFK's is possible during EDIT, BROWSE, PDS, Data set
  selection list, LIBRARIAN functions, PANVALET functions, ARCHIVER
  functions and all selection menus.
  These PFK's can be altered by using the DEFAULTS menu
  This defaults menu is option '0' on the main menu.
  With this menu it is possible to alter the default workspace size,
  allocation of OS, LIBRARIAN, Panvalet and ARCHIVER data sets and
  the mentioned PFK's

  All these defaults will be saved on the RPF profile cluster if
  available.
