//***FILE 848 is from Sam Bass and is a re-introduction of the      *   FILE 848
//*           LIBSPOOL package (which once was on this tape) to     *   FILE 848
//*           the CBT collection.  LIBSPOOL is an adaptation of     *   FILE 848
//*           PANSPOOL, except it is for CA-Librarian instead of    *   FILE 848
//*           for CA-Panvalet.  Sam Bass did the original work      *   FILE 848
//*           of the adaptation.  So here it is.                    *   FILE 848
//*                                                                 *   FILE 848
//*           email:  Sam.Bass@mclaneco.com                         *   FILE 848
//*                                                                 *   FILE 848
