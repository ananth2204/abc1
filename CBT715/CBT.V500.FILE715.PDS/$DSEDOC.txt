SHORT DESCRIPTION (FOR INCLUSION ON THE INDEX OF THE MVSMOD TAPE)
*
PROGRAMM TO ERASE A TAPE STARTING AFTER A GIVEN DATASET UNTIL IT
REACHES THE REFLECTIVE SPOT, THEREAFTER IT WRITES SOME ERASE GAPS
TO BE 200 PERCENT SURE.
THIS PROGRAMM HANDLES SL AND NL TAPES, AND USES THE DATA-SECURITY-
ERASE HARDWARE COMMAND TO DO THE JOB. NO CHANNEL BUSY, NO CPU-BUSY
MERELY THE CONTROL UNIT IS BUSY.
*
************************************************************************
*
LONGER DESCRIPTION
*
WITH THIS PROGRAMM YOU CAN ERASE BOTH SL AND NL TAPES.
ALL YOU HAVE TO DO IS SUPPLY THE LAST DATASET NAME THAT
SHOULD REMAIN ON THE VOLUME.
*
THE PROGRAMM HANDLES ALL POSSIBLE CONDITIONS F.I.
   IT CHECKS THAT THERE IS A FILE-PROTECT RING ON THE TAPE
   IT CHECKS THE CONDITION THAT THE FILE ALREADY REACHED THE
             REFLECTIVE SPOT
*
NORMAL OPERATION FOR A MULTI-VOLUME DATASET IS THAT THE
PROGRAMM TAKES THE LAST VOLUME AND ERASES IT,
YOU CAN SUPPLY A PARM VALUE OF 'H', IN THAT CASE THE PROGRAMM
TAKES EVERY VOLUME OF A MULTI-VOLUME DATASET AND ERASES IT,
THIS WAS TO HANDLE A SITUATION IN OUR INSTALLATION WHERE A
PROGRAMM HAD TO WRITE A GIVEN AMOUNT OF BLOCKS ON EVERY SINGLE
REEL OF A MULTI-VOLUME DATASET AND THEN SWITCHED THE VOLUME
USING FORCED-END-OF-VOLUME.
