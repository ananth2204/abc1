Glenn,

Thank you for a superior MPFXTALL!  I have been using Murray Nicholas' for
some time and have written a reply interface similar to it.

The copy I have attached to this e-mail contains updates which include
corrections for re-entrant CALL problem caught by the assembler and
cleaning up some other miscellaneous error messages during assembly.

I have taken the 'issued by' a step further to include the message number
causing the command/reply to be issued.  For replies this does require
single quotes to be added around the REPLY in the PDS.

Your exit is replacing four MPF exit here.  Thanks again.

and here's an enhancement

many products / users issue messages using characters that are not alpha,
numeric or national ... therefore they cannot be member names ...

check the first 8 positions ... if not alpha, numeric or national ... use a
default membername of $$$$#### or whatever ... and allow the logic in the
commands member to be able to IF MSG = <CMBT004> ... type logic ....

not sure how much effort you care to put into this .... I may look at it if I
get time (maybe mid next month)

thanx Dean

Hi Glenn,

I have been trying your excellent MPF exit on some of my test systems. I
needed a mpf exit to submit SMF save jobs and so I installed your first
version.  I had this working fine for one of our systems but hit a snag on a
second.  On this system we use SMF file longer than the normal and instead
of IEE362A we get IEE391A. sample:-

IEE391A SMF ENTER DUMP FOR DATA SET ON VOLSER KSYQUE, 640
                DSN=SYS1.RESCUE.MAN1

This is a problem for us as it is a multi-line message and your exit only
handles the first line. The second line contains the DSN!
As an exercise I decided to try to update your code to handle a second line
and then hit a second snag. Your exit also does not allow for extra blanks
between words which appear at the start of the second line for IEE391A.
have spent a little time working on it and I have made the following
changes:-

1. Support for a second message line.
2. Multiple blanks allowed between words.
3. Word length increased to 64 chars.
4. Support for IF not word (coded as IF \WORD %%).
5. Abend command to abend exit for testing.

Do you want a copy of my version?  I have reworked my version on the one
dated "MPFXTALL 995  2005/07/15  2005/07/20 11:05:15"

Best regards

Hi Glenn,

I have attached my version of MPFXTALL.  The changed lines are identified
with **PJ#** comments.

Changes as follows:-

PJ1 Support second message line. CTXTTXPN is zero on initial entry but
is filled on the next entry if the second line is requested by setting
CTXTRPML in CTXTRFB1 and exiting from the module. I save the address of the
dynamic area in the exit work area pointed to by CTXTIWKP.  I also increased
the maximum message length as I was not sure about getting two long line
I have only tested this with message IEE391A.  I also changed the routines
using the message length and found I had to add 2 to the length to get the
TRT to work when the last field required was at the end of the message.

PJ2 Multiple blanks between message words.  The second line for the
IEE391A message has 16 blanks at the start and this is the main reason for
this change.

PJ3 Word length increased to 64 chars.  Again for the message IEE391A
the DSN= field was longer than your 12 characters. 64 was arbitrary choice.

PJ4 Support for IF not word (coded as IF \WORD %%).  Why did I think
this was useful?  I was receiving message IEE388I after IEE391A. Although I
had no need to process it, I used for testing and realised that this message
was not 2 lines but issued twice with different values.  Examples:-

IEE391A SMF ENTER DUMP FOR DATA SET ON VOLSER KSYQUE, 704
                DSN=SYS1.RESCUE.MAN2
IEE388I SMF NOW RECORDING ON VOLSER KSYQUE, DSN=SYS1.RESCUE.MAN1 TIME=
IEE388I         13:14:13

The time in the second line is not a keyword so I thought how could it be
processed? If the "IF WORD" supported a not option then I could test for
word 01 not "SMF".  I chose \WORD to reduce the extra coding needed.

Example of my test member for IEE388I:-
* IEE388I SMF NOW RECORDING ON VOLSER KSYQUE, DSN=SYS1.RESCUE.MAN1
* IEE388I         hh:mm:ss

IF WORD 01 SMF
GET WORD 01
WTO WORD 01 |%|
ENDGET
GET WORD 02
WTO WORD 02 |%|
ENDGET
ENDIF
IF \WORD 01 SMF
WTO -WORD 01
GET WORD 01
WTO WORD \01 |%|
ENDGET
ENDIF

PJ5 Abend command to abend exit for testing.  I used this to debug what
I added and to examine some of the exit fields.

You can use my name in the readme file.  I now plan to use your exit to
replace the version I was using from file 597 as appropriate.  I have
updated the latest version from the CBTTAPE.

Thanks for your example code regarding the name/token processing, I intend
to try to use this in a RACF exit to pass back an error message.

Please keep me informed regarding any ongoing changes or new facilities.

Best Regards
Peter

Keep up the good work, Glenn.

I've modified MPFLOAD, which I'm attaching (in XMI format).

The couple of changes were made to get the MPF table loaded as quickly as
possible during IPL.  The changes are detailed in the comment block I've
added to your program.  If you like the idea, by all means, go ahead and
incorporate it in your future versions.

If you have any questions on it, feel free to email me.

Appreciate your comments.
