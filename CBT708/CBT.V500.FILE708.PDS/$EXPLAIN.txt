 MPFLOAD:
  Program logic overview:
  - Get dataset name from the PARM.
  - Dynamic allocation of the commands datasets directory.
  - Retrieve and save the member names and a count of the members from
     the directory.
  - Obtain a block of storage from ECSA subpool 241 key 0.  Size of
     the getmain is equal to 8192 times the member count.
  - Dynamic allocation of the commands dataset(member).
  - Read the content of member and load it into the obtained storage.
     Loop till member count is equal to 0.
  - Check to see if Name/Token exists if so delete Name/Token and free
      the storage.
  - Create Name/Token and place the address and length of the storage
      into the Token field.  Display status and end.

 Table format:
  Each record in storage is 8192 bytes.  The first 8 is the member name,
   the next 80 times 102 are the commands from that member.  One record
   from the member is equal to one of the 102, 80 byte fields in the
   table.

 Limitations:
  Max of 1000 members, I think that's plenty.
  Max of 102 commands per message/member, see above.
  Max of 53 characters per WTO and WTOH, you can use multiple lines if
   needed.
  Max of 40 characters for the GET and REPLACE

 Calculated getmain:
  Number of members times 8192 bytes, so for 100 messages/members that
   would be a puny 824K of ECSA, less then one meg of ECSA.

 MPFLOAD Bugs:
  I don't know of any so far.

 MPFXTALL:
  Program logic overview:
  - Obtain a block of storage below the line.
  - Prime part of the work area with predefined data.
  - Check for WTOR, if so adjust the end of the MSGID.
  - Get Name/Token if the Name/Token exists find message ID.
  - Read commands.
  - Determine the type of command, reply, iflogic, highlight, WTO/H, switch,
    or get.
  - Either reply, enter command, highlight, WTO/H, get or switch.
  - Loop read and process till end of commands.

 MPFLOAD Bugs:
  I don't know of any so far.
