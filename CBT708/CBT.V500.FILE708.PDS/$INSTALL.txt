 1. Copy member PROC into SYS1.PROCLIB(MPFLOAD) or any PROCLIB.

 2. Authorize MPFLOAD to access the commands dataset RACF facility class
     started, the user and group fields need to be changed for your
     site.  Below are the RACF commands that need to be entered:
        RDEFINE STARTED MPFLOAD.* STDATA(USER(stcusr) GROUP(sys1))
        SETROPTS RACLIST(STARTED) REFRESH

 3. Place the follow into COMMNDxx in PARMLIB:
        COM='SET MPF=00'
     Or place the following into the INIT section of CONSOLxx in PARMLIB
        MPF(00)

 4. Place the following into IEFSSNxx in PARMLIB:
        SUBSYS SUBNAME(MPFX) /* DEFINE DUMMY S/S FOR MPFLOAD */
          INITRTN(MPFLOAD) INITPARM('SYS1.MPF.COMMANDS')

 5. Create a PDS SYS1.MPF.COMMANDS FB 80.  Copy or create the members
     for the messages you want to manage.  This dataset must reside in
     the master catalog.  The member names MUST match the message ID's
     you plan on managing with MPFLSTxx, unless your using the AUTO/TOKEN
     feature.  If you change the dataset name (NOT RECOMMENDED) you  will
     have to make the following modifications; dataset name in the following
     locations proc MPFLOAD, program MPFLOAD, IEFSSNxx, it still must
     reside in the master catalog.

 6. Extract the MACRO dataset by entering:
        TSO RECEIVE INDA('this.dataset.name(MACROS)')

 7. Run member ASMACL.  Change the dataset names referenced by
     <=== CHANGE.  The load modules (SYSLMOD) must be in your LINKLST
     and an APF authorized dataset.

 8. Issue command F LLA,REFRESH

 9. Issue command S MPFLOAD

10. Modify your MPFLSTxx to include messages you wish to manage.
     Then issue command SET MPF=00 .  Make sure any entries in
     MPFLST00 that are to be managed by MPFXTALL have a corresponding
     member in the SYS1.MPF.COMMANDS dataset and MPFLOAD has been run.
