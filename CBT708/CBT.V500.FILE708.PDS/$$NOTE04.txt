Subject: MPFXDSPL new program in the MPF series

Dear Glenn,

I love your MPFEXIT programs.  As a result of them we are able to
drop NetView saving us a good bit of money that we can use to
invest on other software.  At IPL time it takes the operator's
errors out of the Shutdown procedure.  I have mashed together
MPFLOAD and MPFXTALL plus source code for a date routine to
create a display of the MPF in core table.  We use MPFXDSPL to
document the MPF table.  This guarantees in black and white, that
there is no question if a change was made and what the change is.
I hope that you can use it.
