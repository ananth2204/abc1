//*     This isn't your mother's MPF exit!  It's the do all MPF     *   FILE 708
//*       exit.  It should replace most, if not all of your         *   FILE 708
//*       existing MPF exits.  If you are not using any MPF         *   FILE 708
//*       exits, you should check this one out.  Version 5.9.       *   FILE 708
//*                                                                 *   FILE 708
//*     The purpose of this product is to assist in automation      *   FILE 708
//*       of your MVS operating system.  This product will work     *   FILE 708
//*       on all system levels of ESA, OS/390 and z/OS.             *   FILE 708

//*     The use of MPF has now become very easy.  No more recoding  *   FILE 708
//*       or writing a new MPF exits every time you need to issue a *   FILE 708
//*       reply or command.  No more maintaining multiple MPF exits *   FILE 708
//*       for seperate events.                                      *   FILE 708

//*     Ease of use, once installed all that needs to be done to    *   FILE 708

//*             1. Create a new member in the commands dataset.     *   FILE 708
//*             2. Make an entry into MPFLSTxx.                     *   FILE 708
//*             3. Start MPFLOAD                                    *   FILE 708
//*             4. SET MPF=xx                                       *   FILE 708

//*     And now for the creme de la creme.  I now present the       *   FILE 708

//*       set switch, delete switch, alter switch, if switch on,    *   FILE 708
//*       if switch off, if switch equal and if switch not equal.   *   FILE 708
//*       This is my way of thanking Don, Todd and Emma for         *   FILE 708
//*       intrusting me with their OS upgrade project after only a  *   FILE 708
//*       few conference calls.  I believe this should complete     *   FILE 708
//*       your free automation solution.  I also believe everybody  *   FILE 708
//*       else should thank them for inspiring me to write this     *   FILE 708
//*       code.  With this addition to my product all of you should *   FILE 708
//*       be armed sufficiently to totally eliminate any other      *   FILE 708
//*       automation products at your shop.                         *   FILE 708
//*      Now for the meat and taters:                               *   FILE 708
//*      The SETSWITCH command will set a persistent switch with    *   FILE 708
//*       a user defined name field up to 8 characters and a user   *   FILE 708
//*       defined status/information field up to 16 characters.     *   FILE 708
//*       Both fields have no other limitations; you can use any    *   FILE 708
//*       characters, spaces, special characters and numbers.       *   FILE 708
//*      The DELSWITCH command that's what it does, it deletes      *   FILE 708
//*       the switch.                                               *   FILE 708
//*      The ALTSWITCH is used to alter the status/information      *   FILE 708
//*       part of the switch from anything to anything.             *   FILE 708
//*      The PUTSWITCH places whatever is stored in the             *   FILE 708
//*       status/information part of the switch to the console.     *   FILE 708
//*      The IF SWITCH logic has four separate checks.              *   FILE 708
//*      The IF SWITCH ON checks only to see if the switch is       *   FILE 708
//*       on/exists, it doesn't check the status/information        *   FILE 708
//*       section.                                                  *   FILE 708
//*      The IF SWITCH OFF checks only to see if the switch is      *   FILE 708
//*       off/doesn't exists.                                       *   FILE 708
//*      The IF SWITCH EQ checks the named switch                   *   FILE 708
//*       status/information field is equal to that of the if       *   FILE 708
