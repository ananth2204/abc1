  The use of MPF has now become very easy.  No more recoding or
   rewriting your MPF exits, every time you need to add a new reply or
   issue a new command.  No more maintaining 10, 12 or even 20 separate
   MPF exits to manage a dozen or so separate events.

  Once installed, all you need to do to manage a new message is to:
    1. Add a new member to SYS1.MPF.COMMANDS using the name of the
       message ID you want to manage.  In that member would be the
       replies/commands you want performed for said message.

    2. Modify MPFLSTxx to add the message ID you want managed.
       messageid,SUP(NO),RETAIN(NO),USEREXIT(MPFXTALL)

    3. Issue a S MPFLOAD command to reload the commands dataset to the
       Name/Token.

    4. Issue a SET MPF=xx command to set MPF to start managing messages.

  Commands/Reply:
    REPLY NN,xx
    REPLY NN,xxxx
    WTO Anything you want to say
    WTOH Anything you want to say highlighted
    HIGHLIGHT thats what does it highlights a message
    SUPPRESS thats what does it suppresses a message from the SYSLOG and joblog
    NOJOBLOG suppresses a message from the joblog only still on syslog
    NOSYSLOG suppresses a message from the syslog only still on joblog
    SETSWITCH sets a switch for furture checking
    DELSWITCH deletes switch
    ALTSWITCH alters switch
    PUTSWITCH puts status/information to the console
    Any commands you want up to a total of 102 lines per member

  Logic Commands:
    IF SYSID EQ sysid
    IF ALL EQ word1 word2 word3 word4
    IF WORD ## word
    IF MSGID EQ messageid
    IF MSGID+xx FOR xx xxx
    IF SWITCH ON xxxxxxxx
    IF SWITCH OFF xxxxxxxx
    IF SWITCH EQ xxxxxxxx xxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx
    IF SWITCH NQ xxxxxxxx xxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx
    GET WORD ##
    GET REPLYID

  Usage:
  - Format for SYS1.PARMLIB(MPFLST00) is as follows starting in column 1
     messageid,SUP(NO),RETAIN(NO),USEREXIT(MPFXTALL)
  - All message id's specified in MPFLSTxx that are to be managed by
     MPFXTALL must have an exact matching member name in SYS1.MPF.COMMANDS
     or the first 8 characters of the messageid or whatever the AUTO/TOKEN
     AUTO(xxxxx) states, the MPFLSTxx member in parmlib must be the
     full messageid.
  - All commands in the commands datset must start in column 1
  - A * or space in column 1 is treated as a comment
  - All IF statements must have a matching ENDIF.
  - All IF SWITCH statements must have a matching ENDIF SWITCH ON/OFF/EQ/NE
  - All GET's must have a matching ENDGET.
  - The GET can be used as an inner GET with all outer IF's.
  - If you need to shutdown this exit issue SET MPF=NO


  Have Fun, I did writing it!
