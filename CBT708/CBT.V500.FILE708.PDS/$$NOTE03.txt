Hi Glenn,
I'm starting to implement your MPFXTALL to take care of
some automation at IPL.  I had the following RACF error
on my test LPAR the first time I tried to start TCPIP
after "OMVS INITIALIZATION COMPLETE" message was generated.
This is the only use of MPFXTALL that has required any
RACF (except for the MPFLOAD proc) so far.  It hasn't
caused any problem & may not even be worth mentioning,
but I thought I would drop you a note & let you know about it.

PS -- Great software & easy to use!!

I don't mind coming to work, it's the eight hour wait to go home
