Update/change to the GET REPLYID.

It seems I used an @ for the reply id replacement character and
Dean happens to use an @ in his SMF dataset name causing him a
problem, sorry Dean.  So I have changed the @ to a & which can't
be used in a dataset name.  Jim from Alaska please make sure you
modify your replyid to use the new character;

SETSWITCH IDMSV8   &,/CHE DUMPQ

Since I just created this feature for Jim I figure no one else is
using it yet, but if you are please take note when installing the
new release.

And while I was in there I added a couple a more goodies for
Dean, the IF MSGID NE and IF MSGNE+ xx FOR xx.

Feed back from more of you would be nice.
