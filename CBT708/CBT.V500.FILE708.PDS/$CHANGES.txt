Changes to MPFXTALL for Version 5.0

1.Removal of dynamic allocation from program MPFXTALL.  Reasons:
IBM does not recommend the use of dynamic allocation in an mpf
exit and its no longer necessary as a result of Garrys Sub
System addition.

2.Additions to suppression are suppressing from joblog only and
suppressing from syslog only, by Dean.

3.Change to the display /* Issued by MPFXTALL for messageID */
this is now done via wto, idea from Willy.

4.Error handling for non-numeric conditions; this eliminates a
problem when user codes numeric incorrectly.

5.Increased total number of commands/logic from 51 to 102.

6.AUTO/TOKEN feature see below

7. Special character handling for message id's is now available
with the use of the AUTO/TOKEN feature.  For a message that start
with a special character like a dash

The MPFLSTxx member would contain the following:
  -SSCCORP01E,SUP(NO),USEREXIT(MPFXTALL),AUTO(SSCCORP1)
  And the commands member SSCCORP1 would contain whatever.

8.The IF MSGID+xx FOR xx this can be used when you have dozens of
similar messages like CSQ1234I, CSQ1234E, CSQ1235I, CSQ1235E etc
and you only want to suppress only the I level messages.  The
MPFLSTxx member would contain:

CSQ*,USEREXIT(MPFXTALL),AUTO(CSQMSGS)

And the commands member would look like this

IF MSGID+07 FOR 01 I
SUPPRESS
ENDIF

9.And now for the crme de la crme.  I now present the
switch/variable section of my product, consisting of the set
switch, delete switch, alter switch, if switch on, if switch off,
if switch equal and if switch not equal.  This is my way of
thanking Don, Todd and Emma for intrusting me with their OS
upgrade project after only a few conference calls.   I believe
this should complete your free automation solution.  I also
believe everybody else should thank them for inspiring me to
write this code.  With this addition to my product all of you
should be armed sufficiently to totally eliminate any other
automation products at your shop.  Now for the meat and taters:

The SETSWITCH command will set a persistent switch with a user
defined name field up to 8 characters and a user defined
status/information field up to 16 characters.  Both fields have
no other limitations; you can use any characters, spaces, special
characters and numbers.  The DELSWITCH command thats what it
does, it deletes the switch.  The ALTSWITCH is used to alter the
status/information part of the switch from anything to anything.
The IF SWITCH logic has four separate checks.  The IF SWITCH ON
checks only to see if the switch is on/exists, it doesnt check
the status/information section.  The IF SWITCH OFF checks only to
see if the switch is off/doesnt exists.

The IF SWITCH EQ checks the named switch status/information field
is equal to that of the if statement.  The IF SWITCH NE checks
the named switch status/information field to not be equal to the
if statement.  Heres all the different the syntax:

SETSWITCH xxxxxxxx xxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx
DELSWITCH xxxxxxxx
ALTSWITCH xxxxxxxx xxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx
IF SWITCH EQ xxxxxxxx xxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx
ENDIF SWITCH EQ
IF SWITCH NE xxxxxxxx xxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx
ENDIF SWITCH NE
IF SWITCH ON xxxxxxxx
ENDIF SWITCH ON
IF SWITCH OFF xxxxxxxx
ENDIF SWITCH OFF
*
Heres a sample of usage for messages:
DCOMMMP1:246:0:DB00308I - LOG AREA IS  50% FULL,   44963 BLOCKS
DCOMMMP1:246:0:DB00308I - LOG AREA IS  70% FULL,   44963 BLOCKS
MPFLSTxx entry would look like this:
DCOMMMP1:246:0:DB00308I,USEREXIT(MPFXTALL)
Member DCOMMMP1 would look like this:
IF SWITCH DCOMMMP1 OFF
SETSWITCH DCOMMMP1 SUBMIT DCOMSPLP
S DCOMSPLP
WTO MPFXTALL submitted offload DCOMSPLP for DCOMMMP1
ENDIF SWITCH OFF
*
IF SWITCH DCOMMMP1 ON
WTO DCOMSPLP active for DCOMMMP1 no offload submitted
ENDIF SWITCH ON
*
Member $HASP395 would look like this:
IF WORD 01 DCOMMMP1
DELSWITCH DCOMMMP1
WTO DCOMSPLP has ended DCOMMMP1 switch has been reset
ENDIF

The AUTO/TOKEN feature allows you to SUPPRESS, NOJOBLOG,
  NOSYSLOG and HIGHLITE multiple messages with one entry.
  No commands member is necessary for these.
    BA*,USEREXIT(MPFXTALL),AUTO(SUPPRESS)
           *
Also, the AUTO/TOKEN feature has member selection, this
  allows you to select a different commands member then
  the messageID states.  This allows multiple messages to
  point to one commands member.
    ABC1001E,USEREXIT(MPFXTALL),AUTO(ABCMSGS)
    ABC1002E,USEREXIT(MPFXTALL),AUTO(ABCMSGS)
      or
    ABC*,USEREXIT(MPFXTALL),AUTO(ABCMSGS)
