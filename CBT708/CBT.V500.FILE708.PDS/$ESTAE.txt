MPF allows specifying the same MPF Exit routine for more than one
message id.  If an MPF exit routine such as MPFXTALL abends, it is
disabled for ALL the message id's that it is associated with.
This can have several undesirable side effects:
1) Perhaps the exit is abending due to a bug triggered by only one
 message id that rarely occurs
2) Until the disablement is noticed, many automation events can be lost

GG59 adds ESTAEX protection around the entire MPFXTALL code; in the event
that there is an abend in MPFXTALL, a WTO MPF038E MPFXTALL ABENDED; ABEND
WAS SUPPRESSED message will be issued, no further processing will occur
for the message that caused the abend, but since the abend was suppressed,
MPFXTALL remains active.

The MPF038E message is an indication that a serious failure has occurred
in MPFXTALL that must be addressed, however in the mean time, MPFXTALL
continues to remain active.  As stated earlier, the failure could have
been triggered by a obscure bug caused by a very rarely occuring WTO.
It is probably better to allow MPFXTALL to continue to remain active
processing the bulk of (non-problematic) messages.
