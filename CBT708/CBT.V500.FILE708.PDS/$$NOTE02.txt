//*     You want colors I'll give you colors, this ones for Jason.  *
//*       Change the color make it blink, underline and/or reverse  *
//*       video.  The options for the DISPLAY command are BLUE,     *
//*       PINK, RED, GREEN, TURQUOISE, YELLOW, WHITE, BLINK,        *
//*       REVERSE and UNDERLINE.                                    *
//*       The commands member to make it blink red would be:        *
//*                 DISPLAY RED                                     *
//*                 DISPLAY BLINK                                   *
//*                                                                 *
//*     A few very slick additions from Garry Green.  First is the  *
//*       ASTYPE this allows you too check if the task is a TSO,    *
//*       Batch or STC, T for TSO, J for BATCH and S for STC.       *
//*        IF ASTYPE EQ T                                           *
//*        IF ASTYPE EQ J                                           *
//*        IF ASTYPE EQ S                                           *
//*       So if you needed to reply cancel to the following message *
//*       only for TSO Userid's                                     *
//*        *61 IEF238D GSI - REPLY DEVICE NAME OR 'CANCEL'.         *
//*       The Commands IEF238D member would look like this          *
//*        IF ASTYPE EQ T                                           *
//*        REPLY NN,CANCEL                                          *
//*        ENDIF ASTYPE                                             *
//*       *                                                         *
//*     Now for the TSOROUTE command this allows a TSO user to      *
//*       reply to there own outstanding requests WTOR's from there *
//*       own TSO userid for WTOR's issued for there TSO userid.    *
//*       So if you want all user's to be able to reply to message  *
//*       *61 IEF238D GSI - REPLY DEVICE NAME OR 'CANCEL'.          *
//*       The Commands IEF238D member would look like this          *
//*        IF ASTYPE EQ T                                           *
//*        TSOROUTE REPLY                                           *
//*        ENDIF ASTYPE                                             *
//*       This will allow only the TSO userid to reply to the       *
//*       outstanding reply, the TSO userid will receive the        *
//*       following message, there will be no outstanding request   *
//*       on the master console:                                    *
//*        MPF201I ONLY THIS TSO TERMINAL CAN REPLY TO FOLLOWING    *
//*         WTOR-CONSOLES CAN'T REPLY                               *
//*        IEF238D GGG - REPLY DEVICE NAME OR 'CANCEL'.             *
//*       *                                                         *
//*       The other options for TSOROUTE are TSOROUTE which only    *
//*       sends a message to to the TSO userid as follows:          *
//*        MPF203I FOLLOWING WTOR FOR DISPLAY ONLY - REPLY MUST BE  *
//*         ENTERED FROM CONSOLE                                    *
//*        IEF238D GSI - REPLY DEVICE NAME OR 'CANCEL'.             *
//*       *                                                         *
//*       And the TSOROUTE SUPPRESS this will suppress the reply    *
//*       to the outstanding request, good for password replies.    *
//*       The message sent to the TSO userid is as follows:         *
//*        MPF201I ONLY THIS TSO TERMINAL CAN REPLY TO FOLLOWING    *
//*         WTOR-CONSOLES CAN'T REPLY                               *
//*        MPF202I REPLY VALUE YOU ENTER WILL BE SUPPRESSED FROM    *
//*         CONSOLE, JOBLOG & SYSLOG                                *
//*        IEF238D GSI - REPLY DEVICE NAME OR 'CANCEL'.             *
//*                                                                 *
//*     ESTAE recovery routine added by Garry GREAT addition        *
//*       now no matter what happens MPFTXALL will stay alive.      *
//*       If an MPF exit routine such as MPFXTALL abends, it is     *
//*       disabled for ALL the message id's that it is associated   *
//*       This can have several undesirable side effects:           *
//*       1) Perhaps the exit is abending due to a bug triggered by *
//*          only one message id that rarely occurs.                *
//*       2) Until the disablement is noticed, many automation      *
//*          events can be lost.                                    *
//*       ESTAEX protection around the entire MPFXTALL code;        *
//*       in the event that there is an abend in MPFXTALL, a WTO    *
//*       MPF038E MPFXTALL ABENDED; ABEND WAS SUPPRESSED message    *
//*       will be issued, no further processing will occur for the  *
//*       message that caused the abend, but since the abend was    *
//*       suppressed, MPFXTALL remains active.                      *
//*                                                                 *
