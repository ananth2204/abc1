NOTE: If you are modifying the code, you should be aware of some Rexx
      tricks I use.  See the TRICKS section of this member for more
      details.

Implementation details:
The archive application consists of 2 ISPF configuration options and a
PDS of rexx execs and ISPF panels.
The ISPF configuration options are:
MEMBER_LIST_LINE_COMMAND_COMMAND_EXIT       = A#CMDCK
SITE_WIDE_INITIAL_MACRO                     = A#INIT
These options are in source PDS member #CONFIG.

The a#CmdCk, a#Init and a#Open rexx programs MUST exist in a PDS that
is in every TSO user's SYSPROC or SYSEXEC concatenation.  The other
archive application rexx execs and ISPF panels can either be in the same
PDS or in another PDS that will be dynamically allocated during edit
sessions.
If the a#CmdCk exec cannot be found, you will not be able to use ISPF
single character line commands on any member lists.  Archiving will
still be in effect for edit sessions.
If the a#Init edit macro cannot be found, you will get an error every
time you enter ISPF edit or view and archiving will not be in effect.
a#Open is used by both a#CmdCk and a#Init and will cause problems with
archives if it cannot be found.

These are the rexx execs that currently make up the archive
application:
a#Can   - Terminate ISPF Edit sessions - undo a#Init.
          CANCEL is aliased to this macro.
a#CmdCk - Validate ISPF member list single character built-in commands.
          Alter rename and delete requests to maintain archive integrity.
          Allow O (Options) and H (History) from member lists.
a#Cmp   - Allow COMPARE against previous versions of the data.
          COMPARE is aliased to this macro.
a#cpArc - Copy members from a Source to a Target archive in batch.
          Use the #CPARC job to execute this.
a#End   - Call a#Save if required and terminate ISPF Edit sessions like
          CANCEL.  Undoes a#Init just like a#Can.
          END is aliased to this macro.
a#Info  - Get archive information for execs which are not run as edit
          macros.  May open an ARCnn table, which the caller needs to
          close.
a#Init  - Initialize ISPF Edit sessions:
          Allocate rexx and panel libraries, if necessary.
          Define SAVE, END and CANCEL, COMPARE and VIEW as macros (not
          built-in).
          Define macro aliases HIST/HISTORY and OPTS/OPTIONS.
          Create or open and initialize tables used in the application.
          These tables are closed by a#End and a#Can.
a#Make  - Used internally to create a 'temporary' dataset with a
          previous version of the data.
a#Open  - Used internally to resolve and open the archive control
          dataset for a member.
a#Opt   - Set the options for a dataset or member.
          OPTS and OPTIONS are aliased to this macro.
          a#CmdCk calls this for member list command O.
a#Opts  - Used internally to parse options strings.
a#Rest  - Restore a previous version (an alias of Restore is provided by
          a#Init).
          RESTORE is aliased to this macro.
a#Save  - Save the currently edited data, maintaining archived versions.
          SAVE is aliased to this macro.
a#Touch - Exec to be used in foreground or batch to set the date and
          time that a member was last known to be working correctly.
a#VHist - Display version history.
          Allow a user to view a previous version of the edited data.
          HIST and HISTORY are aliased to this macro.
          a#CmdCk calls this for member list command H.
a#View  - View a previous version of the edited data.
          VIEW is aliased to this macro.

These are the ISPF panels that are part of the archive application:
a#DescP - Data entry panel to create or modify the dataset (member)
          description.
a#DHistP- Display panel to show a specific version's history (change)
          information.
a#HistP - Data entry panel to create or modify a version's history
          (change description).
a#OptDP - Data entry panel to modify the dataset options.
a#OptMP - Data entry panel to modify the member options.
a#VersP - Table display panel to show or select dataset (member)
          versions.

In addition,
#cpArc    is JCL that can be used to run a#cpArc in batch.
#TouchJb  is JCL that can be used to run a#Touch in batch.

TRICKS:
   Initializing variables
      To set multiple variables in one statement, I use
      parse VALUE a b c... WITH Var1 Var2 Var3 ...
      If I am setting all the variables to '', I use
      parse VALUE WITH VarX,VarY,VarZ ...
      If I want to set SOME variables to values, and others to '', I use
      parse VALUE expression WITH VarA VarB,EmptyA,EmptyB
      I might also use parse VAR a VarA VarB,Empty1,Empty2...
      Anything after the 1st comma gets a null ('') value.
      NOTE that this is NOT the case for parse ARG.
      I might occasionally parse the output of a function
      parse VALUE FuncA(parm1,parm2) WITH RC Var1...
   Formatting
      To format an expression, I use
      new = Translate(OutputFormat,old,InputFormat)
      like this: nDate = Translate('1234/56/78',Date('S'),'12345678')
      which would set nDate to '2005/09/15'
      if Date('S') returns '20050915'.
      The characters in the InputFormat MUST be unique.
      Read the TSO-E Rexx Reference manual Built-in Functions/Translate
      description for more information.
   ISPF and ISPF edit
      I use both the ISPF &variable notation and the ISPF Edit
      (variable) notation to reference the value of a variable.
      So  "LMClose DataID(&DataID)" is the same as
          "LMClose DataID("DataID")"
      and "LINE_AFTER" i-1 "= (Cur)" is like
          "LINE_AFTER" i-1 "= '"Cur"'"
      In the LINE_AFTER case, (Cur) will work properly even
      if Cur contains the character '.
   Value()
      The statement
      call Value oType,Value(oType) v||'('Val')'
      is equivalent to
      interpret oType '=' oType "v||'('Val')'"
      Thus, if oType is 'MEMBER', v is 'Hist' and Val is 'no', then
      the expression evaluates to:
      MEMBER = MEMBER 'Hist'||'(no)'
