Archive dataset format:

Key:
Keywords are not case sensitive.
Variable data is retained as entered.
Data enclosed in Ý¨ is optional, and the Ý¨ characters are not part of
the format.
Archive members are broken into sections similar to ISPF panels.
Each section begins with a ')' character in column 1, followed by the
section type.
A section may contain header and data lines.
If it has header or data lines, it will describe the number of header
and data lines in the section line.
For instance,
)Section Header(5) Data(7) Property(variable data)
would describe a section of type Section containing 5 header and 7 data
lines.
The entire section would then be 13 lines - the )Section line, 5 header
lines and 7 data lines.
The next section (if any) would immediately follow.
All header lines begin with a '-' in column 1.
Data lines may or may not begin with a '-' depending on the type of
data.
Section and Header lines are limited to 80 characters maximum.
Data lines may be as long as the data being archived.

In section and header description lines, all variable data is enclosed
in parentheses, which are required.

The format of the parenthesized data is:
#      decimal number, may be preceded by the number of digits expected,
       otherwise free form
name   a name following standard conventions
text   free form text, may be preceded by a maximum number of characters
bool   boolean (yes or no) data.  omitting the data in parentheses is
       the same as YES.
       omitting the keyword completely is the same as NO.
       0 = YES, 1 = NO.
other  any characters not described above are as written

In a PDS archive:
Member names containing or ending with a '{' character are reserved for
archive use.
Even if the archive is a separate PDS, data members must not contain or
end with '{'.

Z{PARMS{ member - describes archive.
There are no header or data lines in the Z{PARMS{ member.
Any number of lines, format follows:
)Opts Hist(#|bool) NoArc(bool) NoSync(bool) Desc(bool) Quiet(bool) Limit(#)
)Resolve ID(4#)

The )Opts line declares archive-wide options.  You may have as many as
      required.
      Hist is how many versions of history to display on open.
      NoArc displays a warning if no archive data is present for source
      data.
      NoSync displays a warning if edited data is out-of-sync with
      archive control data.
      Desc displays the data description on open.
      Limit is a limit on the number of versions to keep (not yet
      implemented).
      All options are optional.
      Quiet or Quiet(yes) is the same as
       Hist(0) NoArc(no) NoSync(no) Desc(no).
      Hist or Hist(yes) is the same as Hist(1),
      Hist(no) is the same as Hist(0).
The )Resolve line defines the highest used 4 digit contention ID,
      described below.
      There can only be 1 )Resolve line.  ID is required.

If the member name is less than 7 characters, the archive member is the
member name followed by a '{' character.
For example, if the data member is 'BACKUP', the archive member is
'BACKUP{'.
If the data member name is 8 characters, the last character is replaced
by '{'.
Thus, the archive member for data member 'PSSU$MAP' would be 'PSSU$MA{'.
This has the potential for name contention, however, since the archive
member for 'PSSU$MAT' is also 'PSSU$MA{'.  In fact, the archive member
for 'PSSU$MA' is ALSO 'PSSU$MA{'.
In cases like this, the "natural" archive member (e.g. 'PSSU$MA{') is
used as a "contention" member.
The contention member contains one line:
)Resolve ID(4#)

The actual archive member name is then formed from the contention ID,
like 'Z{'+ID+x+'{', where ID is the 4 digit contention ID and x is the
8th character of the member name.
For example, if the contention ID for 'PSSU$MAx' is 1032, the archive
member for 'PSSU$MAP' would be 'Z{1032P{', and the archive member for
'PSSU$MA' would be 'Z{1032{'.

In a sequential archive, the member naming issues described above are
not relevant.

In all archives the archive dataset or member MUST begin with a
)Current section.
The )Current section description line's format is:
)Current ÝHeader(#)¨ ÝData(#)¨ ÝMember(name)¨

The Header property is a number indicating how many header lines
immediately follow.  All header lines are optional.
The possible header lines are:
-Stats ÝVersion(2#.2#)¨ ÝUser(name)¨ ÝModified(4#/2#/2# 2#:2#:2#)¨
-Opts Hist(#|bool) NoArc(bool) NoSync(bool) Desc(bool) Quiet(bool) Limit(#)
-Desc (60text)
-Hist (60text)

The -Stats line will almost always exist, and describes the statistics
of the current state of the member or dataset.
It will not exist if the member previously existed without stats, is
newly archived, and has not been updated after archiving.
The -Opts line is identical to the )Opts section of the Z{PARMS{ member.
There may be as many as 6 -Desc lines.  This is a description of this
archived dataset or member.
The -Hist line will only exist for a deleted member.  It describes the
deletion.

The Data property is a number indicating how many data lines follow the
header lines.  It is used for sequential archives and archives of
deleted members in a PDS.  The data lines are the most current contents
of the data member or dataset.

The Member property is the name of the member being archived.  It is
used during member name contention resolution.  It is required for PDS
archives and not used for sequential archives.

Following the )Current section there may be any number (perhaps limited
by the Limit option) of )Archive sections.
The )Archive section description line's format is:
)Archive ÝHeader(#)¨ ÝData(#)¨

The Header property is a number indicating how many header lines
immediately follow.  All header lines are optional.
The possible header lines are:
-Stats ÝVersion(2#.2#)¨ ÝUser(name)¨ ÝModified(4#/2#/2# 2#:2#:2#)¨
-Hist (60text)

The -Stats line will almost always exist, and describes the statistics
for this version of the member or dataset.
It will not exist if the member previously existed without stats and has
been updated with history after archiving.
There may be as many as 6 -Hist lines.  This is a description of the
changes made to this version of the archived dataset or member.

The Data property is a number indicating how many data lines follow the
header lines.
The data lines describe how to regress the member from the version
described immediately before it to the version being described.  For
instance, in the archive fragment below,
)Current Header(2) Member(BIRTHS)
-Stats Version(07.05) User(NOAH) Modified(2075/12/31 23:59:59)
-Desc (Keep track of birth dates)
)Archive Header(2) Data(...)
-Stats Version(01.12) User(DUMMY) Modified(1963/08/24 11:32:51)
-Hist (Bob was born)
...
)Archive Header(2) Data(...)
-Stats Version(01.11) User(OLDDUMMY) Modified(1927/10/30 11:32:51)
-Hist (Ted was born)
...

the data lines described in the 2nd )Archive section describe how to
regress the member BIRTHS from version 01.12 back to 01.11.

The data lines consist of -Del lines and -Ins lines (with the data to be
inserted).
The format of a -Del line is:
-Del Count(#) Start(#)

where the Count property is how many lines to delete and the Start
property is the 1st line to delete.  Line numbers are ISPF edit
relative line numbers - that is, they start at 1 and are numbered
sequentially to the end of the data set or member.

The format of a -Ins line group is:
-Ins Lines(#) Start(#)
Lines lines of data

where the Lines property is how many lines of data to insert (these
lines immediately follow the -Ins line) and the Start property is the
line number the 1st inserted data line will have after insertion.  Line
numbers are ISPF edit relative line numbers.
