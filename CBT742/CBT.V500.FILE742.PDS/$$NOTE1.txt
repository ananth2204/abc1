Hi.  'Archive' is a source versioning system for ISPF Edit/View.

It is in the early stages of development (it works, but...  :)
The documentation members all begin with #.
Everything else begins with A#.

We do use this for SYS1.PARMLIB, SYS1.TCPPARMS and other
datasets, but there are only 4 z/OS system programmers in my
shop.

We do not use this for application source code, yet.  It needs
some more work (and management acceptance) first.

The only warning I would like to give those to whom this is
distributed follows:

NOTE: all these rexx execs, etc. are SAMPLES ONLY.  Any
experimentation with them is at your own risk.  Do not trust your
data/processes to them without personally verifying all logic and
operation.  All supplied execs are works in progress and DO
contain bugs and significant undocumented limitations.

I hope you enjoy this.
