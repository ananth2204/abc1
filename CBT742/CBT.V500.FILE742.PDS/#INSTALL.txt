In the install PDS:
The member #CONFIG contains definitions needed for ISPF customization.
Copy this member into your site ISPF customization PDS member (for us,
this is 'OS390.MAINT.CONFIG.Z110(ISPFCFG)'.  You will use this to build
an ISPF configuration module.

From an ISPF command line, type 'TSO ISPCCONF'.
   This will bring up the ISPF Configuration Utility.
Put your configuration dataset and member in the Keyword File Data Set
section.
Select option 3, Verify Keyword Table Contents.
   You should get the message 'Keyword file verified' in the upper right.
Select option 4, Build Configuration Table Load Module.
   Verify that the 'Input Keyword File Data set' is the same as used
   above, and select an Output Configuration Table Load Module Data Set.
   I would suggest putting this in a dataset that is NOT in the
   LPA/Link/Joblib/Steplib/ISPLLib search sequence for now.
Press Enter to generate the load module.
   It will be named ISPCFIGU.

Alter your logon PROC/CList/Exec to allocate the install PDS to SYSEXEC
and ISPPLIB.
Now either alter the above to allocate your ISPF configuration module
dataset to ISPLLIB, or copy ISPCFIGU from your configuration module
dataset to a library in the search concatenation.
For example - to add this to MCIT's #SYSTSO5 proc, you would edit
SYS2.PROD.TSO5.ISRPRIM.Z110(ISPFTSO) to add PUBLIC.ARCHIVE.SOURCE to
SYSEXEC and ISPPLIB.  If you put the ISPCFIGU module into
PUBLIC.ARCHIVE.LOAD, you would add that to ISPLLIB in the same dataset.
If you added ISPCFIGU to the Link list, you will need to refresh it.

You should now be able to log on to your TSO proc, and use Archive.
I use an alias PUBLIC.ARCHIVE.SOURCE which points at the current
version, e.g. PUBLIC.ARCHIVE.V102.SOURCE to simplify upgrades.

NOTE:  Every TSO user that will get the ISPCFIGU module you created MUST
have the ARCHIVE.SOURCE PDS in their SYSEXEC and ISPPLIB concatenations.
Otherwise they will get failures using ISPF member list line commands
and ISPF edit/view.
