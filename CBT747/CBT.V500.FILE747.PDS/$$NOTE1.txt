Hi Sam,

I have updated my IODF script (for File 736) which I'll send to
you soon...well it was back in April but the project to upgrade
the processors and z/OS took a while.  I have also written a
program to access the OPERLOG data using multiblocks.  It has
several parameters including start/end date & time, extract
specified messages/system data/job, and to display it either as
SYSLOG or its own format.  It gives the advantage in that it will
not abend if there is a gap in the data which IEAMDBLG does
(during our z/Series upgrade, the ICFs were down due to the PORs
- hence gaps in the data).

If you would like me to send these through, just let me know.

Chat soon,
Mark.
