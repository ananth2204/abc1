Hi Sam,

I have built a new level of RECV390. I have corrected some typos
and restructured the documentation. I also found another bug in
RECV390 and fixed it. I named it " Bug Fix Zero-Bytes Trailer
Blocks IEBCOPY". The error was discovered when I tried to use
RECV390 module to expand CBT776.zip.  The Level of this pac is
now V1R1M6. Please process the new level into the CBT updates.

Thanks Edgar
