Hello Sam,

This is my modified version of RECV390 dated 2007-04-07. Changes
are documented below.  I've tried to comment all changes and
modifications in the source and also to preserve the structure of
the logic and code.  The intention of my changes was to get a
complete command line tool handling XMIT-files.  So the changes
are most driven from my point of view.  The source is compiled on
win32 with mingw.  I didn't test the changes on Linux until now,
but this should work too.  I named my modifications Version 1.1.5.
Next Version should be V2, when a major rewrite, addressing the
restructuration of the code towards a more c-like code is done.

Please feel free to distribute my changes.  I cover my changes
under the existing licence of RECV390.  The modifications
described therefore don't change the Licence of RECV390 in any
way.

ps.: Sorry for my English, but this is not my native tonque.
