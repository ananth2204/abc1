Note about EPUTL from Sam Golob:

EPUTL is a (re-entrant) program which is used in combination with
a macro called APUT, that allows you to easily convert a TSO command
using TPUT output (not trappable) to PUTLINE output (trappable).

There was a flaw in the EPUTL coding, where the GETMAIN did not
exactly match the FREEMAIN.  In the GETMAIN, we had to insert a
parameter of SP=0, to ensure that the FREEMAIN, which specified
SP=0, would not be a mismatch.  Most of the time, this is not a
problem, but we found a case where the calling program somehow
messed up the subpool number which the GETMAIN used.  This caused
a mismatch when FREEMAIN tried to free that storage and the result
as a S30A-14 abend.  We just fixed it by putting SP=0 into the
GETMAIN.  We have added EPUTL source here, and assembly JCL.
