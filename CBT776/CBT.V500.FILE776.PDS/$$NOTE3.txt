Hello Sam,

this is a complete rework of the RECV390 stuff, which I have
released in 2007. I have split the functionality of RECV390
into two modules named XMCLIST and XMCUTIL. XMCLIST deals with
the XMIT-format and IEBCOPY UNLOAD data. XMCUTIL provides some
conversion functions.

With XMCLIST and XMCUTIL, all RECV390 functions can be replaced.

- XMCLIST and XMCUTIL work as a TSO Command Processsor or as a x86 cmdline
          Program.  Ports working:  - MVS38, OS390, z/OS
                                    - Linux (x86,...)
                                    - WIN32/64 with MINGW

- XMCLIST handles PO and POE unloaded datasets
- XMCLIST handles all source devicetypes 3390, 3380, ...
- XMCLIST avoids Errors of RECV390, XMITMANAGER and others, dealing with short
          blocks: IEBCOPY UNLOAD of variable blocked shorter than Netdata
                  Block Length.

- XMCUTIL decodes Fixed and Variable Formats.

With kind regards

Edgar Hofmann
