       Installation Steps for the "SOFTCAPI" Facility

 1) Choose a Load Library to link the programs into.

 2) Edit member "ASSEM" (assembles/links programs).
    Make the tailoring changes (Change the Source location
    and the Load Library etc).

    Submit member "ASSEM" to assemble/link the programs
    into the Load Library chosen in step 1) above.

    Alternately, member "LINKEDIT" is included if you only
    want to run the LINKEDIT (BINDER) step.  You must
    tailor this member per the comments before submitting
    it.

 3) Allocate a message capture log dataset with DSORG=PS
    and Lrecl=150 (allocate enough space for 100 records).
    Apply security protection to this file.

 4) Define and secure-protect a gdg dataset for a daily
    backup of the message capture file chosen in step
    3) above.

 5) Tailor and place member 'STCJOB' into a system proc
    library or in the started jobs library 'SYS1.STCJOBS'.
    Substitute the dataset name chosen in step 3) above
    and the load library chosen in step 1) above.

 6) Place member "CPULOG" into some library which can be
    executed as a daily job. You will need to tailor this member
    for your installation.  It will input SAS member
    "CPUUTIL1".  Use the gdg dataset defined in step 4) above.
