 Re: New SoftCapping Assistance Facility - SOFTCAP - Filennn ...

 Sam,

 02/09/2010 - V01.01.01

   - New Facility for measuring cpu utilization and 4 hour rolling
     average inforatmion for assisting in setting a Softcap.

 This facility was written to assist in measuring Lpar cpu
 utilization against capacity for the purpose of Softcapping
 an Lpar or an Lpar group and using a 4 hour rolling average for
 IBM's subcapacity pricing metrics and reporting tool (SCRT).

 It can be used in conjuction with the SCPTOOL (SubCapacity
 Pricing Tool) that IBM provides.

 Program SOFTCAPI will capture cpu utilization and capacity
 information and issue two WTO messages to syslog and
 also write the two message to a log.

 SOFTCAPI WTO Messages:

 1) SOFTCAPI LPAR LPARX CURRENT ROLLING 4-HR AVG UTILIZATION IS 9 MSUS
 2) SOFTCAPI SY6 CAPACITY IS 27 MSUS, LPAR CAPACITY IS 15 MSUS

 The program can be issued by automation on a time interval
 to capture interval metrics to be graphed.

 The STCJOB (started job) member is used to execute the program
 and capture the data into a capture log.

 Member CPULOG captures the daily log and builds a daily gdg
 backup file before emptying the capture log for the next day.
 It also executes a SAS program to create a .csv file of the
 daily usage for graphing.

 See XMIT attachment for the new SOFTCAP assistant facility.

 For what it is worth ...

 Have a good week!
