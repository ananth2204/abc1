 MODIFICATION LEVEL: V01.01.01

 This facility was written to assist in measuring Lpar cpu
 utilization against capacity for the purpose of Softcapping
 an Lpar or an Lpar group and using a 4 hour rolling average for
 IBM's subcapacity pricing metrics and reporting tool (SCRT).

 It can be used in conjuction with the SCPTOOL (SubCapacity
 Pricing Tool) that IBM provides.
 (http://www-03.ibm.com/systems/z/resources/swprice/subcap/scpt/
 instruct.html)

 Program SOFTCAPI will capture cpu utilization and capacity
 information and issue two WTO messages to Syslog and
 also write the two message to a log file (OUTPUT file).

 SOFTCAPI WTO Messages:

 1) SOFTCAPI LPAR LPARX CURRENT ROLLING 4-HR AVG UTILIZATION IS 9 MSUS
 2) SOFTCAPI SY6 CAPACITY IS 27 MSUS, LPAR CAPACITY IS 15 MSUS

 The program can be invoked by automation on a time interval
 to capture interval metrics to be graphed.

 The STCJOB (started job) member is used to execute the program
 and capture the data into a capture log file.

 Member CPULOG captures the daily log and builds a daily gdg
 backup file before emptying the capture log for the next day.
 It also executes a SAS program to create a .csv file of the
 daily usage for graphing.

 Please report any bugs to Terry Miller at tkmille@ConocoPhillips.com

              interval reporting purposes.

 DISCLAIMER OF LIABILITY:
 ------------------------

                     DISCLAIMER

 Terry Miller and ConocoPhillips neither expresses nor implies
 any warranty as to the fitness of this SOFTCAPI facility.
 The use of this facility and the results therefrom is entirely
 at the risk of the user.  Consequently, the user may modify
 these programs in any way he/she thinks fit.

 All disclaimers that apply to CBT programs as described in
 the "Disclaimer Section" of File 001 of the CBT Tape Doc
 and on www.cbttape.org also apply to this package.

 INSTALLATION TAILORING/CUSTOMIZATION:
 -------------------------------------

 The Prefix to the Capture Log Message (File OUTPUT) uses a 3
 character sysid (system id) in program SOFTCAPI.  This is the
 CVTSNAME field.  If your system name is longer than 3
 characters in length, you will need to adjust the record.

 Note: the lpar name is also listed in the message elsewhere
 as an 8 character lpar name, so this may not be necessary
 to adjust.

 However, you should be aware of this as your sysname may be
 truncated in the prefix to the two WTO messages.

 If you do adjust the length of this field, you will also have
 to modify the SAS member "CPUUTIL1" as well.  It contains the
 record layout and format of the message capture file.

 The prefix to the SOFTCAPI messages is not shown above.
 The prefix to the SOFTCAPI messages is in format below.

 Date Time SYSID (22 Byte Prefix):

 Col 01-02: Month
 Col 03   : '/'
 Col 04-05: Day
 Col 06   : '/'
 Col 07-08: Year (2 digits)
 Col 09   : ' '
 Col 10-11: Time (Hours)
 Col 12   : ':'
 Col 13-14: Time (Minutes)
 Col 15   : ':'
 Col 16-17: Time (Seconds)
 Col 18   : ' '
 Col 19-21: Sysid (3 Characters) <= CVTSNAME
 Col 18   : ' '

 AUTHORIZATION:
 --------------

 No APF-Authorized libary is necessary for this facility.

 ASSUMPTIONS:
 ------------

 Member "CPULOG" assumes that you have some email facility to
 email a csv file such as Lionel's Dyck's XMITIP.  The XMITIP
 program is used in member "CPULOG" as it is delivered.  If
 you do not have XMITIP, you will need to substitute your own
 utilty for this purpose.

 You may obtain Lionel Dyck's XMITIP facility from the CBTTAPE
 File #314 or via Lionel's personal shareware web site
 http://www.lbdsoftware.com/tcpip.html.

 Member "CPULOG" also assumes that you have SAS installed at
 your installation.  If you do not have SAS installed, you will
 need to develop your own program for producing a .csv file
 for graphing (if you desire to graph the results).
 Note, only basic SAS is needed.  You do not have to have
 SAS GRAPHICS installed.  I use Microsoft excel for graphing.

 CERTIFICATION:
 --------------

 Program SOFTCAPI is certified for Z/oS 1.8 and higher.
 The softcapping information was made available in Z/oS 1.8
 at the Lpar Group Level.  You may be able to use this facility
 at a lower Z/oS Level, but it would not be certified at that
 lower Level.
