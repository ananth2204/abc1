//***FILE 978 is from Kenneth Tomiak and contains an EDIT macro     *   FILE 978
//*           that mimics the ISPF 'MODEL' command, but GENIE       *   FILE 978
//*           is extensible and serves up WISHes from user          *   FILE 978
//*           created templates.  This is a beta version, after     *   FILE 978
//*           File 972, which was the first published version.      *   FILE 978
//*                                                                 *   FILE 978

//*           This release is an update of File 972 which Ken       *   FILE 978
//*           had been working on, after File 972 was published     *   FILE 978
//*           here.  Since unfortunately, Ken has passed away,      *   FILE 978
//*           but he kept working almost to the last minute, this   *   FILE 978
//*           file is probably good, but I don't really know, and   *   FILE 978
//*           I'm putting it out as a beta version, until someone   *   FILE 978
//*           will test it and prove it to be reliable.  (SBG)      *   FILE 978
//*           (Then we'll probably replace File 972 with it.)       *   FILE 978

//*           The administrator will create one or more WISHLIST    *   FILE 978
//*           data sets referenced by the GENIE edit macro that is  *   FILE 978

//*           The end user (developers) invokes GENIE on the        *   FILE 978
