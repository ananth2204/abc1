NChapter 6: SNAP Dump
N--------------------
NA SNAP dump shows virtual storage areas that a program, while running,
Nrequests the system to dump. A SNAP dump, therefore, is written while a
Nprogram runs, rather than during abnormal end. The program can ask for
Na dump of as little as a one byte field to as much as all of the
Nstorage assigned to the current job step. The program can also ask for
Nsome system data in the dump.
N
NA SNAP dump is especially useful when testing a program. A program can
Ndump one or more fields repeatedly to let the programmer check
Nintermediate steps in calculations. For example, if a program being
Ndeveloped produces incorrect results, requests for SNAP dumps can be
NAdded to the program to dump individual variables. The first time that
Nincorrect storage is encountered should narrow down the section of code
Ncausing the error.
