NExample 3: Copy and Replace Selected Members of a Data Set
N----------------------------------------------------------
NIn this example, two members (A and B) are selected from two input
Npartitioned data sets (DATASET5 and DATASET6) and copied to an existing
Noutput partitioned data set (DATASET1). Member B replaces an
Nidentically named member that already exists on the output data set.

NThe control statements are discussed below:
N
N  OUT1 DD defines a partitioned data set (DATASET1), which contains
N  three members (A, B and F).
N
N  IN6 DD defines a partitioned data set (DATASET6), which contains
N  three members (B, C and D).
N
N  IN5 DD defines a partitioned data set (DATASET5), which contains
N  two members (A and C).
N
N  SYSUT3 and SYSUT4 DD define temporary spill data sets. One track is
N  allocated for each on a disk volume.
N
N  SYSIN DD defines the control data set, which follows in the input
N  stream. The data set contains a COPY statement, an INDD statement,
N  and a SELECT statement.
N
N  COPY indicates the start of the copy operation. The use of a SELECT
N  statement causes a selective copy. The OUTDD parameter specifies
N  DATASET1 as the output data set.
N
N  INDD specifies DATASET5 as the first input data set to be processed
N  and DATASET6 as the second input data set to be processed.
N  Processing occurs as follows:
M
M  1. Selected members are searched for on DATASET5.
M
M  2. Member A is found, but is not copied to DATASET1 because DATASET1
M     already has a member named "A", and the replace option is not
M     specified for member A.
M
M  3. Selected members not found on DATASET5 are searched for on
M     DATASET6.
M
M  4. Member B is found and copied to DATASET1, even though there is
M     already a DATASET1 member "B" in DATASET1, because the replace
M     option is specified for member B on the member level. The pointer
M     in DATASET1's directory is changed to point to the new (copied)
M     member B; thus, the space occupied by the old member B is unused.
M
N  SELECT specifies the members to be selected from the input data sets
N  (DATASET5 and DATASET6) to be copied to the output data set
N  (DATASET1).
