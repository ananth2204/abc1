NChapter 19: Dump suppression
N----------------------------
NThe system requests dumps you might not need. To keep from using your
Nsystem's resources on unneeded dumps, you should suppress them. The
Nreasons for the unneeded dumps and ways to suppress them are:
N
N-> Duplicate dumps: The system can request a dump for a problem that
N   recurs. The dump written when the problem first occurs can be used
N   for diagnosis; additional dumps are unneeded. Also, sometimes a
N   system can request several dumps for one instance of a problem. A
N   recurring problem may have been diagnosed, but the fix not yet
M   incorporated into the system.
N
N-> Dumps for certain abend codes: For some abend codes, the
N   accompany messages provide the needed problem data. To eliminate
N   the dumps for these abend codes, use a SLIP command.
N
N-> A dump for an abend in an application program: if the dump is not
N   needed.
N
N-> Dumps the installation decides are not needed: If you decide that
N   certain dumps are not needed, you can code a routine for an
N   installation exit to suppress these dumps.
