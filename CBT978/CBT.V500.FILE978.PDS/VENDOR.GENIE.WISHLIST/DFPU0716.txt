NExample 16: Build a New Graphic Character Modification Module and
NModify a Character Arrangement Table to Use It
N-----------------------------------------------------------------
N3800 Model 3
N
NIn this example, a graphic character modification module is built. The
Nmodule contains one user-designed character, a reverse 'E', whose 8-bit
Ndata code is designated as X'E0' and whose pitch is 10. An existing
Ncharacter arrangement table is then modified to include the reverse E.

NThe control statements are discussed below:
N
N  The SYSUT1 DD statement includes DISP=OLD to ensure that no other
N  job can modify the data set while this job is executing.
N
N  DEVICE=3800M3 in the OPTION statement preceding the GRAPHIC
N  statement specifies 3800 Model 3 compatibility mode processing.
N
N  The GRAPHIC statement's ASSIGN parameter establishes the 8-bit data
N  code, X'E0', and the width, 10-pitch, for the user-designed
N  character. The data statements that follow the GRAPHIC statement
N  describe the character's scan pattern.
N
N  The name of the graphic character modification module is BODE, and
N  it is stored as a new module in the SYS1.IMAGELIB data set.
N
N  The INCLUDE statement specifies that a copy of the GS10 character
N  arrangement table is to be used as the basis for the new table.
N
N  The TABLE statement specifies the addition of the reverse E to that
N  copy of the GS10 table.
N
N  CGMID=(83,FF) specifies the character set identifier X'83' for the
N  Gothic-10 set (which is the set already used by the GS10 table) and
N  specifies X'FF' as a character set identifier to allow accessing of
N  the second WCGM without loading it.
N
N  GCMLIST=BODE identifies the graphic character modification module
N  containing the reverse E for inclusion in the table. LOC=(E0,03,1)
N  specifies that the reverse E, which has been assigned the 8-bit data
N  code X'E0', is to be loaded into position X'03' in the second WCGM.
N  Because this second WCGM is otherwise unused, any position in it
N  could have been used for the reverse E.
N
N  The new character arrangement table is named RE10; it is stored as a
N  new module in the SYS1.IMAGELIB data set.
