NChapter 34. TYPETERM resources
N------------------------------
NWhen you specify the DEVICE, SESSIONTYPE and TERMMODEL in a TYPETERM
Ndefinition, CICS supplies default values for many of the other
Nattributes.
N
NThe default values are shown in Table 14 (IN THE MANUAL). Note that
Nfor some attributes, the supplied values are mandatory, and you
Ncannot change them.
N
NSyntax:
N-------
D  DEFINE
D    TYPETERM(name)
I      Specifies the name of this extension of a TERMINAL
I      definition. The name can be up to eight characters in length.
N
I      This name is referred to in all the TERMINAL definitions using this
I      TYPETERM. Note that this TYPETERM definition must be installed
I      before or at the same time as the TERMINAL definitions that
I      reference it.
N
D    GROUP(groupname)
I      Every resource definition must have a GROUP name.
I      The resource definition becomes a member of the group and is
I      installed in the CICS system when the group is installed.
N
I      The GROUP name can be up to 8 characters in length. Lowercase
I      characters are treated as uppercase characters.
N
D    DESCRIPTION(text)
I      You can provide a description of the resource that
I      you are defining in this field. The description text can be up to
I      58 characters in length. No restrictions apply to the characters
I      that you can use. However, if you use parentheses, ensure that for
I      each left parenthesis there is a matching right parenthesis. If you
I      use the CREATE command, for each single apostrophe in the text,
I      code two apostrophes.
N
D    ASCII({NO|7|8})
I      Specifies whether the terminal has an ASCII feature.
N
I      NO: This terminal does not have an ASCII feature.
N
I      7: Specify this value to communicate with ASCII-7 terminals.
I        Devices configured with the ASCII-7 feature must be LUTYPE2 or
I        LUTYPE3 without extended 3270 features. Only the following
I        devices are supported:
N
I        3274 Model 1C and 51C
I        3276 Model 12
I        3278
I        3287
N
I        Any terminal configured with the ASCII-7 option has all FM data
I        outbound from CICS converted to ASCII-7, and all FM data inbound
I        to CICS converted to EBCDIC. Only FM request data is translated.
I        All other data in the RU such as LU status or sense data is
I        assumed to be in EBCDIC on output. ASCII-7 does not support data
I        streams that contain extended attributes, such as structured
I        fields and function management headers.
N
I        The ASCII-7 support is available on 3274-1C as an option on the
I        configuration of the standard microcode. The use of the ASCII-7
I        option is determined at session initiation by BIND parameters
I        set by CICS as a result of the TCT definition described.
N
I      8: Specify this to communicate with ASCII-8 terminals. Devices
I        configured with the ASCII-8 feature can be LUTYPE1, LUTYPE2, or
I        LUTYPE3 with or without extended 3270 and SCS data stream
I        features.
N
I        Any terminal configured with the ASCII-8 option has all FM data
I        outbound from CICS converted to ASCII-8, and all FM data inbound
I        to CICS converted to EBCDIC. All FM request data is translated.
I        This includes the AID, cursor address, FM headers and structured
I        fields.
N
I        Any other form of the RU such as LU status or sense data is
I        assumed to be in EBCDIC on input and is transmitted in EBCDIC
I        on output.
N
I        This ASCII-8 support is intended only for devices that operate
I        in EBCDIC but translate or retranslate the data stream to or from
I        ASCII-8, as is done by this CICS support. This is because the
I        data stream is treated as a character string, and any binary
I        number fields are translated byte by byte as though they were
I        graphic characters. Thus they may not represent their true
I        value while in ASCII form.
N
I        The ASCII-8 support is available as a microcode RPQ on the 3274
I        and is mutually exclusive with the ASCII-7 option. The use of
I        the ASCII-8 option is determined at session initiation by BIND
I        parameters set by CICS as a result of the TCT definitions
I        described.
N
D    ATI(NO | YES)
I      Specifies whether transactions can start at the
I      terminal by automatic transaction initiation:
N
I      YES: Transactions can start at the terminal by automatic
I        transaction initiation.
N
I      NO: Transactions cannot start at the terminal by automatic
I        transaction initiation.
N
I      ATI(YES) allows transactions to be started at the terminal by
I      transient data control or by an EXEC CICS START command issued by
I      another transaction. If there is already a transaction at the
I      terminal, the ATI transaction is held until it ends. If you
I      specify ATI(YES), you must specify an IOAREALEN of at least one
I      byte, except for DEVICE(APPC) when ATI and IOAREALEN have forced
I      default values of YES and 0.
N
I      If ATI is specified as YES and CREATESESS is specified as YES,
I      and if a transaction is initiated when the terminal is not
I      ACQUIRED, it is automatically acquired.
N
I      See also the TTI attribute.
N
D    AUTOCONNECT(NO | ALL | YES)
I      Specifies whether autoconnect processing
I      is to occur for the terminal. AUTOCONNECT(YES) or (ALL) specifies
I      that the session with the terminal is to be established (that is,
I      BIND is to be performed) during CICS initialization, or when
I      communication with z/OS Communications Server is started using
I      the SET VTAM OPEN command. If the connection cannot be made at
I      this time because the terminal is unavailable, the link must be
I      subsequently acquired using the
I      CEMT SET TERMINAL(termid) INSERVICE ACQUIRED command, unless the
I      terminal becomes available in the meantime and itself initiates
I      communications.
N
I      Note: If you use the z/OS Communications Server LOGAPPL function,
I      do not specify AUTOCONNECT(YES), because this can lead to race
I      conditions causing errors or hung logical units.
N
I      NO: CICS does not attempt to bind sessions when the connection is
I        established.
N
I      YES: CICS attempts to bind as a contention winner session, when
I        the connection is established.
N
I      ALL: Not applicable.
N
I      For background information about AUTOCONNECT, see Defining
I      intercommunication resources in Developing applications.
N
D    BRACKET(YES | NO)
I      Specifies whether bracket protocol is to be
I      enforced for this logical unit. The default depends on the value
I      you specify for the DEVICE attribute (see "Default values for
I      TYPETERM attributes").
N
I      YES: Bracket protocol is to be used. This option is required for
I        the 3790 inquiry and full function logical units. BRACKET(YES)
I        is forced for many DEVICE types
N
I      NO: Bracket protocol is not to be used. You must specify
I        BRACKET(NO) for a 3614 logical unit and the 3650 Host Command
I        Processor (HCP) session.
N
I      Bracket protocol is a feature of SNA; if you specify BRACKET(YES)
I      for non-SNA devices, CICS will neither follow, nor enforce,
I      strict bracket protocol.
N
D    BUILDCHAIN(NO | YES)
I      Specifies whether CICS is to perform chain
I      assembly before passing the input data to the application program.
N
I      The default depends on the value you specify for the DEVICE
I      attribute.
N
I      NO: Any terminal input/output area (TIOA) received by an
I        application program from this logical unit contains one request
I        unit (RU).
N
I      YES: Any TIOA received by an application program from this logical
I        unit contains a complete chain.
N
D    CREATESESS(NO | YES)
I      Specifies whether sessions are to be created.
N
I      NO: Specify this to prevent internally generated session requests
I        from creating a session. During CICS execution, this can be
I        changed only by a CEMT command.
N
I        CREATESESS(NO) prevents EXEC START requests and automatic
I        transaction initiation (ATI) requests for this terminal causing
I        a session to be created. This means that the requests are either
I        queued or rejected when no session is currently established.
N
I      YES: Specify this for a status that allows internally generated
I        session requests to create a session. During CICS execution,
I        this status can be generated only by a CEMT command.
N
I        CREATESESS(YES) allows EXEC START requests and automatic
I        transaction initiation (ATI) requests for this terminal to cause
I        a session to be created automatically.
N
D    DEVICE(char8)
I      Specifies the device type which this TYPETERM
I      defines. This attribute is mandatory for all TYPETERM definitions.
N
I      If you type DEVICE(xxxx), where xxxx is a valid device type, on
I      the command line, together with SESSIONTYPE and TERMMODEL if
I      appropriate, other attributes are given appropriate default values.
I      For further guidance, see "Default values for TYPETERM attributes".
I      Entering or overtyping the DEVICE, SESSIONTYPE, or TERMMODEL values
I      on the overtype-to-modify panel does not provide these defaults.
N
I      The valid attributes and the defaults for each device type are
I      listed in "Default values for TYPETERM attributes". The recommended
I      attributes for non-SNA z/OS Communications Server 3270 devices are
I      3270 and 3270P for displays and printers, respectively. The
I      following attributes can also be specified and are retained for
I      compatibility with previous releases:
N
I      -> Displays: 3277 and L3277
N
I      -> Printers: 3284 and L3284, 3286 and L3286
N
I      For SNA z/OS Communications Server 3270 devices, use the LUTYPE2
I      or LUTYPE3 attribute as appropriate. LUTYPE2 logical units are
I      those defined by SNA, which accept a 3270-display data stream.
I      LUTYPE3 logical units are those defined by SNA, which accept a
I      data stream similar to that for a 3270 printer.
N
I      For a list of device types supported by CICS, see "DFHTCT: CICS
I      terminals list". See also "Default values for TYPETERM attributes"
I      for a list of valid device names and the default attributes that
I      they generate.
N
D    DISCREQ(YES | NO)
I      Specifies whether disconnect requests are to be
I      honored.
N
I      YES: CICS is to honor a disconnect request for a z/OS
I        Communications Server device, and issue a z/OS Communications
I        Server CLSDST macroinstruction to terminate the
I        z/OS Communications Server session with that logical unit.
N
I        In addition, CESF LOGOFF or GOODNIGHT from the terminal causes
I        disconnection if you specify YES.
N
I        YES is essential if the TYPETERM definition is referenced by
I        AUTINSTMODEL TERMINAL definitions, so that autoinstalled terminal
I        entries can be deleted automatically.
N
I        YES is the default, but in some situations, if your resource
I        definition does not specify this attribute, CICS enforces the
I        NO value for the attribute if this value is required for
I        compatibility with other options in your resource definition.
N
I      NO: CICS is not to honor a disconnect request for a
I        z/OS Communications Server device.
N
D    IOAREALEN(0,0 | value1,value2)
I      Specifies the length in bytes of
I      a terminal input/output area to be passed to a transaction.
N
I      If you specify ATI(YES), you must specify an IOAREALEN of at least
I      one byte.
N
I      value1: Value1 specifies the minimum size of a terminal
I        input/output area to be passed to an application program when a
I        RECEIVE command is issued.
N
I      value2: You can specify value2 as greater than or equal to value1.
I        In this case, when the size of an input message exceeds value1,
I        CICS uses a terminal input/output area value2 bytes long. If the
I        input message size also exceeds value2, the node abnormal
I        condition program sends an exception response to the terminal.
N
I        If value2 is not specified, or is less than value1, it defaults
I        to the value of value1.
N
I      The maximum value that you can specify for IOAREALEN is
I      32767 bytes.
N
D    LDCLIST(list)
I      Specifies the name of a logical device code (LDC)
I      list. The name can be up to eight characters in length. The name
I      follows assembler language rules. It must start with an
I      alphabetic character.
N
I      Define the LDCLIST and its contents using macroinstruction(s).
N
I      A local LDC list is defined by:
N
I        listname DFHTCT TYPE=LDCLIST,
I        LDC(aa=nnn,bb=nnn,....)
N
I      An extended local LDC list is defined by:
N
I        listname DFHTCT TYPE=LDC,LOCAL=INITIAL
I                 DFHTCT TYPE=LDC=(aa=nnn)....
I                 DFHTCT TYPE=LDC=(bb=nnn)....
I                 DFHTCT TYPE=LDC,LOCAL=FINAL
N
I      You specify this listname as the value for the LDCLIST attribute
I      on the TYPETERM definition.
N
I      This attribute applies only to 3600, 3770 batch, 3770, and 3790
I      batch data interchange, and LUTYPE4 logical units. The list
I      specifies which LDCs are valid for this logical unit and,
I      optionally, which device characteristics are valid for each LDC.
I      CICS uses the first LDC generated in this list when choosing a
I      default LDC for a logical unit. For further guidance, see
I      "DFHTCT logical device codes: z/OS Communications Server non-3270".
N
D    LOGMODE(logmode | 0)
I      Specifies how CICS is to build the BIND
I      to be sent to the logical unit. blank A defined terminal definition
I      uses the BIND image generated by the CICS definitions for this
I      device by means of this TYPETERM definition and its associated
I      terminal definitions. An autoinstalled terminal uses the fields
I      specified in the incoming CINIT.
N
I      name: This is the LOGMODE name from a z/OS Communications Server
I        logon mode table that has been set up for use by this logical
I        unit. The name may be up to eight characters in length and must
I        follow assembler language rules. The name must start with an
I        alphabetic character.
N
I        This allows you to override the BIND image provided by CICS for
I        the logical unit. For further information, see the appropriate
I        CICS subsystem guide.
N
I        You cannot code a LOGMODE name when the terminal is a
I        cross-domain resource.
N
I        The TCTTE is updated to reflect the logmode bind image fields.
I        These include SEND and RECEIVE sizes and default and alternate
I        screen sizes. If the logmode indicates that the terminal is not
I        queriable, the extended data stream fields are all set to zero.
N
I      0 (zero): This causes CICS to use some of the information from the
I        BIND image contained in the CINIT coming from the logical unit.
I        The BIND image in the CINIT was created by z/OS Communications
I        Server based on the LOGMODE entry defined for the logical unit
I        requesting to log on to CICS. The node initialization block (NIB)
I        is built with LOGMODE=0 and BNDAREA=0. When the TYPETERM's
I        SENDSIZE and RECEIVESIZE have been specified as zero, CICS
I        replaces them with the values from the LOGMODE's RUSIZES.
N
I        The TCTTE is updated to reflect the incoming CINIT fields. These
I        include SEND and RECEIVE sizes and default and alternate screen
I        sizes. If the logmode indicates that the terminal is not
I        queriable, the extended data stream fields are all set to 0. Use
I        LOGMODE(0) only in exceptional circumstances. Although the LU
I        is bound with the z/OS Communications Server definition, CICS
I        keeps the main session characteristics from the CICS definition.
I        For example, if a printer is defined to z/OS Communications
I        Server as LUTYPE1 but to CICS as an LUTYPE3 with LOGMODE(0),
I        CICS accepts the bind but sends LUTYPE3 control characters to
I        the printer, giving rise to incorrect results. This restriction
I        does not apply to pipeline terminals.
N
I        Note:
I        1. You should only need to use this value for the logmode
I           attribute in exceptional circumstances.
N
I        2. For a logical unit in a cross-domain environment, specify
I           LOGMODE(0) and provide the logical unit mode information in
I           the DLOGMOD and MODETAB operands of the z/OS Communications
I           Server(LU) statement. In a cross-domain environment, LOGMODE
I           with a name causes a z/OS Communications Server error.
N
I    LOGMODECOM: This attribute is obsolete, but is supported to provide
I      compatibility with earlier releases of CICS.
N
D    LOGONMSG(NO | YES)
I      Specifies whether the 'good morning' transaction,
I      specified in the GMTRAN system initialization parameter, will be:
N
I      -> Automatically initiated when the logical unit is first logged
I         on to CICS through z/OS Communications Server.
N
I      -> Initiated after the terminal user's TIMEOUT period has expired
I         under certain conditions.
N
I      If you have specified ERRLASTLINE(YES), the messages written by
I      the transaction do not overwrite the error message line.
N
I      NO: CICS does not run the 'good morning' transaction.
N
I        Note: If you are using a non-SNA terminal such as a Telnet 3270,
I        LOGONMSG(NO) does not automatically release the keyboard lock.
I        You need to press the Reset key to release the keyboard lock.
N
I      YES: CICS runs the 'good morning' transaction when the OPNDST exit
I        is successfully completed and a session is established. The
I        transaction is initiated by automatic task initiation (ATI) and
I        competes with other ATI transactions for use of the terminal.
I        Specify ATI(YES) for this TYPETERM.
N
I        Note: If you are using a non-SNA terminal such as a Telnet 3270,
I        LOGONMSG(YES) also automatically releases the keyboard lock.
N
D    NEPCLASS(0 | tranclass)
I      Specifies the node error program
I      transaction class.
N
I      0: This results in a link to the default node error program module.
N
I      tranclass: The transaction class for the (nondefault) node error
I        program module. tranclass can be in the range 1 through 255.
I        For programming information about the node error program, see
I        Writing a node error program in Developing system programs.
N
D    OBOPERID(NO | YES)
I      Specifies whether CICS uses the outboard operator
I      identifiers to support the BMS routing facilities required for
I      this terminal. This option applies only to the 3790 and 3770 batch
I      data interchange logical units.
N
I      NO: CICS does not use the outboard operator identifiers.
N
I      YES: CICS uses the outboard operator identifiers.
N
D    PAGESIZE(rows,columns)
I      Specifies the default page size for this
I      printer. The default page size is used by BMS when the default
I      screen size has been selected in the DEFSCREEN attribute.
N
I      rows: Indicates the number of rows in the page. The PAGESIZE rows
I        value can usefully be less than the DEFSCREEN rows value,
I        perhaps to reserve the bottom line of a screen for error messages
I        (see the ERRLASTLINE attribute), if the same BMS map is being
I        used for both printing and display.
N
I      columns: Indicates the number of characters in each line.
I        Unexpected results occur if the columns value specified in
I        PAGESIZE differs from the columns value specified in DEFSCREEN.
N
I      The product of rows and columns must not exceed 32767.
N
I      The default value depends on the value you specify for the DEVICE
I      attribute.
N
I      See "Default values for TYPETERM attributes" for details.
N
I      BMS uses the page size values when preparing output data streams.
I      The specified number of characters in each line of the page should
I      not exceed the physical line width of the terminal. In the case of
I      printers that automatically perform a new-line function on reaching
I      the end of the carriage (for example, 3270 printers), the line
I      width specified here should be less than the physical line width.
N
I      This ensures that the formatting of the output data is governed
I      entirely by the new-line (NL) characters supplied by BMS or by you,
I      not by new-line functions performed by the device itself, which
I      would produce additional lines of output, resulting in a physical
I      page depth greater than that specified here.
N
I      For 3270-type printers, the hardware limits the amount of data
I      that BMS may transmit. If the map or application program request
I      specifies L40, L64, or L80, or does not specify NLEOM on the
I      SEND MAP command, the product of lines and columns specified in
I      PAGESIZE must not be greater than the buffer size.
N
I      If the BMS request specifies NLEOM, the page length may be any
I      number of lines, but the product of lines and columns specified
I      in the DEFSCREEN or ALTSCREEN attributes must not exceed the
I      buffer size of the device. In other words, the number of characters
I      that BMS transmits must not exceed the physical buffer size of
I      the printer.
N
I      Note: BMS divides a large page into smaller segments for
I      transmission. PAGESIZE should therefore correspond to the required
I      logical page size (the product of lines and columns), and the
I      DEFSCREEN value should correspond to the actual buffer size.
N
I      For a z/OS Communications Server 3600, the PAGESIZE specified is
I      used if a BMS page build operation is attempted without specifying
I      a logical device code (LDC). A default device type of 3604 is
I      assumed.
N
I      For 3770, LUTYPE4, or 3790 batch data interchange logical units,
I      the PAGESIZE specified is used if a BMS page build operation is
I      requested without specifying a logical device code (LDC). The
I      default device type is the console printer.
N
I      Take care when routing a message to a list of terminals. If the
I      PAGESIZE you have defined (or allowed to default) is too small to
I      accommodate the message, the transaction abends.
N
I      For cumulative text processing, the maximum allowed buffer size
I      is 32767. If this is exceeded, BMS internally forces a reduced
I      page length to ensure that the PAGESIZE stays within the limit.
N
D    RECEIVESIZE(number)
I      For a defined nonautoinstalled terminal,
I      specify the maximum size of a request unit that can satisfy a
I      z/OS Communications Server RECEIVE request. The RECEIVESIZE value
I      is transmitted to the connected logical unit, and must be in the
I      range 0 through 30720. It may be rounded down by CICS, because it
I      must be transmitted in an architected form.
N
I      The effect of RECEIVESIZE depends on whether a RECEIVE RUSIZE is
I      present in the z/OS Communications Server LOGMODE table. Table 16
I      (IN THE MANUAL) shows the RECEIVE RUSIZE used to bind a session for
I      each possible combination of TYPETERM and LOGMODE values.
N
I      APPC terminal For an APPC (LUTYPE6.2) single session terminal,
I      256 would be a suitable value.
N
I      Autoinstalled terminal For an autoinstalled terminal, a nonzero
I      value for RECEIVESIZE specifies either the maximum or actual
I      RECEIVE RUSIZE value used in binding a session for a logical unit
I      defined with this TYPETERM.
N
I      The effect of RECEIVESIZE depends on whether a RECEIVE RUSIZE is
I      present in the z/OS Communications Server LOGMODE table. Table 17
I      (IN THE MANUAL) shows the RECEIVE RUSIZE used to bind a session
I      for each possible combination of TYPETERM and LOGMODE values.
N
I    RELREQ({NO|YES})
I      Specifies whether CICS is to release the logical
I      unit upon request by another z/OS Communications Server
I      application program.
N
I      NO: CICS is not to release the logical unit.
N
I      YES: CICS is to release the logical unit, if the logical unit is
I        not currently part of a transaction.
N
D    RSTSIGNOFF(NOFORCE | FORCE)
I      Specifies whether the terminal user
I      should be signed off in the event of a persistent sessions restart
I      or an XRF takeover.
N
I      FORCE: The terminal will be signed off after a persistent sessions
I        restart or XRF takeover.
N
I      NOFORCE: The terminal will remain signed on after a persistent
I        sessions restart or XRF takeover, provided that the RSTSIGNOFF
I        system initialization parameter and the XRFSOFF entry in the CICS
I        segment of the RACF user profile are both set to NOFORCE.
N
D    SENDSIZE(number)
I      Defined terminal (nonautoinstalled): For a
I      nonautoinstalled terminal, this is the maximum size in bytes of a
I      request unit that can satisfy a z/OS Communications Server
I      VTAM SEND request. The SENDSIZE value is transmitted to the
I      connected logical unit, and must be in the range 0 through 30720.
I      It may be rounded down by CICS, because it must be transmitted in
I      an architected form.
N
I      The effect of SENDSIZE depends on whether a SEND RUSIZE is present
I      in the z/OS Communications Server LOGMODE table. Table 18 (IN THE
I      MANUAL) shows the SEND RUSIZE used to bind a session for each
I      possible combination of TYPETERM and LOGMODE values.
N
I      APPC terminal: For an APPC (LUTYPE6.2) single session terminal,
I      256 is a suitable value.
N
I      Autoinstalled terminal: For an autoinstalled terminal, a nonzero
I      value for SENDSIZE specifies either the maximum or actual
I      SEND RUSIZE value used in binding a session for a logical unit
I      defined with this TYPETERM.
N
I      The effect of SENDSIZE depends on whether a SEND RUSIZE is present
I      in the z/OS Communications Server LOGMODE table. Table 19 (IN THE
I      MANUAL) shows the SEND RUSIZE used to bind a session for each
I      possible combination of TYPETERM and LOGMODE values.
N
D    SESSIONTYPE(type)
I      Specifies the type of session that can be used for
I      a z/OS Communications Server SNA logical unit. For details, see
I      "Default values for TYPETERM attributes".
N
D    SHIPPABLE(NO | YES)
I      Specifies whether the definition is allowed to
I      be sent to a remote system if this device tries to initiate a
I      remote transaction.
N
I      NO: This definition cannot be shipped to a remote system.
N
I      YES: This definition can be shipped to a remote system.
N
I        This function may be used for any terminal, whether autoinstalled
I        or with its own TERMINAL definition. The shipping does not work
I        unless the terminal has a definition installed, by one of these
I        methods, in the local system. Using SHIPPABLE(YES) means that
I        you do not need to ensure that a definition of the terminal
I        exists on the remote system for a locally defined terminal to
I        initiate a transaction in that system. This can be useful when
I        the remote system cannot share the CSD file with the local
I        system.
N
I       A definition for the terminal must already be installed in (or
I       already shipped to) the remote system.
N
I       For guidance on deciding whether to use SHIPPABLE(YES), see
I       "Terminals for transaction routing".
N
D    SIGNOFF(YES | NO | LOGOFF)
I      Specifies the actions taken when GNTRAN
I      (CESF or user-defined transaction) is attached and attempts to
I      sign off the terminal. If you are using RACF 1.9 or later, specify
I      the TIMEOUT limit in the RACF segment.
N
I      YES: When the specified time has elapsed after the last input from
I        the operator, the terminal is automatically signed off from CICS.
N
I      NO: The terminal is not timed out.
N
I      LOGOFF: When the specified time has elapsed after the last input
I        from the operator, the terminal is automatically signed off from
I        CICS and then logged off from z/OS Communications Server. LOGOFF
I        is useful for an autoinstall model, because virtual storage is
I        not wasted on entries for terminals that have been timed out.
N
I        If GNTRAN fails to attach because of unprocessed data in the
I        terminal buffer (resulting in a BID failure), the terminal will
I        be signed off and logged off. GNTRAN will not run and will have
I        no effect.
N
I        Note: You cannot change the value of this attribute when
I        DEVICE(APPC) is specified. The default value in that case is
I        SIGNOFF(NO).
N
D    TERMMODEL(1 | 2)
I      Specifies the model number of the terminal. If the
I      device is a component of the 3270 Information Display System,
I      specify the model number of the terminal:
N
I      1: Specify 1 for the 3270 Model 1 displays and printers (for
I        example, 3277 Model 1) with a default screen or buffer size
I        of 12x40 (480 bytes/characters). TERMMODEL(1) is the default
I        for 3270 Model 1 printers and displays.
N
I        Specify 1 for the 3275 Display Station Model 11. The CICS support
I        obtained is identical to that obtained by coding TERMMODEL(1) for
I        3275 Display Station Model 1.
N
I      2 Specify 2 for the 3270 displays and printers (for example,
I        3278 Model 4) with a default screen or buffer size of
I        24x80 (1920 bytes/characters). TERMMODEL(2) is the default for
I        the 3286 printer in 3270 compatibility mode.
N
I       Specify 2 for the 3275 Display Station Model 12. The CICS support
I       obtained is identical to that obtained by coding TERMMODEL(2) for
I       3275 Display Station Model 2.
N
D    TTI(YES | NO)
I      Specifies whether transactions can be initiated at
I      the terminal by a user.
N
I      YES: Transactions can be initiated at the terminal by a user. If
I        you also specify ATI(YES), transactions can also be initiated
I        automatically. In this case, the automatic transaction
I        initiation, either by transient data control or interval control,
I        sets a condition in an appropriate terminal control table
I        terminal entry. If both ATI and TTI are specified as YES, and if
I        there is no transaction at the terminal, terminal control
I        initiates the user-defined task. This task is expected to send
I        messages to the terminal.
N
I        For a terminal used in the processing of transactions such as
I        inquiries or order entries, specify TTI(YES) and ATI(NO). This
I        also applies to a display station or hard-copy terminal to which
I        no messages are sent without a terminal request and through which
I        transactions are entered. Note that this is the only
I        specification allowed for 3790 inquiry logical units.
N
I      NO: Transactions cannot be initiated at the terminal by a user. If
I        you specify NO, specify ATI(YES) to allow transactions to be
I        initiated automatically. An example of this type of terminal is
I        one that is located in a remote location, such as a warehouse,
I        and is unattended but may receive messages.
N
D    UCTRAN(NO | TRANID | YES)
I      Specifies whether the input data stream from
I      a terminal is to be translated to uppercase. The input data stream
I      may include a transaction identifier as well as program data. CICS
I      supports transaction identifier definition in mixed case, and the
I      UCTRAN attribute can be used to ensure that the correct transaction
I      is located. Uppercase translation is done for both 3270 and
I      non-3270 data streams.
N
I      NO: No uppercase translation is performed.
N
I      YES: All the data input from the terminal, both the transaction
I        identifier if present and the program data, is translated to
I        uppercase before any processing.
N
I      TRANID: When the input data stream includes a transaction
I        identifier, CICS translates it to uppercase before attempting to
I        locate its definition. However, all the input data, both the
I        transaction identifier and the program data, is passed to the
I        program without any translation.
N
I        Therefore both the YES and the TRANID options allow transaction
I        identifiers to be defined in uppercase and to be entered from the
I        terminal in either uppercase or lowercase, but the TRANID option
I        causes the transaction identifier and program data to be passed
I        to the program without any translation.
N
I      You can also request translation to uppercase at the transaction
I      level on PROFILE resources (see "PROFILE attributes"), but be aware
I      that a TYPETERM UCTRAN(YES) definition overrides a
I      PROFILE UCTRAN(NO) definition. So, if you specify
I      TYPETERM UCTRAN(YES), a PROFILE UCTRAN(NO) has no effect.
I      Translation can be overridden by the application program for all
I      RECEIVE requests except the first, by using the ASIS option.
N
I      Table 20 (IN THE MANUAL) shows which portion of the terminal input
I      is translated (transaction id and/or data) according to the setting
I      of the UCTRAN on the PROFILE and TYPETERM resource definitions.
N
I      Some national-language characters are not automatically translated
I      when UCTRAN(YES) or UCTRAN(TRANID) is specified. If that is the
I      case, you can use one of the methods described in Upper translation
I      in Reference System programming.
N
D    USERAREALEN(0 | 0-255)
I      Specifies the length in bytes (0 to 255) of
I      the user area for this terminal. It should be made as small as
I      possible. The terminal user area is initialized to zeros at
I      system initialization.
N
I      The terminal user area might be located in 31-bit storage or in
I      24-bit storage, depending on the value of the TCTUALOC system
I      initialization parameter. The default is that the terminal user
I      area can be in either 31-bit storage or 24-bit storage, but CICS
I      uses 31-bit storage wherever possible. If you require the terminal
I      user area to be in 24-bit storage, because you have application
I      programs that are not capable of 31-bit addressing, specify the
I      system initialization parameter TCTUALOC=BELOW for the CICS region.
N
I    XRFSIGNOFF: This attribute is obsolete, but is supported to provide
I      compatibility with earlier releases of CICS.
N
NNBMS-related attributes:
N------------------------
D    ALTPAGE(0,0 | rows,columns)
I      Specifies the page size to be used by
I      BMS for this terminal entry when ALTSCREEN has been selected as the
I      screen size. The default is the PAGESIZE. The values for both rows
I      and columns must be in the range 0 through 999. The product of rows
I      and columns must not exceed 32767.
N
I      You will get unexpected results if the columns value of ALTPAGE is
I      different from that of ALTSCREEN. The rows value of ALTPAGE can use
I      fully be less than that of ALTSCREEN, perhaps to reserve the bottom
I      line of the screen for error messages.
N
I      If you use the QUERY structured field, the alternate page size used
I      is the size set up as the alternate screen size. For terminals that
I      can be queried, you can set ALTPAGE to zero and have the ALTSCREEN
I      value defined explicitly by the CINIT BIND. If ALTPAGE is not zero,
I      it is possible to have different values for the ALTPAGE and the
I      ALTSCREEN.
N
D    ALTSUFFIX(char1)
I      A 1-character numeric suffix that BMS is
I      to append to map set names (specified in the SUFFIX operand of the
I      DFHMSD TYPE={DSECT|MAP} macro).
N
I      blank: Leave this attribute blank if you do not want a suffixed
I        map set.
N
I      number: BMS appends this suffix to map set names if the screen size
I        being used is the same value as the alternate screen size; that
I        is, if the transaction has an alternate screen size specified in
I        the PROFILE definition, or if the default and alternate screen
I        size are the same. In this case, BMS map selection routines
I        attempt to load the map set with the suffix specified in the
I        ALTSUFFIX operand.
N
I      If there is no such map set, BMS tries to load a map set suffixed
I      with M or L and, if this load fails, BMS tries to load an
I      unsuffixed map set version.
N
I      If the transaction uses default screen size, BMS first tries to
I      load a map set suffixed with M or L and, if this load fails, BMS
I      tries to load an unsuffixed map set version.
N
I      To use a suffixed map set, you must specify the BMS=(,,,DDS)
I      system initialization parameter.
N
D    AUTOPAGE(NO | YES)
I      Specifies whether BMS autopaging is to be used.
I      Specify YES for printers and NO for display devices. The default
I      depends on the value you specify for the DEVICE attribute. The
I      default values are indicated in "Default values for TYPETERM
I      attributes".
N
D    FMHPARM(NO | YES)
I      Specifies whether BMS is to accept user-supplied
I      parameters for inclusion in the function management header built
I      by BMS:
N
I      NO: Do not accept user-supplied parameters for inclusion in the
I        function management header built by BMS.
N
I      YES: Accept user-supplied parameters for inclusion in the function
I        management header built by BMS.
N
I      Specify YES only if the DEVICE type is 3650.
N
D    ROUTEDMSGS(ALL | NONE | SPECIFIC)
I      Specifies which messages are to be
I      routed to this terminal by an EXEC CICS ROUTE command. The default
I      depends on the value you specify for the DEVICE attribute. See
I      "Default values for TYPETERM attributes" for details.
N
I      ALL: BMS routes to this terminal messages that are destined for
I        all terminals as well as those specifically destined for this
I        terminal.
N
I      NONE: BMS does not route any messages to this terminal, whether
I        they are destined for all terminals or for this terminal
I        specifically.
N
I      SPECIFIC: BMS routes messages to this terminal when they are
I        destined specifically for this terminal, but not when they are
I        destined for all terminals.
N
NDevice properties:
N------------------
D    ALTSCREEN(rows,columns)
I      Specifies the 3270 screen size to be used
I      for a transaction that has an alternate screen size specified in
I      its profile definition. The values that can be specified are:
N
I      Device Alternate Screen Size
I      ----------------------------
I      3276-1, 3278-1 (12,80)
I      3276-2, 3278-2 (24,80)
I      3276-3, 3278-3 (32,80)
I      3276-4, 3278-4 (43,80)
I      3278-5         (27,132)
I      3279-2A, 3279-2B (24,80)
I      3279-3A, 3279-3B (32,80)
N
I      No validity checking is performed on the screen size selected, and
I      incorrect sizes may lead to unpredictable results.
N
I      For BSC devices, both the alternate and default screen sizes are
I      determined by the device hardware. The alternate screen size is
I      the maximum screen size. For the 3290 display, both the default
I      and alternate screen sizes are determined by the customer setup
I      procedure.
N
I      For SNA devices (LUTYPE2 and LUTYPE3), you can specify any value
I      for both alternate and default screen sizes, up to the maximum
I      physical screen size. In particular, both the alternate and default
I      screen sizes can be the maximum screen size, or the default screen
I      size can be the maximum screen size with no alternate screen size
I      specified. The SNA bind is generated by CICS from this information.
I      You do not need to provide logmode table entries, or to customize
I      the device.
N
I      For non-SNA 3270 and LUTYPE2 devices, you can use the QUERY
I      structured field to determine the alternate screen size that has
I      been set up for the display. To use QUERY, leave the DEFSCREEN to
I      default to (24,80) and leave ALTSCREEN unspecified. The alternate
I      screen size is the size set up by the terminal user. Otherwise,
I      QUERY(COLD) or QUERY(ALL) has no effect on the alternate screen
I      size. Leaving ALTSCREEN unspecified without using QUERY under the
I      conditions described results in an alternate screen size of
I      (00,00).
N
I      If you use dual screen sizes, you can make a CICS transaction use
I      the alternate screen size by coding SCRNSIZE(ALTERNATE) in its
I      associated profile. If an application consists of several
I      pseudo-conversationally linked transactions, specify
I      SCRNSIZE(ALTERNATE) in the profile for each of these transactions
I      if the application uses the alternate screen size.
N
I      For 3287 and 3289 printers, the value specified must equal the
I      buffer size of the particular device. For non-SNA 3287 and 3289
I      printers, the sizes depend on the feature ordered, not on the
I      model number. For SNA printers, there are no features, and any
I      two sizes can be specified from the list of valid sizes. When
I      printing to a printer whose associated TERMINAL definition has
I      PRINTERCOPY(YES) specified, the ALTSCREEN value should match the
I      screen size of the terminal whose screen is to be printed. If the
I      values differ, unpredictable results may occur.
N
D    APLKYBD(NO | YES)
I      Specifies whether the 3270 device has the
I      APL keyboard feature:
N
I      YES: The 3270 device has the APL keyboard feature.
N
I      NO: The 3270 device does not have the APL keyboard feature.
N
D    APLTEXT(NO | YES)
I      Specifies whether the 3270 device has the
I      APL text feature:
N
I      YES: The 3270 device has the APL text feature.
N
I      NO: The 3270 device does not have the APL text feature.
N
I      Do not specify YES for a 3288 printer, with or without
I      TEXTPRINT(YES). The APLTEXT feature is used in conjunction with
I      the TEXTKYBD and APLKYBD operands.
N
I      You can use the QUERY structured field to determine whether the
I      device is set up to use the APL text feature.
N
D    AUDIBLEALARM(NO | YES)
I      Specifies whether the audible alarm feature
I      is installed for a 3270 display or for a 3270 printer attached to
I      a 3651 controller:
N
I     YES: The audible alarm feature is installed.
N
I      NO The audible alarm feature is not installed.
N
D    BACKTRANS(NO | YES)
I      Specifies whether the device has the background
I      transparency feature:
N
I      NO: The device does not have the background transparency feature.
N
I      YES: The device does have the background transparency feature.
N
I      You can use the QUERY structured field to determine whether the
I      device is set up to use the background transparency feature.
N
D    CGCSGID(0,0 | gcsid,cpgid)
I      The coded graphic character set global
I      identifier (CGCSGID) enables application programs to determine the
I      character set supported at the device.
N
I      You can get this information from a QUERY structured field for
I      some devices. For others, you must supply this information here,
I     so that application programs can retrieve it using the EXEC CICS ASSIGN com
N
I      0,0 No CGCSGID is specified.
N
I      gcsid,cpgid: The CGCSGID consists of two 5-digit decimal numbers
I        which can take values in the range 1 through 65535. gcsid is the
I        graphic character set global identifier (GCSGID) and cpgid is a
I        specification of the code points for the set, the code page
I        global identifier (CPGID).
N
D    COLOR(NO | YES)
I      Specifies whether the 3270 device or the SCS
I      printer has the extended color feature, which allows colors to be
I      selected for each field or character:
N
I      NO: The device does not have the extended color feature.
N
I      YES: The device has the extended color feature.
N
I      You can use the QUERY structured field to determine whether the
I      device is set up to use the color feature.
N
D    COPY(NO) | YES)
I      Specifies whether the copy feature for a 3270 display
I      or printer is included in the 3270 control unit:
N
I      NO: The copy feature is included.
N
I      YES: The copy feature is not included.
N
I      Leave it to default to COPY(NO) for 3270 compatibility mode
I      logical units, because COPY(YES) is ignored.
N
I      See also the PRINTERCOPY and ALTPRINTCOPY attributes of the
I      TERMINAL definition.
N
I      For further details about screen copying, see the CICS 3270 Data
I      Stream Device Guide.
N
D    DEFSCREEN(rows,columns)
I      Specifies the 3270 screen size or 3270
I      printer page size to be used on this device when attached to a
I      transaction or used by BMS for which the default screen size has
I      been specified in the profile definition. The default depends on
I      the value you specify for the DEVICE attribute (see "Default
I      values for TYPETERM attributes"). The values that can be
I      specified for a BSC 3270 are:
N
I      Device Screen size
I      ------------------------
I      3278-1         (12,40)

I      3278-5         (24,80)
I      3279-2A, 3279-2B (24,80)
I      3279-3A, 3279-3B (24,80)
N
I      For BSC devices, both default and alternate screen sizes are
I      determined by the terminal hardware. The default screen size is
I      (24,80), except for the 3278-1 where it is (12,40).
N
I      For SNA devices (LUTYPE2 and LUTYPE3), both default and alternate
I      screen sizes can be any value you choose, up to the maximum
I      physical screen size (see ALTSCREEN). In particular, both default
I      and alternate screen sizes can be the maximum screen size; or the
I      default screen size can be the maximum screen size with no
I      alternate screen size specified. The SNA bind is generated by
I      CICS from this TCT information. You do not need to provide
I      logmode table entries, or to customize the device.
N
D    DUALCASEKYBD(NO | YES)
I      Specifies whether a 3270 display has a
I      typewriter keyboard or an operator console keyboard. Both
I      uppercase and lowercase data can be transmitted with either of
I      these keyboards.
N
I      NO: The device does not have a dual-case keyboard.
N
I      YES: The device has a dual-case keyboard.
N
D    EXTENDEDDS(NO | YES)
I      Specifies whether the 3270 device or the SCS
I      printer supports extensions to the 3270 data stream:
N
I      NO: The device does not support 3270 data stream extensions.
N
I      YES: The device supports 3270 data stream extensions.
N
I      EXTENDEDDS(YES) is implied if you specify YES for any one of the
I      COLOR, HILIGHT, PROGSYMBOLS, QUERY, or VALIDATION (3270 only)
I      attributes.
N
I      If extended data stream (EXTENDEDDS) is set to YES, the device
I      will support the write structured field COMMAND and Outbound
I      Query structured field.
N
I      You can use the QUERY structured field to determine whether the
I      device is set up to use the extended data stream. Using the QUERY
I      structured field sets EXTENDEDDS to YES if query is valid.
N
D    FORMFEED(NO | YES)
I      Specifies whether or not the device has the
I      forms feed feature, which means that BMS uses the form-feed
I      character when formatting output documents:
N
I      NO: The device does not have the form feed feature.
N
I      YES The device has the form feed feature.
N
I      If DEVICE(SCSPRINT) is specified, BMS inserts a form-feed
I      character at the beginning of the data stream. This causes the
I      device to skip to the top margin of a new page before starting to
I      print.
N
I      The top margin is defined by a set vertical format (SVF) data
I      stream, and may be a line number equal to or greater than one. If
I      a SVF data stream has not been sent to the printer, the top margin
I      is line one. The line counter in the device is set to 1 when the
I      operator sets up the paper.
N
I      Note that the device may also perform an automatic form feed if
I      you try to print beyond a bottom margin. The bottom margin is
I      also determined by the SVF data stream and defaults to the maximum
I      presentation line (MPL). The MPL is the last line on the page and
I      its value represents the page or form length as a number of lines
I      (that is, physical page size times the line density). Both the MPL
I      and the line density can be determined by the SVF data stream.
I      Otherwise the MPL (the number of lines) can be set up on the
I      device by the operator.
N
I      If DEVICE(3270), DEVICE(3270P), DEVICE(LUTYPE2), or DEVICE(LUTYPE3)
I      is specified, use FORMFEED(YES) in conjunction with the FORMFEED
I      option in the BMS SEND commands. Using form feed on display
I      devices provides for a skip to a new page when the screen data is
I      copied to a printer.
N
I      The options discussed here for SCSPRINT operation do not apply
I      when the devices are operating as 3270P or LUTYPE3 devices. In
I      this case there is only the concept of a form length, and this
I      can be set on the device only by the operator.
N
D    HILIGHT(NO | YES)
I      Specifies whether the 3270 device or SCS printer
I      has the extended highlight facility, which enables fields or
I      characters to be displayed in reverse-video, underline mode, or
I      blink (3270 only):
N
I      NO: The device does not have the extended highlight facility.
N
I      YES: The device has the extended highlight facility.
N
I      You can use the QUERY structured field to determine whether the
I      device is set up to use the extended highlight facility.
N
D    HORIZFORM(NO | YES)
I      Specifies whether or not the device has the
I      horizontal form feature, which means that BMS should use the
I      horizontal tabbing when formatting output documents:
N
I      NO: The device does not have the horizontal form feature.
N
I      YES: The device has the horizontal form feature.
N
I      The devices that can use this feature are batch, batch data
I      interchange, interactive, SCSPRT or LUTYPE4 logical units.
N
I      NO: The HTAB option in the BMS map definition is ignored.
N
I      YES: BMS uses horizontal tabbing when formatting output documents.
N
D    KATAKANA(NO | YES)
I      Specifies whether Katakana support is required.
I      Katakana terminals cannot display mixed case output; uppercase
I      characters appear as uppercase English characters, but lowercase
I      characters appear as Katakana characters. If you have any Katakana
I      terminals connected to your CICS system, specify UPPER on the
I      MSGCASE system initialization parameter.
N
I      NO: Katakana support is not required.
N
I      YES: Katakana support is required. All lowercase characters sent
I        to the terminal from the following transactions are translated
I        to uppercase:
N
I      CBRC CDBC CDBI CEBR CECI CEDA CEDF CEMT CEOT CESN
I      CEST CMSG CRTE CSPG CWTO
N
I      Important: For emulated Katakana terminals, results depend on the
I      code page that is in use. In some cases, lowercase English
I      characters are not translated to uppercase.
N
D    LIGHTPEN(NO | YES)
I      Specifies whether a 3270 display has the
I      selector pen feature:
N
I      NO: The 3270 display does not have the selector pen feature.
N
I      YES: The 3270 display has the selector pen feature.
N
D    MSRCONTROL(NO | YES)
I      Specifies whether the terminal, an 8775 or
I      3643, has a magnetic slot reader. This option is not valid for
I      SCS printers.
N
I      You can use the QUERY structured field to determine whether the
I      device is set up to use a magnetic slot reader.
N
D    OBFORMAT(NO | YES)
I      Specifies whether outboard formatting is used.
I      If the devices for which you are defining this TYPETERM use BMS
I      outboard formatting, specify OBFORMAT(YES). OBFORMAT(YES) can be
I      specified for two device types only:
N
I      -> 3650, SESSIONTYPE(3270)
N
I      -> LUTYPE2, for an 8100 Information System using the DPPX operating
I         system with DPPX/DPS Version 2 for presentation services
N
I      Use the QUERY structured field to determine whether the device is
I      set up to use outboard formatting.
N
D    OUTLINE(NO | YES)
I      Specifies whether the device supports field
I      outlining:
N
I      NO: The device does not support field outlining.
N
I      YES: The device supports field outlining.
N
I      Use the QUERY structured field to determine whether the device is
I      set up to use field outlining.
N
D    PARTITIONS(NO | YES)
I      Specifies whether a device is to use
I      partitions. This option is not valid for SCS printers.
N
I      NO: The device is not to use partitions.
N
I      YES: The device is to use partitions.
N
I      You can use the QUERY structured field to determine whether the
I      device is set up to use partitions.
N
D    PRINTADAPTER(NO | YES)
I      For the 3275: specifies whether the printer
I      adapter feature and corresponding 3284 Printer Model 3 are present
I      on the 3275 Display Station. This feature makes the 3284 eligible
I      for print requests through the PA key from the host 3275.
N
I      NO: The printer adapter feature and corresponding 3284 Printer
I        Model 3 are not available.
N
I      YES: The printer adapter feature and corresponding 3284 Printer
I        Model 3 are available.
N
I      For LUTYPE2 logical units: specifies whether, for print requests
I      initiated by the PRINT key or by an ISSUE PRINT command, printer
I      allocation is handled by the 3790, or by the 3274 or 3276,
I      according to the printer authorization matrix for both
I      z/OS Communications Server and non-z/OS Communications Server
I      attachments.
N
I      NO: Print requests are not handled according to the printer
I        authorization matrix for both z/OS Communications Server and
I        non-z/OS Communications Server attachments.
N
I      YES: Print requests are handled according to the printer
I        authorization matrix for both z/OS Communications Server and
I        non-z/OS Communications Server attachments.
N
I      Further, 3270 printers attached to the same 3790 are available
I      for print requests sent to the 3270-display logical unit by a
I      terminal control print request or initiated by the operator. If
I      PRINTADAPTER is NO, printer allocation is determined by the
I      PRINTER and ALTPRINTER attributes of the TERMINAL definition.
N
I      If output is created on the screen by BMS requests with the PRINT
I      option, by BMS requests with the NLEOM option, or by the CMSG
I      command, the contents of the screen are automatically copied to
I      a 3270 printer, whether or not the CICS-defined PRINT key
I      (usually a PA key) was pressed.
N
D    PROGSYMBOLS(NO | YES)
I      Specifies whether the programmed symbol (PS)
I      facility can be used on this 3270 device or SCS printer. The
I      facility enables up to six 191-character sets, with
I      customer-defined and program-loaded fonts and codes, to be stored
I      and accessed.
N
I      NO: Programmed symbol (PS) facility cannot be used.
N
I      YES: Programmed symbol (PS) facility can be used.
N
I      You can use the QUERY structured field to determine whether the
I      device is set up to use programmed symbols.
N
D    QUERY(NO | ALL | COLD)
I      Specifies whether CICS should use the QUERY
I      structured field to determine the characteristics of the device.
N
I      NO: CICS does not use the QUERY function.
N
I      COLD: CICS uses the QUERY function to determine the characteristics
I        of the device only when the device is first connected after an
I        initial or a cold start of CICS. The device characteristics are
I        stored in the CICS global catalog for use on subsequent warm and
I        emergency starts.
N
I      ALL: CICS uses the QUERY function to determine the characteristics
I        of the device each time the device is connected.
N
D    SOSI(NO | YES)
I      Specifies whether the device supports mixed EBCDIC
I      and double-byte character set (DBCS) fields.
N
I      NO: The device does not support mixed EBCDIC and double-byte
I        character set (DBCS) fields.
N
I       YES: The device supports mixed EBCDIC and double-byte character
I        set (DBCS) fields.
N
I      You can use the QUERY structured field to determine whether the
I      device is set up to use mixed EBCDIC and DBCS fields.
N
D    TEXTKYBD(NO | YES)
I      Specifies whether the 3270 device has the
I      text-keyboard feature.
N
I      NO: The 3270 device does not have the text-keyboard feature.
N
I      YES: The 3270 device has the text-keyboard feature.
N
D    TEXTPRINT(NO | YES)
I      Specifies whether the 3288 printer has the
I      text-print feature.
N
I      NO: The 3288 printer doe not have the text-print feature.
N
I      YES: The 3288 printer has the text-print feature.
N
D    VALIDATION(NO | YES)
I      For the 8775, specifies whether the 8775 device
I      has the extended validation feature, which allows fields to be
I      defined as TRIGGER, MANDATORY FILL, or MANDATORY ENTER.
N
I      For the 3290, specifies whether the 3290 device has the validation
I      feature, which allows fields to be defined as MANDATORY FILL or
I      MANDATORY ENTER.
N
I      This option is not valid for SCS printers. If VALIDATION(YES) is
I      specified for an SCS printer, an error message is raised and the
I      option is ignored.
N
I      You can use the QUERY structured field to determine whether the
I      device is set up to use the validation feature.
N
D    VERTICALFORM(NO | YES)
I      Specifies whether the device has the vertical
I      form feature. The devices that can use this feature are batch,
I      batch data interchange, interactive, SCSPRT or LUTYPE4 logical
I      units.
N
I      NO: The device does not have the vertical form feature.
N
I      YES: The device has the vertical form feature.
N
N
NError display attributes:
N-------------------------
D    ERRCOLOR(NO | BLUE | GREEN | NEUTRAL | PINK | RED |
D      TURQUOISE | YELLOW)
I      Specifies whether the error message is to be
I      displayed in color. Coding ERRCOLOR(color) implies
I      ERRLASTLINE(YES).
N
I      The colors you can specify are:
N
I      BLUE
I      RED
I      PINK
I      GREEN
I      TURQUOISE
I      YELLOW
I      NEUTRAL
N
D    ERRHILIGHT(NO | BLINK | REVERSE | UNDERLINE)
I      Specifies the highlighting,
I      if any, with which error messages are to be displayed.
N
D    ERRINTENSIFY(NO | YES)
I      Specifies whether the error message is to
I      be displayed in an intensified field.
N
I      Coding ERRINTENSIFY(YES) implies ERRLASTLINE(YES).
N
D    ERRLASTLINE(NO | YES)
I      Specifies where error messages are to be
I      displayed.
N
I      NO: An error message is displayed at the current cursor position
I        and without any additional attributes.
N
I      YES: An error message is displayed starting at the beginning of
I        the line nearest the bottom of the screen so that the whole
I        message fits on the screen.
N
I       Because all error messages occupy the same line, if the messages
I       are received in quick succession, they overlay one another and
I       earlier messages may disappear before they have been read.
N
NRecovery-related attributes:
N----------------------------
D    RECOVNOTIFY(NONE | MESSAGE | TRANSACTION)
I      In a CICS region running
I      with persistent session support, this option specifies how a
I      terminal end user is notified that the terminal session has been
I      recovered; in a CICS region running with XRF support, it specifies
I      how the terminal user is notified that an XRF takeover has
I      occurred.
N
I      This option is not applicable to APPC sessions.
N
I      NONE: There is no notification that a terminal session has been
I        recovered, or that an XRF takeover has occurred.
N
I      MESSAGE: A message is displayed on the screen to say that the
I        system has recovered. The message is specified in two BMS maps
I        (DFHXRC1 and DFHXRC2) for XRF and in one BMS map (DFHXRC3) for
I        z/OS Communications Server persistent sessions. These maps are
I        in map set DFHXMSG. If reduced takeover time is important, use
I        MESSAGE rather than TRANSACTION.
N
I        The terminal must be defined with the ATI(YES) option, and must
I        be capable of displaying a BMS map.
N
I      TRANSACTION: A transaction is initiated at the terminal. The name
I        of the transaction is specified by the RMTRAN system
I        initialization parameter. For z/OS Communications Server
I        persistent sessions, only the first transaction named in the
I        RMTRAN system initialization parameter is used.
N
I        Tip: The default transaction for RMTRAN is the one specified in
I        the GMTRAN system initialization parameter: the good-morning
I        transaction. For the TRANSACTION option, the terminal must be
I        defined with the ATI(YES) option. If reduced takeover time is
I        important, use MESSAGE rather than TRANSACTION.
N
D    RECOVOPTION(SYSDEFAULT | CLEARCONV | NONE |
D      RELEASESESS | UNCONDREL)
I      This option applies to the recovery of sessions in a CICS
I      region running with z/OS Communications Server persistent
I      sessions, or with XRF.
N
I      In a CICS region running with persistent session support, this
I      option specifies how you want CICS to recover the session, and
I      return the terminal to service on system restart within the
I      persistent session delay interval.
N
I      For all recovery options other than NONE, if the action taken is a
I      z/OS Communications Server UNBIND, the UNBIND is followed by a
I      z/OS Communications Server SIMLOGON.
N
I      SYSDEFAULT is the default, but in some situations, if your
I      resource definition does not specify this attribute, CICS enforces
I      the NONE value for the attribute if this value is required for
I      compatibility with other options in your resource definition.
N
I      SYSDEFAULT: In a CICS region running with persistent sessions
I        support, this specifies that CICS is to select the optimum
I        procedure to recover a session on system restart within the
I        persistent session delay interval, depending on the session
I        activity and on the characteristics of the terminal.
N
I         Although sessions are recovered, any transactions in-flight at
I         the time of the failure are abended and not recovered.
I         Transactions are also abended if the recovered session is being
I         used by another CICS region over an APPC connection.
N
I         CICS recovers the session with the least possible impact, in
I         one of the following ways:
N
I         -> If the terminal was not executing a transaction at the time
I            of the CICS failure, no recovery action is required, and
I            CICS takes the appropriate recovery notification action as
I            defined by the RECOVNOTIFY attribute.
N
I         -> If the terminal was busy (that is, executing a transaction)
I            when CICS failed, CICS first tries to recover the session
I            by sending a z/OS Communications Server end-bracket
I            indicator. If the end-bracket does not recover the session
I            (for example, CICS may be in RECEIVE mode), CICS issues a
I            CLEAR command. If the terminal does not support the CLEAR
I            command, the recovery action taken is a z/OS Communications
I            Server UNBIND followed by a SIMLOGON. See Application design
I            considerations in Developing applications for more
I            information about persistent sessions.
N
I      CLEARCONV: Prevents CICS from sending an end-bracket indicator to
I        close an in-bracket session. Instead CICS sends a CLEAR request,
I        to reset the conversation states. If the session does not support
I        the CLEAR request, CICS sends an UNBIND request. The CLEAR or
I        UNBIND is sent only if the session was busy at the time of system
I        restart (in the case of persistent sessions) or takeover (in the
I        case of XRF).
N
I      RELEASESESS: Requires CICS to send an UNBIND request to release the
I        active session. The UNBIND is sent only if the session was busy
I        at the time of system restart (in the case of persistent
I        sessions), or takeover (in the case of XRF). Following the
I        UNBIND, the session is queued for SIMLOGON. If the session is
I        not busy, the requested recovery notification is carried out.
N
I      UNCONDREL: Requires CICS to send an UNBIND request to release the
I        active session. The UNBIND is sent whether or not the session was
I        busy at the time of system restart (in the case of persistent
I        sessions support) or the takeover (in the case of XRF). Following
I        the UNBIND, the session is queued for SIMLOGON.
N
I      NONE: In a CICS region running with persistent sessions support,
I        this specifies that the terminal session is not to be recovered
I        at system restart within the persistent session delay interval:
I        in effect, the terminal has no persistent sessions support.
I        LU6.2 sessions are unbound, but the latest negotiated CNOS value
I        is returned to the CICS system after the restart. After system
I        restart, the terminal is reconnected automatically if you specify
I        AUTOCONNECT(YES), subject to the operation of the AIRDELAY
I        system initialization parameter (AIRDELAY=0 overrides
I        AUTOCONNECT(YES), and the terminal is not reconnected).
N
I        Use RECOVOPTION(NONE) if this terminal or autoinstall model is to
I        be used with persistent sessions (PSDINT = nnn in the SIT) but
I        the terminal may be the subject of an
I        EXEC CICS ISSUE PASS LUNAME() LOGONLOGMODE.
