NOUTPUT JCL Statement
N====================
NPIMSG Parameter
N---------------
NUse the PIMSG parameter to indicate the handling of messages by
NPrint Services Facility (PSF). PIMSG is used to specify whether all
Nerror messages are to be printed, and the number of errors sufficient
Nto cause the printing process to be terminated and the data set to
Nbe purged.
N
D//outds OUTPUT PIMSG=({YES | Y | NO | N},count)
I                 YES: Requests the system to print all messages
I                   generated by PSF.
I                   You can also code this subparameter as Y.
I
I                   When you code PIMSG=YES, the system prints all these
I                   messages at the end of the output data set.
I
I                 NO: Requests that the system print no error messages,
I                   unless printing of the data set is prematurely
I                   terminated. If a terminating error occurs, only
I                   the set of messages (called a message group)
I                   associated with the error that caused the
I                   termination is printed.
I                   You can also code this subparameter as N.
I
I                   When you code PIMSG=NO, no messages are printed
I                   unless there is an error that forces premature
I                   termination of the printing of the data set. If an
I                   error occurs, the system prints the set of messages
I                   (called a message group) associated with the error
I                   that caused the termination.
I
I                 msg-count: Requests the system to cancel the printing
I                   of the current data set after the specified number
I                   of errors (as represented by the associated message
I                   groups) have been detected by PSF or reported to PSF
I                   by the printer. In this context, errors refers to
I                   data-stream errors, and errors resulting from any
I                   malfunction that would cause the printer to halt,
I                   such as a mechanism failure, or out-of-paper
I                   condition. However, these errors do not include
I                   those caused by operator intervention.
I
I                   Valid values for msg-count are 0-999, where 0 is
I                   interpreted as infinite.
