I      must have access to RACF FACILITY class profile
I      STGADMIN.IGG.LIBRARY.

I        1-to-6 character volume serial number. The volume serial number
I        can include only uppercase alphabetics A-Z and numerics 0-9.

N
D      RECORDING( /* Abbreviation: REC */ -
D       18TRACK | 36TRACK | 128TRACK | 256TRACK | 384TRACK | -
D       EFMT1 | EFMT2 | EFMT3 | EEFMT3 | UNKNOWN -
D      ) -

I        volumes default to 36TRACK for MEDIA1 and MEDIA2. Scratch tape
I        volumes default to 128TRACK for MEDIA3 and MEDIA4.
N
I        18TRACK: Tape was written and must be read on an 18-track

I          The default is blanks.
N
D      SPECIALATTRIBUTE( /* Abbreviation: SATTR */ -
D       READCOMPATIBLE | NONE -
D      ) -
I        shows special attributes of the tape volume. Use this only for
I        private tape volumes. Scratch tape volumes default to NONE.
N

N
I          However, if the USEATTRIBUTE=SCRATCH then the storage group
I          name defaults to *SCRTCH*.
N
D      USEATTRIBUTE( /* Abbreviation: UATTR */ -
D       SCRATCH | PRIVATE -
D      ) -
I        can be SCRATCH for scratch volumes or PRIVATE for private
I        volumes. If you use SCRATCH, the storage group name is set to

N
D      WRITEDATE(wrtdate) /* Abbreviation: WDATE */ -
I        identifies the date that a data set on a tape volume was last
I        opened for writing.
N
I        wrtdate: is a date, YYYY-MM-DD. Search "Tape Library Date
I          Formats" for a description of valid date values.

N
D      WRITEPROTECT | NOWRITEPROTECT /* Abbreviations: WPRT and NWPRT */
I        identifies whether the tape volume is write protected or not.
I        If you do not use this, write protect status is unknown.
N
I        WRITEPROTECT: indicates that the tape volume is write
I          protected.
N
I          Setting WRITEPROTECT in the tape volume entry does not
I          automatically write protect your volume. It is an
I          informational setting that is recorded when software detects
I          that the volume is write protected and is not used by
I          software when determining whether the volume is protected.
I          For a volume to be write protected, you will still need to
I          set the write protect tab available on the physical tape
I          volume. Since the availability to write protect a volume
I          does not exist for logical volumes in a VTS, (no tab
I          available either physically or logically), you can
I          alternately use RACF or PROTECT=ALL in your JCL to protect
I          the volume during usage.
N
I        NOWRITEPROTECT: indicates that the tape volume is not write
I          protected.
