NChapter 39. IEFBR14 -Do (almost) nothing
N----------------------------------------
NInfluencing STEP level execution in a job can be done by
Nrunning a program that sets register 15 to the desired
Nvalue.
N
NIBM provides IEFBR14 as a program that does nothing more
Nthan set register 15 to 0.
N
NSearch the Web and you should find ways to set register 15
Nfor things like day-of-week, system executing on, and
Nwhatever else someone dreamed up. I have used REXX to set
Nregister 15 based on whether a DB2 subsystem was active or not.
