NChapter 31. TRANCLASS resources
N-------------------------------
NA TRANCLASS resource defines the characteristics of a transaction
Nclass.
N
NTransactions that are defined as belonging to a transaction class are
Nsubject to scheduling constraints before they are allowed to execute.
NIf transactions belonging to an active transaction class are already
Nrunning, any new transactions are queued. Use the MAXACTIVE attribute
Nto specify the maximum number of transactions that you want to run. To
Nlimit the size of the queue, you can use the PURGETHRESH attribute.
N
NBy putting your transactions into transaction classes, you can control
Nhow CICS dispatches tasks. For example, you can separate transactions
Ninto those that are heavy resource users and those that are of lesser
Nimportance, such as the Good morning" broadcast messages. You can then
Nuse the attributes on the TRANCLASS definition to control the number of
Nactive tasks allowed from each transaction class.
