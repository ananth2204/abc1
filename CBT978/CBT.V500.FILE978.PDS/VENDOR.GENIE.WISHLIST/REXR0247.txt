NChapter 2. REXX general concepts
N--------------------------------
N  Commands to external environments
N  ---------------------------------
N    Host commands and host command environments
N    -------------------------------------------
N      The CPICOMM, LU62, and APPCMVS host command environments
N      --------------------------------------------------------
NThe CPICOMM, LU62, and APPCMVS host command environments are available
Nto REXX execs that run in any MVS address space. The CPICOMM
Nenvironment lets you use the SAA common programming interface (CPI)
NCommunications calls. The LU62 environment lets you use the APPC/MVS
Ncalls that are based on the SNA LU 6.2 architecture. The APPCMVS
Nenvironment allows APPC transaction programs to invoke APPC/MVS
Nserver facilities callable services and callable services related to
Nthe testing of transaction programs (TPs). Using these environments,
Nyou can write APPC/MVS transaction programs (TPs) in the REXX
Nprogramming language. Using CPICOMM, you can write transaction
Nprograms (TPs) in REXX that can be used in different SAA environments.
M
MThese environments are far too complex to cover under the REXX
MReference TOPIC. Find the z/OS MVS Programming: Writing Transaction
MPrograms for APPC/MVS manual if you want additional information.
