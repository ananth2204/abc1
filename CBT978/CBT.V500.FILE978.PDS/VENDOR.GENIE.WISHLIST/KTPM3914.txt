Nafter its last use.
N-------------------------------------------------------------
M With the advent of System Managed Storage as a discipline in the
M 1980's there came better and safer ways of managing datasets. Since
M there is no good reason to use IEFBR14 to allocate a dataset with a
M DISP=(MOD,DELETE) just to delete it if it did exist, you should go
M look at the AMSU members for the better way.
N
N Stop complaining about slow performance if you are using this method.
N You are forcing the system to do I/O on a disk volume to allocate a
N dataset and then turn around and do I/O to delete the dataset.
N That is not efficient.
N
N See the AMSU members for a cleaner way to delete a data set.
