NChapter 2. Description of the ISPF services
N-------------------------------------------
NFILESTAT-Statistics for a file
N------------------------------
NUse the FILESTAT service to determine statistics about a file on the
Nconnected workstation. FILESTAT returns information that the file
Nexists, the longest length record in the file, and the date and time
Non the file.
N
NNote: Be aware that when the FILESTAT service is issued for certain
Nreserved or restricted operating system file names, your workstation
Noperating system or host system can cease to function, or "hang". See
Myour workstation operating system documentation to note reserved or
Nrestricted file names.
N
NCommand invocation format
N-------------------------
D  ADDRESS ISPEXEC "FILESTAT" ,
D    "FILE(var-name)" ,
I      The variable name containing the workstation file for which you
I      want statistics. If no parameters other than the file name are
I      specified, the function will verify that the file exists with a
I      return code of 0.
N
D    "LRECL(var-name)" ,
I      The variable name in which ISPF returns the longest record length
I      of the file you specify. The variable is returned in character
I      format and has a length of 8.
N
D    "DATE(var-name)"
I      The variable name in which ISPF returns the date and time that
I      the specified workstation file was last changed. The date and
I      time are returned in character format, and have a length of 19.
I      The date format is 'yyyy/mm/dd hh:mm:ss'.
N
NReturn codes
N------------
NThese return codes are possible:
N
D  filestat_rc = RC
D  SELECT
D    WHEN (filestat_rc = 0) THEN DO
D      /* Workstation file exists. */
D      NOP
D    END
D    WHEN (filestat_rc = 4) THEN DO
D      /* Workstation file does not exist. */
D      SAY "Ask your programmer to handle this condition using SETMSG."
D      SAY ZERRSM
D      SAY ZERRLM
D    END
D    WHEN (filestat_rc = 8) THEN DO
D      /* Error in variable specification. */
D      SAY "Ask your programmer to fix the variable specification."
D      SAY ZERRSM
D      SAY ZERRLM
D    END
D    WHEN (filestat_rc = 10) THEN DO
D      /* No workstation connection exists. */
D      SAY "Ask your programmer to handle this condition using SETMSG."
D      SAY ZERRSM
D      SAY ZERRLM
D    END
D    WHEN (filestat_rc = 12) THEN DO
D      /* Workstation device is not ready. */
D      SAY "Ask the use to ready the workstation using SETMSG."
D      SAY ZERRSM
D      SAY ZERRLM
D    END
D    WHEN (filestat_rc = 20) THEN DO
D      /* Severe error in FILESTAT service. */
D      SAY "Ask your programmer to fix error."
D      SAY ZERRSM
D      SAY ZERRLM
D    END
D    OTHERWISE DO
D      SAY "Something very unexpected happened, RC("filestat_rc")."
D    END
D  END

NExample 1: Verifies the existence of a file on the workstation.
N---------------------------------------------------------------
I  ADDRESS ISPEXEC "CONTROL ERRORS RETURN"
I  fvar = 'd:\design\langsel.des'
I  ADDRESS ISPEXEC "FILESTAT" ,
I    "FILE(fvar) LRECL(lvar) DATE(dvar)"
I  SAY "Workstation file:" fvar
I  SAY "Last changed:" dvar "Max LRECL:" lvar
