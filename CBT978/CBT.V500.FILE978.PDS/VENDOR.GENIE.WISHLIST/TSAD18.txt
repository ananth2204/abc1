NChapter 18: Problem Documentation Upload Utility
N------------------------------------------------
NThe IBM z/OS Problem Documentation Upload Utility (PDUU) is a utility
Nthat sends large amounts of documentation in a more efficient manner
Nthan using File Transfer Protocol (FTP) to send one large data set to
NIBM FTP sites. This utility sections the input file data set (such as
Nstand-alone dump data set) into smaller data sets that are compressed
Nand sent in parallel using multiple, simultaneous FTP sessions. This
Nresults in shorter transmission time for very large data sets. You can
Nalso encrypt the data sets.
