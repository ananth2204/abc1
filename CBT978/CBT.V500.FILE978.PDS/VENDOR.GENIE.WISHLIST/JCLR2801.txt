NJES3 Control Statement
N======================
NJECL //**command Statement
N--------------------------
NUse the command statement to enter a JES3 operator command through the
Ninput stream.
N
NJES3 usually executes an in-stream command as soon as it is read.
NTherefore, the command will not be synchronized with the execution of
Nany job or step in the input stream. To synchronize a command with job
Nprocessing, tell the operator the commands you want and when they
Nshould be issued, then let the operator enter them from the console.
M
MShould you really be entering JES commands this way? If you are
Mauthorized to issue commands this way, they execute as they are
Mprocessed, not when your job starts.
N
