NExample 6: Edit and Copy a Sequential Input Data Set with Labels
N----------------------------------------------------------------
NIn this example, a sequential input data set is edited and copied.

NThe control statements are discussed below:
N
N  SYSUT1 DD defines the sequential input data set (OLDSET). The data
N  set was originally written as the third data set on a tape volume.
N
N  SYSUT2 DD defines the sequential output data set (NEWSET). The data
N  set is written as the first data set on a tape volume. The output
N  records are blocked to reduce the space required by the data set and
N  to reduce the access time required when the data set is subsequently
N  referred to. The BLKSIZE parameter is omitted so that the system will
N  calculate an optimal value that is less than or equal to 32,760 bytes
N  unless the system programmer sets the default differently.
N
N  SYSIN DD defines the control data set, which follows in the input
N  stream.
N
N  GENERATE indicates that a maximum of three FIELD parameters is
N  included in subsequent RECORD statements and that a maximum of 11
N  literal characters are included in subsequent FIELD parameters.
N
N  The first RECORD statement controls the editing, as follows:
N  asterisks are placed in positions 1 through 10; positions 1 through
N  5 of the input record are converted from H-set BCDIC to EBCDIC mode
N  and moved to positions 11 through 15; and an equal sign is placed in
N  position 16.
N
N  The second RECORD statement indicates that the next two records from
N  SYSIN should be written out as user header labels on SYSUT2.
N
N  The third RECORD statement indicates that the next two records from
N  SYSIN should be written as user trailer labels on SYSUT2.
* End of WISH.
