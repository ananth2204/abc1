N=============
NTYPRUN Parameter
N----------------
NUse the TYPRUN parameter to request special job processing. The TYPRUN
Nparameter can tell the system to:
N
N->In a JES2 system, copy the input job stream directly to a sysout data
N  set and schedule it for output processing.
N
N->In a JES2 or JES3 system, place a job on hold until a special event
N  occurs. When the event occurs, the operator, following your
N  directions, must release the job from its hold to allow the system to
N  select the job for processing. Use the JES2 /*MESSAGE statement or
N  the JES3 //*OPERATOR statement to notify the operator to release
N  the job.
N
N->In a JES2 or JES3 system, scan a job's JCL for syntax errors.

I                 COPY:    Requests that JES2 copy the input job stream,
I                          as submitted, directly to a sysout data set
I                          and schedule the sysout data set for output
I                          processing. The system does not schedule the
I                          job for execution. The class of this sysout
I                          data set is the same as the message class of
I                          the job and is controlled by the JOB MSGCLASS
I                          parameter.
I                 HOLD:    Requests that the system hold the job before
I                          execution until the operator releases it. The
I                          operator should release the job when a
I                          particular event occurs. If an error occurs
I                          during input service processing, JES does not
I                          hold the job.
I                 JCLHOLD: Requests that JES2 hold the job before
I                          completing JCL processing. JES2 holds the job
I                          until the operator releases it.
M                          This might let you promote a PROC before you
M                          release the JOB.
I                 SCAN:    Requests that the system scan this job's JCL
I                          for syntax errors, without executing the job
I                          or allocating devices.
