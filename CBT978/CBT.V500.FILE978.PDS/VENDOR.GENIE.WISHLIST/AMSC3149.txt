NCase 19: Dual Copy Device Address Mapping
N-----------------------------------------
NIn a dual copy environment, normal subsystem activities can modify the
Ninternal mapping of the system address (device number) to the actual
Ndevice. In IDCAMS reports and in the output of the DEVSERV command,
Nthe low-order two digits of the system address are shown as the CCA,
Nwhereas the physical device address is shown as the DDC. The subsystem
Nmanages the integrity of this mapping, so it need not be a cause for
Nconcern. Circumstances exist, however, when the user needs to be aware
Nthat dual copy address mapping may have changed:
N
N-> When device maintenance is required
N
N-> When devices are being removed or repositioned
N
N-> When subsystem re-initialization is required
N
N-> When it is necessary to vary a device offline for reconfiguration
N   or maintenance, use the CCA to determine the system address.
N
NYou can see the current map of system and device addresses by issuing
Nthe DEVSERV command or by running IDCAMS LISTDATA DSTATUS to any device
Nor volume in the subsystem. Along with EREP (for 3380s) and SIM
Nmessages (for 3390s), this information may be useful to the service
Nrepresentative for identifying a failing device.
N
NNote: Because of the asynchronous nature of IDCAMS operations, it is
Npossible that during certain operations, the results from a DEVSERV
Ncommand could differ from the results of an IDCAMS report. If the two
Noperations start together, the DEVSERV results are more current.
