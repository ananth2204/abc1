NExample 4: Update a Library Member
N----------------------------------
NIn this example, a member (MODMEMB) is updated within the space it
Nactually occupies. Two existing logical records are replaced, and the
Nentire member is renumbered.
N
D//UPDATE   JOB ...
D//ST01#01 EXEC PGM=IEBUPDTE,PARM=MOD
D//SYSPRINT  DD SYSOUT=*
D//SYSUT1    DD DISP=(OLD),DSN=PDS
D//*                                          <==== SHIFT THE DATA LEFT
D//SYSIN     DD *
D  ./       CHANGE NAME=MODMEMB,LIST=ALL,UPDATE=INPLACE
D  ./       NUMBER SEQ1=ALL,NEW1=10,INCR=5
D
D  (Data statement 1, sequence number 00000020)
D  (Data statement 2, sequence number 00000035)

N
NThe control statements are discussed below:
N
N  SYSUT1 DD defines the partitioned data set that is updated in place.
I  (Note that the member name need not be specified in the DD
I  statement.)
M  Need not be specified OR cannot be?
N
N  SYSIN DD defines the control data set, which follows in the input
N  stream.
N
N  The CHANGE function statement indicates the name of the member to be
N  updated (MODMEMB) and specifies the UPDATE=INPLACE operation. The
N  entire member is listed in the message data set. Note that, as
N  renumbering is being done, and since UPDATE=INPLACE was specified,
N  the listing would have been provided even if the LIST=ALL parameter
N  had not been specified. See the LIST parameter for more information.
N
N  The NUMBER detail statement indicates that the entire member is to
N  be renumbered, and specifies the first sequence number to be assigned
N  and the increment value (5) for successive sequence numbers.
N
N  The data statements replace existing logical records having sequence
N  numbers of 20 and 35.
