NChapter 2. Description of the ISPF services
N-------------------------------------------
NBROWSE-Browse a data set
N------------------------
NThe BROWSE service provides an interface to the Browse function and
Nbypasses the display of the View Entry Panel. For a complete
Ndescription of the Browse function see SC19-3627-30 (f54ug00.pdf)
Nz/OS ISPF User's Guide Volume II.
N
NThe BROWSE service allows you to use a customized panel for displaying
Ndata. Panel ISRBROB should be used as a model for your customized
Npanel. You can also use the BROWSE service recursively, either through
Nnested dialogs or by entering a BROWSE command while browsing. BROWSE
Nallows you to browse up to a maximum of 99,999,999 records.
N
NBROWSE can be used to look at any ISPF library, concatenation of ISPF
Nlibraries, or data set that can be allocated by using the LMINIT
Nservice. However, it cannot be used by a PL/I main program that also
Nuses subtasking. The BRIF service allows you to browse data types not
Nsupported by ISPF.
N
NCommand invocation format
N-------------------------
D  ADDRESS ISPEXEC "CONTROL ERRORS RETURN"
D  ADDRESS ISPEXEC "BROWSE" ,
D    "DATASET("dsname")" ,
I      The data set name, in TSO syntax, of the data set to be browsed.
I      This is equivalent to the "other" data set name on the View Entry
I      Panel. You can specify a fully qualified data set name enclosed
I      in apostrophes. If the apostrophes are omitted, the TSO data set
I      prefix from the user's TSO profile is automatically attached to
I      the data set name. The maximum length of this parameter is
I      56 characters.
N
I      For ISPF libraries and MVS partitioned data sets, you can specify
I      a member name or pattern enclosed in parentheses. If a member
I      name is not included, or a pattern is specified as part of the
I      dsname specification when the DATASET keyword is used, a member
I      selection list for the ISPF library, concatenation of libraries,
I      or MVS partitioned data set is displayed. See the topic on naming
I      ISPF libraries and data sets in SC19-3627-30 (bf54ug00_v2r3.pdf)
I      ISPF User's Guide Volume I for a complete description of patterns
I      and pattern matching.
N
I      Note: You can also specify a VSAM data set name. If a VSAM data
I      set is specified, ISPF checks the ISPF configuration table to
I      see if VSAM support is enabled. If it is, the specified tool is
I      invoked. If VSAM support is not enabled, an error message is
I      displayed.
N
M      IBM FileManager for z/OS supports VSAM data sets.
N
D    "VOLUME("serial")" /* Not needed for catalogued data sets */ ,
I      The serial number of the volume on which the data set resides. If
I      you omit this parameter or code it as blank, the system catalog
I      is searched for the data set name.
M      The system catalog is your friend!
I      The maximum length of this parameter is 6 characters.
N
N    "PASSWORD("pswd-value")" ,
N      /* Obsolete if you have CA-ACF2, RACF, CA-Top-Secret. */ ,
I      The password if the data set has MVS password protection. Do not
I      specify a password for data sets that are protected by Resource
I      Access Control Facility (RACF), CA-ACF2, OR CA-Top-Secret.
N
D    "PANEL("panel-name")" ,
I      The name of a customized browse panel that you create, to be used
I      when displaying the data. See GC19-3623-30 (f54pc00_v2r3.pdf)
I      z/OS ISPF Planning and Customizing for information about
I      developing a customized panel.
N
M      SC19-3619-00 (isp2dg00.pdf) Dialog Developer's Guide and
M      Reference will provide the details about coding a panel.
N
D    "FORMAT("format-name")" ,
I      The name of the format to be used to reformat the data. The
I      format-name parameter is provided to support the IBM 5550
I      terminal using the Double-Byte Character Set (DBCS).
N
D    "MIXED(NO | YES)"
I      For the MIXED parameter, if YES is specified, the BROWSE service
I      treats the data as mixed-mode DBCS data. If NO is specified, the
I      data is treated as EBCDIC (single-byte) data. This parameter is
I      provided to support the IBM 5550 terminal using the Double-Byte
I      Character Set (DBCS).
N
N  or
N
D  ADDRESS ISPEXEC "BROWSE" ,
D    "DATAID("data-id")" ,
I      The data ID that was returned from the LMINIT service. The
I      maximum length of this parameter is 8 characters.
N
I      You can use the LMINIT service in either of two ways before
I      invoking the BROWSE service:
N
I      ->  You can use LMINIT to allocate existing data sets by
I          specifying a data set name or ISPF library qualifiers.
I          LMINIT returns a data ID as output. This data ID, rather
I          than a data set name, is then passed as input to the BROWSE
I          service.
N
I      -> The dialog can allocate its own data set by using the
I         TSO ALLOCATE command or MVS dynamic allocation, and then pass
I         the ddname to LMINIT. Again, a data ID is returned as output
I         from LMINIT and subsequently passed to the BROWSE service.
I         This procedure is called the ddname interface to BROWSE. It is
I         particularly useful for browsing VIO data sets, which cannot
I         be accessed by data set name because they are not cataloged.
N
I      Note: Using the data ID of a multivolume data set causes Browse
I      to look at all volumes of that data set. If you want to look at
I      just one volume of a multivolume data set, use the data set name
I      and volume number.
N
D    "MEMBER("member-name")" ,
I      A member of an ISPF library or MVS partitioned data set, or a
I      pattern. If you do not specify a member name when the MEMBER
I      keyword or call invocation is used, or if a pattern is specified,
I      a member selection list for the ISPF library, concatenation of
I      libraries, or MVS partitioned data set is displayed.
N
D    "PANEL("panel-name")" ,
I      The name of a customized browse panel that you create, to be used
I      when displaying the data. See GC19-3623-30 (f54pc00_v2r3.pdf)
I      z/OS ISPF Planning and Customizing for information about
I      developing a customized panel.
N
M      SC19-3619-00 (isp2dg00.pdf) Dialog Developer's Guide and
M      Reference will provide the details about coding a panel.
N
D    "FORMAT("format-name")" ,
I      The name of the format to be used to reformat the data. The
I      format-name parameter is provided to support the IBM 5550
I      terminal using the Double-Byte Character Set (DBCS).
N
D    "MIXED(NO | YES)"
I      For the MIXED parameter, if YES is specified, the BROWSE service
I      treats the data as mixed-mode DBCS data. If NO is specified, the
I      data is treated as EBCDIC (single-byte) data. This parameter is
I      provided to support the IBM 5550 terminal using the Double-Byte
I      Character Set (DBCS).
N
N  or
N
D  ADDRESS ISPEXEC "BROWSE" ,
D    "FILE(filevar)" ,
I      The name of an ISPF variable containing the path name for a
I      z/OS UNIX regular file or directory. If the path name is for a
I      directory, a directory selection list is displayed.
N
D    "PANEL("panel-name")" ,
I      The name of a customized browse panel that you create, to be used
I      when displaying the data. See GC19-3623-30 (f54pc00_v2r3.pdf)
I      z/OS ISPF Planning and Customizing for information about
I      developing a customized panel.
N
M      SC19-3619-00 (isp2dg00.pdf) Dialog Developer's Guide and
M      Reference will provide the details about coding a panel.
N
D    "FORMAT("format-name")" ,
I      The name of the format to be used to reformat the data. The
I      format-name parameter is provided to support the IBM 5550
I      terminal using the Double-Byte Character Set (DBCS).
N
D    "MIXED(NO | YES)"
I      For the MIXED parameter, if YES is specified, the BROWSE service
I      treats the data as mixed-mode DBCS data. If NO is specified, the
I      data is treated as EBCDIC (single-byte) data. This parameter is
I      provided to support the IBM 5550 terminal using the Double-Byte
I      Character Set (DBCS).
N
D    "RECLEN("rec-len")"
I      A numeric value specifying the record length to be used when
I      browsing a z/OS UNIX file. This parameter causes newline
I      characters in the data to be ignored as record delimiters.
N

D      /* A VSAM data set was specified but the ISPF Configuration
D         Table does not allow VSAM processing. */
