NChapter 1. Using Access Method Services
N---------------------------------------
NInvoking Access Method Services
N-------------------------------
NWhen you want to use an access method services function, enter a
Ncommand and specify its parameters. Your request is decoded one
Ncommand at a time; the appropriate functional routines perform all
Nservices required by that command.
N
NYou can call the access method services program:
N
N-> As a job or jobstep
N
N-> From a TSO/E session
N
N-> From within your own program
N
NYou can run the IDCAMS program (the access method services operating
Nsystem) and include the command and its parameters as input to the
Nprogram. You can also call the IDCAMS program from within another
Nprogram and pass the command and its parameters to the IDCAMS program.
N
NTime sharing option (TSO/E) users can run access method services
Nfunctional commands from a TSO/E session as though they were
NTSO/E commands.
N
NSee Appendix D, "Invoking Access Method Services from Your Program"
Nfor more information.
N
NUsing a Job or Jobstep to invoke Access Method Services
N-------------------------------------------------------
NYou can use (JCL) statements to call access method services.
NPGM=IDCAMS identifies the access method services program. For example:
N
D//YOURJOB  JOB YOUR INSTALLATION'S JOB=ACCOUNTING DATA
D//STEP1   EXEC PGM=IDCAMS
D//SYSPRINT  DD SYSOUT=*
D//SYSIN     DD *
D  access method services commands and their parameters

N
NFrom a Time Sharing Option Session
N----------------------------------
NYou can use the time sharing option (TSO/E) with VSAM and access
Nmethod services to:
N
N-> Run access method services functional commands
N
N-> Run a program to call access method services
N
NEach time you enter an access method services command as a TSO/E
Ncommand, TSO/E builds the appropriate interface information and
Ncalls access method services.
N
NYou can enter one command at a time. Access method services processes
Nthe command completely before TSO/E lets you continue processing.
NExcept for ALLOCATE, all the access method services functional
Ncommands are supported in a TSO/E environment.
