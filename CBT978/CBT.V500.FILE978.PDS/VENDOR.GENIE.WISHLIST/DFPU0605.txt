NChapter 6. IEBGENER (Sequential Copy/Generate Data Set) Program
N---------------------------------------------------------------
NExample 5: Produce Blocked Copy on Tape from Unblocked Disk File
N----------------------------------------------------------------
NIn this example, a blocked copy on tape is made from an unblocked
Nsequential disk file. Because the disk data set has a relatively small
Nblock size, the number of buffers explicitly requested is larger than
Nthe default of five. This improves performance by permitting more
Noverlap of reading the SYSUT1 data set with writing the SYSUT2 data
Nset.

D//COPYJOB  JOB ...
D//ST01#01 EXEC PGM=IEBGENER,REGION=318K
D//SYSPRINT  DD SYSOUT=*
D//SYSIN     DD DUMMY
D//SYSUT1    DD DISP=(OLD),DSN=INPUT,
D//             DCB=(BUFNO=20)
D//SYSUT2    DD DISP=(NEW,CATLG),DSN=OUTPUT,
D//             UNIT=tape,
D//             DCB=(RECFM=FB,BLKSIZE=32000,LRECL=2000)

NThe job control statements are discussed below:
N
N  The EXEC statement names the IEBGENER program and specifies the
N  virtual storage region size required. (Calculation of region size is
N  described in Table 15 on page 79.)
N
N  The SYSIN DD statement is a dummy, since no editing is to be
N  performed.
N
N  The SYSUT1 DD statement identifies an input disk file. Normally, the
N  DCB information should not be specified in the DD statement for an
N  existing disk file because the information exists in the data set
N  label in the VTOC; it is specified in this example to illustrate the
N  use of the BUFNO sub-parameter. The DCB information specifies
N  BUFNO=20 to allow up to twenty blocks to be read with each rotation
N  of the disk, assuming the disk track will hold that many blocks.
N
N  The SYSUT2 DD statement identifies the output tape data set and
N  specifies a block size of 32,000 bytes. The default of five buffers
N  should be enough to keep pace with the input.
