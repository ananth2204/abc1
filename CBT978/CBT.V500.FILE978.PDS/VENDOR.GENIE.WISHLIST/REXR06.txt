N=========================
NChapter 6. Numbers and arithmetic
N---------------------------------
NREXX defines the usual arithmetic operations (addition, subtraction,
Nmultiplication, and division) in as natural a way as possible. What
Nthis really means is that the rules followed are those that are
Nconventionally taught in schools and colleges.
N
NDuring the design of these facilities, however, it was found that
Nunfortunately the rules vary considerably (indeed much more than
Ngenerally appreciated) from person to person and from application to
Napplication and in ways that are not always predictable. The arithmetic
Ndescribed here is, therefore, a compromise that (although not the
Nsimplest) should provide acceptable results in most applications.

MMessage from Kenneth Tomiak
MThe author protests too much. The correct use of parenthesis will
Mserve to make it predictable how arithemetic operations are handled.
MThe normal arithemetic needs will be met just fine.
