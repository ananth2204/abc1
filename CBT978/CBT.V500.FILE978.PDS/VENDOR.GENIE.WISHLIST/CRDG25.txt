NChapter 25. PROFILE resources
N-----------------------------
NA PROFILE resource specifies options that control the interactions
Nbetween transactions and terminals or logical units. The PROFILE is
Na means of standardizing the use of such options as screen size and
Nprinter compatibility, and the use of such functions as message
Njournaling and the node error program.
N
NMODENAME
N--------
NA profile is associated with the communication between a transaction
Nand an LUTYPE6.1 or APPC session to another system. For APPC sessions,
Nyou refer on the PROFILE definition to the MODENAME that is also named
Non the SESSIONS definitions. This MODENAME is the name of the mode set
Nto which the sessions belong. See Chapter 7, "CONNECTION resources".
N
NWhen installed in CICS, the information from the PROFILE definition
Ncreates an entry in the profile table. This entry is later used by each
Ntransaction that references that PROFILE.
N
NThere are CICS-supplied PROFILE definitions suitable for most purposes.
NEach TRANSACTION definition names the PROFILE to be used. If you do not
Nspecify a PROFILE, the transaction uses the PROFILE supplied for using
Na terminal in a standard way.
