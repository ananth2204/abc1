NChapter 6. Numbers and arithmetic
N---------------------------------
NDefinition
N----------
NNumbers used directly by REXX
N-----------------------------
NAs discussed, the result of any arithmetic operation is rounded (if
Nnecessary) according to the setting of NUMERIC DIGITS. Similarly, when
NREXX directly uses a number (which has not necessarily been involved
Nin an arithmetic operation), the same rounding is also applied. It is
Njust as though the number had been added to 0.
N
NIn the following cases, the number used must be a whole number, and
Nan implementation restriction on the largest number that can be used
Nmay apply:
N
N-> The positional patterns in parsing templates (including variable
N   positional patterns)
N-> The power value (right hand operand) of the power operator
N-> The values of exprr and exprf in the DO instruction
N-> The values given for DIGITS or FUZZ in the NUMERIC instruction
N-> Any number used in the numeric option in the TRACE instruction
* End of WISH.
