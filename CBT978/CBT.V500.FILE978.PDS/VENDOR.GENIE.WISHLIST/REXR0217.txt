N=========================
NChapter 2. REXX general concepts
N--------------------------------
N  Parentheses and operator precedence
N  -----------------------------------
NExpression evaluation is from left to right; parentheses and operator
Nprecedence modify this:
N
N-> When parentheses are encountered (other than those that identify
N   function calls) the entire subexpression between the parentheses
N   is evaluated immediately when the term is required.
N
N-> When the sequence:
N     term1 operator1 term2 operator2 term3
N   is encountered, and operator2 has a higher precedence than
N   operator1, the subexpression (term2 operator2 term3) is evaluated
N   first. The same rule is applied repeatedly as necessary.
N
NNote, however, that individual terms are evaluated from left to right
Nin the expression (that is, as soon as they are encountered). The
Nprecedence rules affect only the order of operations.
M
MI encourage you to use parentheses for readability.
