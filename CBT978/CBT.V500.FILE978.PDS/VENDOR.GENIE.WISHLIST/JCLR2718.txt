NJES2 Control Statement
N======================
NJECL /*SETUP Statement
N----------------------
NUse the /*SETUP statement to identify volumes that the operator should
Nmount before the job is executed. When the job enters the system, JES2
Nissues a message to the operator console, asking the operator to mount
Nthe identified volumes. JES2 then places the job in hold status until
Nthe operator mounts the volumes and releases the job.
N
MBack when there were not so many messages going to consoles you could
Muse the /*SETUP control card to let the operator know what tape
Mvolume serial numbers the job would need. Nowadays, too many messages
Mare produced for any HUMAN to really read them and two other
Mtechnologies did away with this practice.
N
M1) Use of catalogued data sets means no one wants to look up what
M   VOLSESRs will be used and code them in JCL that job scheduling
M   software is submitting.
M2) Automated tape devices mount more tapes than people do, and they
M   do nOt read console messages.
N
D/*SETUP Ý,serial-number¨
I    serial-number: Identifies by serial number the volume(s). A volume
I      serial number is 1 through 6 alphanumeric, national ($, #, @),
I      or special characters; enclose a serial number that contains
I      special characters, other than hyphens, in apostrophes. If the
I      number is shorter than 6 characters, it is padded with trailing
I      blanks.
