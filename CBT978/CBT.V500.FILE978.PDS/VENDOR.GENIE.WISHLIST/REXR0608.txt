NDefinition

NNumeric information
N-------------------
NTo determine the current settings of the NUMERIC options, use the
Nbuilt-in functions DIGITS, FORM, and FUZZ. These functions return the
Ncurrent settings of NUMERIC DIGITS, NUMERIC FORM, and NUMERIC FUZZ,
Nrespectively.

NWhole numbers
N-------------
NWithin the set of numbers REXX understands, it is useful to distinguish
Nthe subset defined as whole numbers. A whole number in REXX is a number
Nthat has a decimal part that is all zeros (or that has no decimal
Npart). In addition, it must be possible to express its integer part
Nsimply as digits within the precision set by the NUMERIC DIGITS
Ninstruction. REXX would express larger numbers in exponential notation,
Nafter rounding, and, therefore, these could no longer be safely
Ndescribed or used as whole numbers.
