NAppendix A. Invoking Utility Programs from an Application Program
N-----------------------------------------------------------------
This appendix documents Programming Interface and Associated Guidance
NInformation provided by DFSMS.
N
NThis appendix is intended to help you invoke a utility program from an
Napplication program.
N
NYou can start a utility program through an application program by using
Nthe LINK macro instructions. (ATTACH may also be used, but additional
Nparameters are needed.)
N
NYou must supply the information that is usually specified in the PARM
Nparameter of the EXEC statement, and any nonstandard ddnames that
Ndefine the data sets that you want the utility to use.
N
NNote: All parameters must reside below the line (that is, have 24 bit
Naddresses).
N
When invoking IEBCOMPR, IEBCOPY, IEBDG, IEBGENER, IEBPTPCH, IEHLIST,
NIEHMOVE, or IEHPROGM from an application program or the
NTSO CALL command, you must dynamically allocate the device by issuing
NSVC 99 before calling the utility or you must use the JCL or
NTSO ALLOCATE equivalent.
N
NIEHINITT, IEHMOVE, and IEHPROGM are APF (authorized program facility)
Nprograms. When executing an authorized program, the calling program
Nmust also be authorized. If you are using TSO, the TSO service routine
NIKJEFTSR may be used by an unauthorized program to invoke an authorized
Nprogram such as IEHINITT.
