NExample 11: Replace a Load Module Using COPYMOD
N-----------------------------------------------
NIn this example, a load module in an existing load library is replaced
Nby another module. The new module originally resides on a 3390 DASD
Ndevice, whereas the load library to which it is copied resides on a
N3380. Because the module has a block size larger than the block size
Nassigned to the output data set, the module must be reblocked before it
Nis added to the load library.
N
NThis example illustrates how you can transfer load modules between
Ndevices of different sizes. In this case, updated modules are created
Non a 3390 and tested before being added to the load library for general
Nuse.

D//REPLACE  JOB ...
D//ST01#01 EXEC PGM=IEBCOPY
D//SYSPRINT  DD SYSOUT=*
D//TESTLIB   DD DISP=(SHR),DSN=JOHNDOE.COBOL.TESTLOAD
D//PRODLIB   DD DISP=(OLD),DSN=PAYROLL.MASTER.LOADLIB
D//SYSIN     DD *
D         COPYMOD OUTDD=PRODLIB,INDD=TESTLIB
D         SELECT  MEMBER=((WAGETAX,,R))
D/*
N
NThe control statements are discussed below:
N
N  TESTLIB DD defines a load library on a 3390 direct access device. It
N  has a block size of 23470.
N
N  PRODLIB DD defines a load library on a 3380 direct access device. It
N  has a block size of 19069.
N
N  SYSIN DD defines the control data set, which follows in the input
N  stream.
N
N  The COPYMOD statement identifies PAYROLL.MASTER.LOADLIB as the
N  output data set and JOHNDOE.COBOL.TESTLOAD as the input data set.
N  The SELECT statement indicates that the load module WAGETAX is to be
N  copied from the input data set and is to replace any member with
N  that name that is in the output data set. The member is also
N  reblocked to 19069.
M
MNote that, in this case, COPYMOD has to be used in order to copy the
Mmember WAGETAX into the PAYROLL.MASTER.LOADLIB. Because the original
Mblock size of WAGETAX is larger than the largest block size that can
Mreside in the output data set, attempting this operation with the COPY
Mstatement would be unsuccessful. The problem would be attributed to a
MDCB validation error because of incorrect block size.
