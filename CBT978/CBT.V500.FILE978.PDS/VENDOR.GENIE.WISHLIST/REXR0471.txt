N------------------------
NGETMSG
N-------
NGETMSG returns a function code that replaces the function call and
Nretrieves, in variables, a message that has been issued during a
Nconsole session.
N
NVariables GETMSG sets for the entire message
N--------------------------------------------
NGETMSG sets specific variables that relate to the entire message that
Nit retrieves.
N
NGETMSG sets these variables, regardless of how many lines of
Ntext the retrieved message contains. The names of the variables
Nthat GETMSG sets correspond to the field names in the message
Ndata block (MDB) in MVS/ESA System Product. The variable names
Nconsist of the msgstem you specified on the call to GETMSG followed
Nby the name of the field in the MDB. That is, TSO/E uses the name
Nof the field in the MDB as the suffix for the variable name and
Nconcatenates the MDB field name to the msgstem. For example,
None field in the MDB is MDBLEN, which is the length of the MDB.
N
NIf you specify msgstem as CONSMSG. (with a period), REXX
Nreturns the length of the MDB in the variable: CONSMSG.MDBLEN
N
NIf you specify msgstem as CMSG (without a period), the
Nvariable name would be CMSGMDBLEN.
N
NFor any variable that needs a minimum MVS release to have
Na proper value returned, this minimum prerequisite release
Nis listed in the second column. For detailed information
Nabout the MDB and each field in the MDB, see z/OS MVS Data
NAreas, Vol 3 (IVT-RCWK).

NSyntax:
D  GETMSG(msgstem, msgtype, cart, mask, time)
I    msgstem: the stem of the list of variables into which GETMSG
I             places the message text. To place the message text into
I             compound variables, which allow for indexing, msgstem
I             should end with a period (for example, 'messg.').
N
I    msgtype: the type of message you want to retrieve. Specify one of
I             the following values for msgtype:
N
I             -> SOL: indicates that you want to retrieve a solicited
I                     message. A solicited message is the response from
I                     an MVS system or subsystem command.
N
I             -> UNSOL: indicates that you want to retrieve an
I                       unsolicited message. An unsolicited message is
I                       any message that is not issued in response to
I                       an MVS system or subsystem command. For example,
I                       an unsolicited message may be a message that
I                       another user sends you or a broadcast message.
N
I             -> EITHER: indicates that you want to retrieve either type
I                        of message (solicited or unsolicited). If you
I                        do not specify the msgtype argument, EITHER is
I                        the default.
N
I    cart: the command and response token (CART). The CART is a token
I          that lets you associate MVS system commands and subcommands
I          with their responses. When you issue an MVS system or
I          subsystem command, you can specify a CART on the command
I          invocation. To use GETMSG to retrieve a particular message
I          that is in direct response to the command invoked, specify
I          the same CART value.
N
I    mask: search argument that GETMSG uses as a mask with the cart
I          argument for obtaining a message. If you specify a mask,
I          GETMSG ANDs the mask value with the CART value that you
I          specify on the GETMSG function. GETMSG also ANDs the mask
I          with the CARTs associated with the messages that have been
I          routed to the user's console. GETMSG then compares the
I          results of the AND operations. If a comparison matches,
I          GETMSG retrieves the message. Otherwise, no message is
I          retrieved.
N
II         The mask argument is valid only if you are retrieving
I          solicited messages and are using a CART. That is, mask is
I          valid only if you specify SOL for msgtype and you specify
I          the cart argument.
N
I    time: the amount of time, in seconds, that GETMSG should wait,
I          if the requested message has not yet been routed to the
I          user's console. If you specify a time value and the time
I          expires before the message is routed to the user's console,
I          GETMSG does not retrieve the message. Otherwise, if the
I          message is available before the time expires, GETMSG
I          retrieves the message.
N
N
NExample
N-------
NYou want to retrieve a list of unsolicited messages, including both
Nsingle line messages and multiple line messages.
N
I  CONSOLE ACTIVATE
I
I  msgindex = 0
I  mrc = 0
I  DO WHILE mrc = 0
I    SAY "WAIT UP TO 15 SECONDS FOR MESSAGE TRAFFIC."
I    mrc = GETMSG("cnsl.","UNSOL",,,15)
I    IF mrc > 0 THEN LEAVE
I    DO i = 1 TO cnsl.0
I      msgindex = msgindex + 1
I      msg.msgindex = cnsl.i
I    END
I  END
I  msg.0 = msgindex
I  DO i = 1 TO msg.0
