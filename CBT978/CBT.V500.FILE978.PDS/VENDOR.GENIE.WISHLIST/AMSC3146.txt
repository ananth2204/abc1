NCase 16: Using Dual Copy to Migrate Volumes
N-------------------------------------------
NThe following steps show how to migrate data from one device to
Nanother without disrupting the application. Separate procedures are
Nprovided for simplex volumes and duplex pair volumes.
N
NNotes:
N  1. When you use dual copy to migrate volumes, remember that the
N     correspondence between the original CCA and DDC addresses is
N     switched and that the Storage Control retains the updated
N     CCA-to-DDC address correspondence.
N
N     Use the message response to the DEVSERV PATHS command to identify
N     the current CCA-to-DDC relationship.
N
N  2. When you use dual copy to migrate from 3390 devices to RAMAC
N     devices, an invalid format 4 DSCB is created on the target device.
N     Use ICKDSF to fix the format 4 DSCB. See your IBM representative
N     for the latest service level of ICKDSF that provides this
N     function.
