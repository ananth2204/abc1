NChapter 25. PROFILE resources
N-----------------------------
NSyntax:
N-------
D  DEFINE
D    PROFILE(name)
I      Specifies the name of this PROFILE definition. The
I      name can be up to eight characters in length.
N
I      It is preferable not to use names that start with DFH because
I      these characters are reserved for use by CICS.
N
I      CICS can delete or discard them and replace them with CICS
I      resources when you upgrade or provide new function or fixes.
N
I      Note: If you use a comma (,) in a name, you will be unable to use
I      those commands such as CEMT INQUIRE PROFILE(value1,value2) where
I      the comma serves as a list delimiter. See CICS Supplied
I      Transactions for information about using lists of resource
I      identifiers.
N
I      A profile specifies the options that control the interaction
I      between CICS and a terminal or logical unit. A profile name is
I      specified on the transaction definition to indicate the set of
I      options that control the communication between the transaction
I      and its principal terminal. You can also specify a profile name
I      on an EXEC CICS ALLOCATE command to indicate the options that
I      control communication between the transaction and the allocated
I      session.
N
I      CICS supplies a number of profile definitions that are suitable
I      for most purposes. For more information, see the
I      CICS Intercommunication Guide.
N
D    GROUP(groupname)
I      Every resource definition must have a GROUP name.
I      The resource definition becomes a member of the group and is
I      installed in the CICS system when the group is installed.
N
I      The GROUP name can be up to 8 characters in length. Lowercase
I      characters are treated as uppercase characters.
N
D    DESCRIPTION(text)
I      You can provide a description of the resource that
I      you are defining in this field. The description text can be up to
I      58 characters in length. No restrictions apply to the characters
I      that you can use. However, if you use parentheses, ensure that for
I      each left parenthesis there is a matching right parenthesis. If you
I      use the CREATE command, for each single apostrophe in the text,
I      code two apostrophes.
N
D    CHAINCONTROL(NO | YES)
I      Specifies whether the application program
I      can control the outbound chaining of request units. If you specify
I      CHAINCONTROL(YES), ONEWTE(YES) means one chain and not one terminal
I      control output request.
N
D    DVSUPRT(ALL | NONVTAM | VTAM)
I      Specifies the devices (terminals or
I      logical units) that are to be supported. The access method used by
I      a particular terminal or logical unit is specified in its
I      associated TCTTE.
N
I      ALL The profile can be used with any terminal or logical unit.
N
I      NONVTAM: The profile can be used only with non-z/OS Communications
I        Server terminals.
N
I      VTAM: The profile can be used only with logical units.
N
D    FACILITYLIKE(terminal)
I      This is an optional attribute that specifies
I      the name of an existing (four-character) terminal resource
I      definition to be used as a template for the bridge facility. It
I      can be overridden by specifying FACILITYLIKE in the bridge exit.
N
I      There is no default value for this attribute.
N
I      If you are running in a CICS system started with the VTAM=NO
I      system initialization (SIT) parameter, the resource definition
I      specified by FACILITYLIKE must be defined as a remote terminal.
N
D    INBFMH(NO | ALL | DIP | EODS)
I      Specifies, for profiles
I      used with logical units, whether a function management header
I      (FMH) received from a logical unit is to be passed to the
I      application program.
N
I      ALL: All FMHs (except APPC FMHs and LU6.1 ATTACH and SYNCPOINT
I      FMHs that are processed by CICS) are passed to the application
I      program. This value is required for function shipping transactions
I      such as CSMI, transactions which use distributed transaction
I      processing, and for distributed program link requests.
N
I      DIP: The batch data interchange program (DFHDIP) is to process
I        inbound FMHs. BMS issues a batch data interchange receive
I        request if a BMS receive request has been issued, and a batch
I        data interchange receive request is issued instead of a terminal
I        control receive request.
N
I      EODS: An FMH is passed to the application program only if it
I        indicates end of data set (EODS).
N
I      NO: The FMHs are discarded.
N
D    JOURNAL(NO | journal)
I      Specifies that you want automatic journaling
I      of messages to take place, by giving the identifier of the journal.
N
I      NO: No automatic journaling of messages is to take place.
N
I      journal: The journal identification to be used for automatic
I        journaling. This can be any number in the range 01 through 99.
I        This number is appended to the letters DFHJ to give a journal
I        identification of the form DFHJnn and this maps to an MVS system
I        logger general log stream.
N
I      Note: In CICS Transaction Server for z/OS, DFHJ01 is not the
I      system log.
N
I      In a transaction routing environment, message journaling is
I      performed in the application-owning region (AOR). Therefore, you
I      should specify the JOURNAL attribute on the transaction profile
I      in the AOR.
N
D    LOGREC(NO | YES)
I      Specifies whether the design of the application
I      requires that each EXEC CICS RECEIVE request is to be satisfied by
I      a logical record. This option allows existing 2770- and 2780-based
I      application programs to be attached to a batch logical unit (for
I      example, 3790 or 8100) without modification to the program.
N
D    MODENAME(modename)
I      Specifies the name that identifies a group of
I      sessions for use on an APPC connection. The name can be up to
I      eight characters in length, and must be the name of a
I      z/OS Communications Server LOGMODE entry defined to
I      z/OS Communications Server. It must not be the reserved name
I      SNASVCMG. If you omit the modename, it defaults to blanks. See
I      the CICS Intercommunication Guide for more information about
I      z/OS Communications Server modenames.
N
I      If a transaction that specifies this profile has been started using
I      an EXEC CICS START command, the MODENAME is used for allocation of
I      the principal facility. If a transaction performs an
I      EXEC CICS ALLOCATE command specifying this profile, the MODENAME
I      is used for allocation of the alternate facility.
N
I      If you do not specify a MODENAME, CICS selects a session from any
I      one of the mode sets that have been defined.
N
I      The CICS-supplied profile DFHCICSA is used, if PROFILE is not
I      specified on an EXEC CICS ALLOCATE command. For function shipping,
I      the profile DFHCICSF is always used. MODENAME is not specified on
I      the definition for either of these profiles, but you can add a
I      MODENAME if you make your own copy. You must then ensure that the
I      mode sets using your MODENAME have been defined in the TERMINAL or
I      SESSIONS definition for all the systems with which communication
I      takes place using APPC.
N
I      If a MODENAME is specified and you want to remove it, delete
I      completely the value previously specified by pressing the
I      ERASE EOF key.
N
D    MSGINTEG(NO | YES)
I      (SNA LUs only): specifies whether a definite
I      response is to be requested with an output request to a logical
I      unit. You cannot specify YES for a pipeline transaction.
N
D    MSGJRNL(NO | INOUT | INPUT | OUTPUT)
I      Specifies which messages are to
I      be automatically journaled. If you specify a value other than NO,
I      you must also supply a value for the JOURNAL attribute.
N
I      NO: No message journaling is required.
N
I      INPUT: Journaling is required for input messages.
N
I      OUTPUT: Journaling is to be performed for output messages.
N
I      INOUT: Journaling is to be performed for input and output messages.
N
I      In a transaction routing environment, message journaling is
I      performed in the application-owning region (AOR) for routed
I      APPC (LU type 6.2) sessions, and you should specify the MSGJRNL
I      attribute on the transaction profile in the AOR. For other routed
I      sessions, message journaling is performed in the terminal-owning
I      region (TOR). In this case, you should specify the MSGJRNL
I      attribute on the transaction profile in the TOR.
N
D    NEPCLASS(0 | nepclass)
I      (z/OS Communications Server only): specifies
I      the node error program transaction class. This value overrides the
I      value specified on the TYPETERM and SESSION definitions.
N
I      0: This results in a link to the default node error program module
I        for z/OS Communications Server devices, or is the default value
I        for non-z/OS Communications Server devices.
N
I      value: The transaction class for the (nondefault) node error
I        program module.
N
I      The value can be in the range 1 through 255. For programming
I      information on the node error program, see the CICS Customization
I      Guide.
N
I      The NEPCLASS attribute applies only to user transactions, and is
I      ignored for SNASVCMGR sessions.
N
D    ONEWTE(NO | YES)
I      Specifies whether the transaction is permitted
I      only one write operation or EXEC CICS SEND during its execution.
N
I      YES: has the effect of forcing the LAST option on the first write
I        of the transaction. Any additional write requests are treated as
I        errors, and the task is made ready for abnormal termination.
N
I      You must specify YES for a PIPELINE transaction.
N
D    PRINTERCOMP(NO | YES)
I      Specifies the level of compatibility required
I      for the generation of data streams to support the printer
I      compatibility option for the BMS SEND TEXT command.
N
I      NO: Each line of output starts with a blank character, so that
I        the format is equivalent to that on a 3270 display where an
I        attribute byte precedes each line.
N
I      YES: No blank character is inserted, so that forms-feed characters
I        included as the first character of your data are honored and the
I        full width of the printer is available for your data.
N
I      If you use the BMS forms feed option, specify YES.
N
D    PROTECT(NO | YES)
I      This attribute is obsolete, but is supported to provide
I      compatibility with earlier releases of CICS. For more information,
I      see Appendix A, "Obsolete attributes".
N
D    RAQ(NO | YES)
I      Specifies whether the
I      'read ahead queuing' option is required.
N
I      NO: The transaction obeys SNA protocols and only SEND and RECEIVE
I        when in the correct mode. If it does not follow the protocol,
I        it may be abended with code ATCV.
N
I      YES: The transaction may not obey SNA protocols, and CICS queues
I        incoming data on temporary storage until the data is specifically
I        requested by the transaction. RAQ(YES) is provided only for
I        compatibility with transactions that support both bisynchronous
I        devices and logical units, and its use is not recommended.
N
D    RTIMOUT(NO | mmss)
I      Specifies the timeout value for the read timeout
I      feature. For tasks that are making HTTP client requests using the
I      EXEC CICS WEB API, when this interval has ended, CICS returns a
I      TIMEDOUT response to the application. For other tasks, either the
I      failed command returns a TERMERR or the task that is timed out
I      receives an AKCT , AZCT, or AZIG abend.
N
I      NO: The read timeout feature is not required.
N
I      value: This is an interval (MMSS for minutes and seconds) after
I        which the task is terminated if no input has been received from
I        the terminal. The maximum value that can be specified is
I        70 minutes. If a value is specified and you want to let it
I        default to NO, you must completely delete the value previously
I        specified.
N
D    SCRNSIZE(DEFAULT | ALTERNATE)
I      Specifies whether the DEFAULT or
I      ALTERNATE buffer size for a 3270 display or printer is to be used.
I      For further information on the choice of screen sizes and buffer
I      sizes, refer to the ALTSCREEN and DEFSCREEN attributes on the
I      TYPETERM definition.
N
I      The SCRNSIZE value is ignored if the TYPETERM definition has
I      ALTSCREEN(0,0) and DEFSCREEN(0,0). That is, the screen size is
I      assumed from the related TERMMODEL attribute in the TYPETERM
I      definition; the page size is taken from PAGESIZE, and the ALTPAGE
I      value is ignored. The 3270 erase write (EW) command is inserted
I      for output requests with the ERASE option.
N
I      ALTERNATE: If the TYPETERM definition has nonzero ALTSCREEN, the
I        alternate screen size mode is applied, using the erase write
I        alternate (EWA) command. That is, whenever a terminal output
I        request with the ERASE option is issued, the 3270 EWA command
I        is inserted in the data stream. The ALTSCREEN value is assumed
I        as the screen size, and BMS uses the value in ALTPAGE as the page
I        size. SCRNSIZE(ALTERNATE) may be used for all CICS service
I        transactions (for example, CSMT).
N
I      DEFAULT: If the TYPETERM definition has nonzero ALTSCREEN or
I        nonzero DEFSCREEN, the default screen size mode is applied,
I        using the erase write (EW) command. That is, whenever the
I        terminal issues a terminal output request with the ERASE
I        option, the 3270 EW command is inserted in the data stream.
I        The screen size specified in the DEFSCREEN attribute is assumed,
I        and BMS uses the value specified in the PAGESIZE attribute as
I        the page size.
N
I      Note: Both DEFAULT and ALTERNATE can be overridden by the DEFAULT
I      and ALTERNATE options on the SEND MAP, SEND TEXT, and SEND CONTROL
I      commands.
N
D    UCTRAN(NO | YES)
I      (z/OS Communications Server only): Specifies whether
I      terminal input is to be translated to uppercase before passing to
I      programs for the transaction using this profile.
N
I      You can also request translation to uppercase at the terminal level
I      on the associated TYPETERM definition (see "TYPETERM attributes")
I      but be aware of the following points:
N
I      -> A TYPETERM UCTRAN(YES) definition overrides a PROFILE UCTRAN(NO)
I         definition. So, if you specify TYPETERM UCTRAN(YES), a
I         PROFILE UCTRAN(NO) has no effect.
N
I      -> A PROFILE UCTRAN(YES) definition overrides a TYPETERM UCTRAN(NO)
I         definition.
N
I      -> Specifying TYPETERM UCTRAN(TRANID) causes the tranid to be
I         translated to uppercase so that CICS can locate the transaction
I         definition. All other input received by the application is
I         translated according to what is specified for PROFILE UCTRAN.
N
I      -> UCTRAN(YES) on a profile definition does not cause translation
I         of the input data until an EXEC CICS RECEIVE or CONVERSE is
I         executed. This means that if the transaction is routed through
I         a dynamic routing program, for example DFHDYP, the copy of the
I         input data passed to the routing program is unaffected by the
I         UCTRAN option of the PROFILE definition.
N
I      Note: In a transaction routing environment where your
I      z/OS Communications Server terminals have a remote definition on
I      the AOR, and the AOR has a different UCTRAN value from the TOR,
I      the TOR value of UCTRANST (as specified in an
I      EXEC CICS SET TERMINAL command) overrides that on the AOR.
N
I      Table 11 shows which portion of the terminal input is translated
I      (transaction id and/or data) according to the setting of the UCTRAN
I      on the PROFILE and TYPETERM resource definitions.
N
I      Some national-language characters are not automatically translated
I      when UCTRAN(YES) is specified. If that is the case, you can use one
I      of the methods described in the CICS Customization Guide.
