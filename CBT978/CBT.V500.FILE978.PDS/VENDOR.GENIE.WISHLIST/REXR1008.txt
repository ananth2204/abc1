NChapter 10. TSO/E REXX commands
N-------------------------------
NMAKEBUF
N--------
NUse the MAKEBUF command to create a new buffer on the data stack. The
NMAKEBUF command can be issued from REXX execs that execute in both the
NTSO/E address space and non-TSO/E address spaces.
N
NInitially, the data stack contains one buffer, which is known as
Nbuffer 0. You create additional buffers using the MAKEBUF command.
NMAKEBUF returns the number of the buffer it creates in the REXX special
Nvariable RC. For example, the first time an exec issues MAKEBUF, it
Ncreates the first buffer and returns a 1 in the special variable RC.
NThe second time MAKEBUF is used, it creates another buffer and returns
Na 2 in the special variable RC.
N
NTo remove buffers from the data stack that were created with the
NMAKEBUF command, use the DROPBUF command
N
N
NSyntax:
