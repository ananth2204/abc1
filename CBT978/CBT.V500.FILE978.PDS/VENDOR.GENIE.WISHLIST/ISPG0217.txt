NChapter 2. Description of the ISPF services
N-------------------------------------------
NFTOPEN-Begin file tailoring
N---------------------------
NThe FTOPEN service, which begins the file tailoring process, allows
Nskeleton files to be accessed from the skeleton library specified by
Nddname ISPSLIB. The skeleton library must be allocated before invoking
NISPF. ISPSLIB can specify a concatenation of files.
N
NIf output from file tailoring is not to be placed in a temporary file,
Nthe desired output file must be allocated to the ddname ISPFILE before
Ninvoking this service. ISPFILE can designate either a library or a
Nsequential file. The skeleton files can contain variable-length
Nrecords, with a maximum record length of 255.
N
NThe same rules apply for DBCS-related variable substitution in file
Ntailoring as those described for file skeleton definition.
N
NCommand invocation format
N-------------------------
D  ADDRESS ISPEXEC "FTOPEN" ,
D    "TEMP"
I      Specifies that the output of the file tailoring process should
I      be placed in a temporary sequential file. Output is fixed-length
I      80-byte records. The file is automatically allocated by ISPF.
I      Its name is available in system variable ZTEMPF.
N
I      If this parameter is omitted, the output is placed in the library
I      or sequential file designated by ddname ISPFILE.
N
I      ZTEMPF contains a fully qualified data set name. ZTEMPN contains
I      the ddname. Generated JCL in this file can be substituted for
I      background execution by using the TSO command:
N
I        SUBMIT '&ZTEMPF'
N
I      Before issuing the SUBMIT command, the VGET service should be
I      invoked to initialize the variable ZTEMPF, and the FTCLOSE
I      service must be invoked to ensure that all of the file tailoring
I      output is included.
N
NReturn codes
N------------
NThese return codes are possible:
N
D  ftopen_rc = RC
D  SELECT
D    WHEN (ftopen_rc = 0) THEN DO
D      /* Normal completion. */
D      NOP
D    END
D    WHEN (ftopen_rc = 8) THEN DO
D      /* File tailoring already in progress. */
D      SAY "Ask your programmer to fix the logic, already FTOPEN."
D      SAY ZERRSM
D      SAY ZERRLM
D    END
D    WHEN (ftopen_rc = 12) THEN DO
D      /* Output file in use; ENQ failed. */
D      SAY "Ask your programmer to redrive using a FREE file."
D      SAY ZERRSM
D      SAY ZERRLM
D    END
D    WHEN (ftopen_rc = 16) THEN DO
D      /* Skeleton library or output file not allocated. */
D      SAY "Ask your programmer to allocate the file."
D      SAY ZERRSM
D      SAY ZERRLM
D    END
D    WHEN (ftopen_rc = 20) THEN DO
D      /* Severe error. */
D      SAY "Ask your programmer to fix the severe error."
D      SAY ZERRSM
D      SAY ZERRLM
D    END
D    OTHERWISE DO
D      SAY "Something very unexpected happened, RC("ftopen_rc")."
D    END
D  END
N
NExample 1: Prepare for access (open) both libraries.

I  ADDRESS ISPEXEC "CONTROL ERRORS RETURN"
I  ADDRESS ISPEXEC "FTOPEN"
