NOUTPUT JCL Statement
N====================
NJESDS Parameter
N---------------
NUse the JESDS parameter to process the job's system-managed data sets
Naccording to the parameters on this OUTPUT JCL statement. The
Nsystem-managed data sets consist of:
N
N->The job log, which is a record of job-related information for the
N  programmer. Printing of the job log is controlled by two JOB
N  statement parameters: the MSGLEVEL parameter controls what is
N  printed and the MSGCLASS parameter controls the system output
N  class.
N
N->The job's hard-copy log, which is a record of all message traffic
N  for the job to and from the operator console.
N
N->System messages for the job.
N
D//outds OUTPUT JESDS={ALL | JCL | LOG | MSG}
I                 ALL: Indicates that this OUTPUT JCL statement applies
I                   to all of the job's system-managed data sets.
I
I                 LOG: Indicates that this OUTPUT JCL statement applies
I                   only to the JESMSGLG data set, which contains the
I                   JES and operator messages for this job.
I
I                 JCL: Indicates that this OUTPUT JCL statement applies
I                   only to the JESJCL data set, which contains the JCL
I                   statements for this job.
I
I                 MSG: Indicates that this OUTPUT JCL statement applies
I                   only to the JESYSMSG data set, which contains any
I                   JCL error messages and any system messages for
I                   this job.
N
NExample 1: Dual spin-off.
N-------------------------
NIn this example, JES produces two copies of the system-managed
Ndata sets:
N->one copy for OUTPUT JCL statement OUT1 and
N->one copy for OUTPUT JCL statement OUT2.
N
NThe copy for statement OUT2 is sent to AUSTIN.
