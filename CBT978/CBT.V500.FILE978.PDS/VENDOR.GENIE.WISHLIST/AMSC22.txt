NChapter 22. EXAMINE
N-------------------
NThe EXAMINE command analyzes and reports on the structural integrity of
Nthe index and data components of a key-sequenced data set cluster
N(KSDS) and of a variable-length relative record data set cluster
N(VRRDS). In addition, EXAMINE can analyze and report on the structural
Nintegrity of the basic catalog structure (BCS) of a catalog.
N
NSee z/OS DFSMS Using Data Sets for more information on KSDSs and
NVRRDSs. See How to Run Examine and Understanding Message Hierarchy in
Nz/OS DFSMS Managing Catalogs for more information on BCSs. Search
NChapter 21, "DIAGNOSE" for information on the DIAGNOSE command, which
Ninspects the contents of a VVDS or a BCS and looks for logical
Nsynchronization errors.
N
NRecommendation: For increased integrity checking, use EXAMINE on the
Nhighest available release. Before using EXAMINE with a catalog or data
Nset that has been closed improperly (as a result of a CANCEL, ABEND or
Nsystem error), use the VERIFY RECOVER command. For more information,
Nsearch Chapter 33, "VERIFY".
N
MLong ago an implicit VERIFY was added when a cluster is opened. Doing
Mso manually is superfluous unless done with condition checking to
Mhighlight a CANCEL, ABEND, OR system error was the most recent reason
Mfor closure.
