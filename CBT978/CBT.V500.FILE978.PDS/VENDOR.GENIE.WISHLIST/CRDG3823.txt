NThe DFHCSDUP SERVICE command
N----------------------------
NCarry out maintenance to your CSD file.

D  Service FRomcsd ( ddname ) LEvel ( nnn )
N
NOptions
N-------
N    FRomcsd(ddname): specifies the ddname of the current CSD file,
N                     which for the purposes of the command is treated
N                     as the secondary CSD file.
N
N    LEvel(nnn): Associated with your CSD file is a current service
N                level, initially set to 000 when the file was
N                initialized. Applying the service routine causes the
N                service level to be incremented in steps of one, from
N                a "current level" to a "target level".
N
N                This operand specifies the target service level to
N                which the CSD file is to be upgraded, and must be 1
N                higher than the current level of FROMCSD. Specify it
N                as a 3-character integer; for example, LEVEL(001).
