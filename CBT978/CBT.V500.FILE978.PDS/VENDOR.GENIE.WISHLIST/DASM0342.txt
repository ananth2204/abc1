NData set utilities
N------------------
NData set utilities reorganize, change, or compare data at the data set
Nor record level. These programs are widely used in batch jobs.
N
NThese utilities allow you to manipulate partitioned, sequential or
Nindexed sequential data sets, or partitioned data sets extended
N(PDSEs), which are provided as input to the programs. You can
Nmanipulate data ranging from fields within a logical record to entire
Ndata sets. These data set utilities cannot be used with VSAM data sets.
