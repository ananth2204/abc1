NChapter 10. DB2TRAN resources
N-----------------------------
NA DB2TRAN defines a transaction, or a group of transactions, associated
Nwith a DB2ENTRY, that are additional to the transactions specified in
Nthe DB2ENTRY itself.
N
NOnly one DB2TRAN definition can be installed for a specific
Ntransaction. An attempt to install a second DB2TRAN definition
Nexplicitly referring to the same transaction ID will fail.
N
NThe DB2TRAN definition allows a DB2ENTRY to have an unrestricted
Nnumber of transactions associated with it, including names using
Nwildcard characters. You can define any number of DB2TRANs to be
Nassociated with a single DB2ENTRY.
N
NInstalling DB2 entry definitions
N--------------------------------
NThis section describes the guidelines for installing and discarding
NDB2TRAN definitions and the implications of interruptions in partial
Nactivity.
N
NAbout this task
N---------------
N-> You cannot install more than one DB2TRAN for the same transaction,
N   if you have given the full transaction ID in the DB2TRAN definition.
N   If you have used a generic transaction ID with a wildcard character,
N   you can install more than one DB2TRAN that potentially matches the
N   transaction, but CICS only uses the closest match (* and +).
N
N-> A DB2TRAN that refers to a non-existent DB2ENTRY cannot be
N   installed. The DB2ENTRY must be installed first.
N
N-> Note that when DB2ENTRY and DB2TRAN definitions are defined in the
N   same group, CICS installs the DB2ENTRY first at install time.
N
N-> You can install a new DB2TRAN at any time, even when the CICS DB2
N   adapter is connected to DB2.
N
N-> A DB2TRAN can be re-installed at any time, and can be discarded at
N   any time.
