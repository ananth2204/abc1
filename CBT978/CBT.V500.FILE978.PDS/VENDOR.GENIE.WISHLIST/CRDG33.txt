NChapter 33. TSMODEL resources
N-----------------------------
NA temporary storage model specifies the properties of a set of TS
Nqueues. Individual TS queues are associated with a TSMODEL by the
Nprefix, a character string that matches the leading characters of the
Nqueue name.
N
NYou can also map names directly to a shared TS pool (without the need
Nfor a shared sysid).
N
NNote: CICS takes default actions on a region where a TSMODEL is not
Ndefined. This means that if you have an AOR and a QOR, and a TSMODEL
Ndefined in the AOR directs requests to the QOR, then unless a
Ncorresponding TSMODEL exists in the QOR, some queue attributes are
Ntaken from default values. For example, the location of a queue (MAIN
Nor AUX) is determined from default settings within CICS. If there is
Nno matching model, the location that is specified in the EXEC CICS
Ncommand is used; if there is a model match, the location in this is
Nused.
