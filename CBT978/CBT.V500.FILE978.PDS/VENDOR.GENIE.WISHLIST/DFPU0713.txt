NExample 13: Delete Graphic References From a Character
NArrangement Table Module
N------------------------------------------------------
N3800 Model 3
N
NIn this example, an existing character arrangement table module is
Ncopied and used as a basis for a new one. The new character arrangement
Ntable deletes references to all graphic character modification modules
Nand resets the translate table entries that were used to point to
Ncharacter positions for the segments of a graphic character
Nmodification module.

D//ST01#01 EXEC PGM=IEBIMAGE
D//SYSUT1    DD DISP=(OLD),DSN=SYS1.IMAGELIB

NThe control statements are discussed below:
N
N  The SYSUT1 DD statement includes DISP=OLD to ensure that no other
N  job can modify the data set while this job is executing.
N
N  The INCLUDE statement specifies that a copy of the character
N  arrangement table named ZYL is to be used as a basis for the new
N  module.
N
N  The OPTION statement with the DEVICE parameter specifies 3800 Model
N  3 compatibility mode processing.
N
N  The TABLE statement deletes references to graphic character
N  modification modules and resets two translation table entries:
I
I    GCMLIST=DELETE specifies that all names of graphic character
I    modification modules included with the module when the ZYL
I    character arrangement table was copied are to be reset to blanks
I    (X'40').
I
I    The LOC parameter identifies two locations in the translation
I    table, X'6A' and X'6B', that are to be set to X'FF' (the default
I    value when no character position or WCGM values are specified).
I
N  The name of the new character arrangement table is ZYLA; it is
N  stored as a member of the SYS1.IMAGELIB data set.
