NDD Statements That Describe the Sort Work Files
N-----------------------------------------------
NVSAM data set space available for the sort routine can be identified by
Nspecifying two ddnames with the WORKFILES parameter and supplying two
NDD statements that describe the work files to be defined. Each work
Nfile DD statement should be coded:
N
N//ddname    DD DISP=OLD,DSNAME=dsname,
N//             UNIT=devtype,VOL=SER=volser,AMP='AMORG'
N
N
NException: WORKFILES is ignored when DFSORT is available to do the
Nsorting of the alternate index and you have not overridden the default
Nby specifying NOSORTCALL.
N
I  ddname: as specified in the WORKFILES parameter. If you do not
N    specify the WORKFILES parameter and you intend to provide VSAM
N    data set space for external sort work files, identify the work
N    file DD statements with the names IDCUT1 and IDCUT2.
N
I  DISP=OLD: Required.
N
I  dsname: Specifies the name for this ddname.
N
I  UNIT=devtype: type of direct access device on which the volume is
N    mounted. You can specify a generic device type (for example, 3380)
N    or a device number (for example 121). You cannot specify SYSDA.
N
M    Follow your installation's standards.
N
I  volser: Follow your installation's standards.
N
I  AMP='AMORG': Required.
N
NIf BLDINDEX is used interactively in a TSO environment, these sort
Nwork file DD statements must be in the logon procedure.
N
MThey do not need to be in the logon procedure! They just need to be
Mallocated before BLDINDEX is invoked.
