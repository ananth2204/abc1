NJCLLIB Statement
N================
NUse the JCLLIB statement to:
N->Identify the names of the private libraries that the system uses for
N  the job. The system searches the libraries for:
N
N  ->Procedures named on any EXEC statements
N  ->Groups of JCL statements (called INCLUDE groups) named on any
N    INCLUDE statements.
N
N->Identify the names of the system procedure libraries and
N  installation-defined procedure libraries that the system uses for
N  the job.
N
N->Identify the order in which the libraries are to be searched. The
N  system searches the libraries in the order in which you specify
N  them on the JCLLIB statement, prior to searching any unspecified
N  default system procedure libraries.
N
NThe JCLLIB statement allows you to code and use procedures and INCLUDE
Ngroups in a private library without the need to use system procedure
Nlibraries.
