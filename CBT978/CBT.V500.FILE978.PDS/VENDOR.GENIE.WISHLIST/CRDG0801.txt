NChapter 8. DB2CONN resources
N----------------------------
NSyntax:
N-------
D  DEFINE
D    DB2CONN(name)
I      The name to identify a DB2 connection definition.
I      The name can be up to eight characters in length.
N
D    GROUP(groupname)
I      Every resource definition must have a GROUP name.
I      The resource definition becomes a member of the group and is
I      installed in the CICS system when the group is installed.
N
I      The GROUP name can be up to eight characters in length.
I      Lowercase characters are treated as uppercase characters.
N
D    DESCRIPTION(text)
I      You can provide a description of the resource
I      that you are defining in this field. The description text can be
I      up to 58 characters in length. No restrictions apply to the
I      characters that you can use. However, if you use parentheses,
I      ensure that for each left parenthesis there is a matching right
I      parenthesis. If you use the CREATE command, for each single
I      apostrophe in the text, code two apostrophes.
N
NConnection attributes
NDescribes the attributes of the DB2CONN resource that relate to
Nthe connection.
N
D    CONNECTERROR(SQLCODE | ABEND)
I      Specifies the way that the
I      information, that CICS is not connected to DB2 because the
I      attachment facility is in 'standby mode', is reported back to an
I      application that has issued an SQL request.
N
I      ABEND: The application abends with abend code AEY9.
N
I      SQLCODE: The application receives a -923 sqlcode. SQLCODE cannot
I        be specified if STANDBYMODE is set to NOCONNECT.
N
D    DB2GROUPID(name)
I      Specifies the group ID (up to four characters) of
I      a data sharing group of DB2 subsystems. The group attach facility
I      connects CICS to any active member of this data sharing group.
I      Match the group ID to the group attachment name defined in DB2.
I      With DB2 Version 10, the group ID can be a subgroup attachment name
I      defined to DB2 which defines a subset of the data sharing group.
I      If the DB2GROUPID attribute remains blank, group attach is not
I      used.
N
I      You cannot specify both DB2GROUPID and DB2ID, the priorities are
I      as follows:
N
I      1. Specifying a DB2GROUPID blanks out any DB2ID that is already
I         set in the DB2CONN definition.
N
I      2. If you attempt to specify both a DB2GROUPID and a DB2ID on the
I         same CEDA panel, the DB2ID is used.
N
I      3. If the DB2ID of an individual subsystem is specified in a CEMT
I         Or EXEC CICS SET DB2CONN command, or in a DSNC STRT command,
I         this DB2ID overrides any DB2GROUPID attribute that is set in
I         the installed DB2CONN definition. The DB2GROUPID in the
I         installed DB2CONN definition is blanked out, and must be set
I         again (using CEDA or a SET DB2CONN command) to use group attach.
N
D    DB2ID(name)
I      Specifies the name of the DB2 subsystem to which the
I      CICS DB2 attachment facility is to connect. By default this field
I      is blank. If you want to use group attach, specify a DB2GROUPID in
I      the DB2CONN definition, instead of a DB2ID. The DB2ID set in the
I      installed DB2CONN definition can be overridden by a DB2 subsystem
I      ID specified on a DSNC STRT command, or by a DB2ID specified in a
I      SET DB2CONN command. If the DB2ID in the installed DB2CONN
I      definition remains blank, and the DB2GROUPID also remains blank,
I      you can specify a DB2 subsystem ID on the INITPARM system
I      initialization parameter. If no DB2 subsystem ID is specified by
I      any of these means, and no DB2GROUPID is specified, the default
I      DB2ID of blanks is replaced by DSN when the connection is
I      attempted. Hence, the hierarchy for determining the DB2 subsystem
I      is as follows:
N
I      1. Use the subsystem ID if it is specified in a DSNC STRT command.
N
I      2. Use the DB2ID in the installed DB2CONN if it is not blank.
N
I      3. Use the DB2GROUPID in the installed DB2CONN for group attach,
I         if it is not blank.
N
I      4. Use the subsystem ID if it is specified on the INITPARM when the
I         DB2ID and DB2GROUPID in the last installed DB2CONN are blank
I         (or have later been set to blanks). On any startup, INITPARM is
I         always used if the last installed DB2CONN contained a blank
I         DB2ID and a blank DB2GROUPID, even if the DB2ID or DB2GROUPID
I         was later changed using a SET command.
N
I      5. Use a default subsystem ID of DSN.
N
I      You cannot specify both DB2GROUPID and DB2ID - if you attempt to
I      specify both on the same CEDA panel, the DB2ID is used. If a
I      DB2GROUPID is specified in a CEMT or EXEC CICS SET DB2CONN command,
I      this overrides any DB2ID that is set in the installed DB2CONN
I      definition, and the DB2ID is blanked out.
N
D    MSGQUEUE1(CDB2 | tdqueue)
I      Specifies the first transient data
I      destination to which unsolicited messages from the CICS DB2
I      attachment facility are sent. This first destination cannot be
I      blank.
N
D    MSGQUEUE2(tdqueue)
I      Specifies a second transient data destination to
I      which unsolicited messages from the CICS DB2 attachment facility
I      are sent.
N
D    MSGQUEUE3(tdqueue)
I      Specifies a third transient data destination to
I      which unsolicited messages from the CICS DB2 attachment facility
I      are sent.
N
D    NONTERMREL(YES | NO)
I      Specifies whether a non-terminal transaction
I      releases threads for reuse at intermediate sync points.
N
I      NO: Non-terminal transactions do not release threads for reuse at
I        intermediate sync points.
N
I      YES: Non-terminal transactions release threads for reuse at
I        intermediate sync points.
N
D    PURGECYCLE(00,30 | mm,ss)
I      Specifies the duration, in minutes and
I      seconds, of the purge cycle for protected threads. The duration of
I      the purge cycle is in the range 5 seconds to 59 minutes 59 seconds.
I      If you do not specify a value for PURGECYLE, it defaults to 30
I      seconds; PURGECYCLE= 00, 30.
N
I      A protected thread is not terminated immediately when it is
I      released. It is terminated only after two completed purge cycles,
I      if it has not been reused in the meantime. Therefore, if the purge
I      cycle is set to 30 seconds, a protected thread is purged 30 - 60
I      seconds after it is released. The first purge cycle after the
I      attachment facility starts is always 5 minutes. After that the
I      purge cycle values are applied. An unprotected thread is terminated
I      when it is released (at sync point or end of task) if there are no
I      other transactions waiting for a thread on that DB2ENTRY. Only
I      threads belonging to a DB2ENTRY can be protected. Pool threads and
I      command threads cannot be protected.
N
D    RESYNCMEMBER(YES | NO)
I      If you are using group attach, use the
I      RESYNCMEMBER attribute to select the strategy that CICS adopts if
I      outstanding units of work are being held for the last DB2 data
I      sharing group member to which CICS was connected.
N
I      YES: Indicates that if outstanding units of work are held, you
I        require resynchronization with the last DB2 data sharing group
I        member to which CICS was connected. CICS ignores the group
I        attach facility, and the CICS-DB2 attachment facility waits
I        until it can reconnect to that last connected DB2 data sharing
I        group member, to resolve the indoubt units of work. Units of work
I        which are shunted indoubt are not included in this process,
I        because CICS itself is unable to resolve those units of work at
I        this time. Resynchronization for those UOWs occurs when CICS has
I        resynchronized with its remote coordinator.
N
I      NO: Indicates that you do not require resynchronization. CICS makes
I        one attempt to reconnect to the last connected DB2 data sharing
I        group member. If this attempt is successful, the indoubt units of
I        work (except for UOWs that are shunted indoubt) can be resolved.
I        If it is unsuccessful, then CICS uses group attach to connect to
I        any active member of the DB2 data sharing group, and a warning
I        message (DFHDB2064) is issued stating that there can be
I        unresolved indoubt units of work with the last member of the
I        group to which CICS was connected.
N
D    REUSELIMIT(1000 | value)
I      Specifies a value in the range 0 - 10000
I      representing the maximum number of times a thread can be reused
I      before it is terminated. The default is 1000. A value of 0 means
I      that there is no limit on the number of times that a thread can be
I      reused; this was the situation before CICS TS 4.2. However,
I      long-running CICS DB2 threads that are constantly being reused
I      build up resources in DB2 that can cause storage problems leading
I      to abends and DB2 subsystem outages.
N
I      The reuse limit applies to unprotected threads both in the pool and
I      on a DB2ENTRY, and to protected DB2ENTRY threads. An unprotected
I      thread is reused if, at the time it is released from a transaction,
I      there is a new transaction waiting. A protected thread is reused if
I      a new transaction requires a thread during the time the thread is
I      protected from being terminated. In either case, when the reuse
I      limit is reached no further transactions can use the thread. When
I      the transaction that is currently using the thread releases it,
I      CICS terminates and re-creates the thread to free up DB2 resources
I      before determining if there is new work for the thread to do, or
I      whether the thread is to be protected.
N
I      Using the default of 1000 provides sufficient protection against
I      over-allocating thread storage and EDM pool storage below the 2 GB
I      bar when you are using a DB2 bind option of RELEASE(DEALLOCATE)
I      without adversely affecting performance. If, however, DB2
I      monitoring and statistics show excessive DB2 thread storage,
I      excessive EDM pool storage usage, or both, this limit can be
I      lowered. Conversely, if CICS-DB2 statistics show that pool or
I      entry threads are hitting the reuse limit frequently and there is
I      sufficient virtual and real storage available to allow more DB2
I      thread storage, this limit can be raised.
N
I      Setting a low value for the reuse limit has a performance impact
I      in terms of an increase in processor activity and a decrease in
I      throughput. However, there are situations where you might choose
I      to set a low value. For example, if you wanted to evaluate changing
I      DB2 bind options from RELEASE(COMMIT) to RELEASE(DEALLOCATE) for a
I      plan or package, you might use a low value temporarily to test the
I      scenario.
N
D    SIGNID(name)
I      Specifies the authorization ID to be used by the
I      CICS DB2 attachment facility when signing on to DB2 for pool and
I      DB2ENTRY threads that specify AUTHTYPE(SIGN). The default is blanks
I      which are replaced by the applid of the CICS system when the
I      DB2CONN is installed. The ID that you specify can be up to eight
I      characters in length.
N
I      If you specify a user ID on the SIGNID attribute, CICS performs a
I      surrogate user check against the user ID that is performing the
I      installation. Similarly, the CICS region user ID is subject to a
I      surrogate user check during group list installation on a CICS cold
I      or initial start.
N
I      If the ID you specify matches the CICS region user ID, and you
I      specify AUTHTYPE(SIGN) for any command, pool, or entry threads, the
I      RACF access control environment element (ACEE) for the CICS region
I      user ID is passed to DB2.
N
D    STANDBYMODE(RECONNECT | NOCONNECT | CONNECT)
I      Specifies the action to
I      be taken by the CICS DB2 attachment facility if DB2 is not active
I      when an attempt is made to connect CICS to DB2.
N
I      CONNECT: Specifies that the CICS DB2 attachment facility is to
I      wait in 'standbymode' for DB2 to become active. If the connection
I      is made, and DB2 later fails, the CICS DB2 attachment facility
I      terminates.
N
I      NOCONNECT: Specifies that the CICS DB2 attachment facility is to
I        terminate.
N
I      RECONNECT: Specifies that the CICS DB2 attachment facility is to
I        go into 'standby mode' and wait for DB2. If DB2 later fails
I        after the connection is made, the CICS DB2 attachment facility
I        reverts to 'standby mode', and CICS then reconnects to DB2 when
I        DB2 recovers.
N
D    STATSQUEUE(CDB2 | tdqueue)
I      Specifies the transient data destination
I      for CICS DB2 attachment facility statistics produced when the CICS
I      DB2 attachment facility is shut down.
N
D    TCBLIMIT(12 | value)
I      Specifies the maximum number of TCBs that can
I      be used to process DB2 requests. The default is 12. The minimum
I      number is 4 and the maximum is 2000. CICS uses L8 and L9 mode open
I      TCBs to process DB2 requests. The TCBLIMIT attribute of the DB2CONN
I      definition governs how many of the open TCBs can be used to access
I      DB2, that is, how many of them can identify to DB2 and create a
I      connection into DB2.
N
I      For more information about TCB limits and open TCB modes, see
I      Open TCB management in Improving performance.
N
N      The TCBLIMIT value controls the total number of threads for the
I      CICS region.
N
I      For this reason, the recommended value for TCBLIMIT is the sum of
I      all the thread limit values (that is, the sum of all THREADLIMIT
I      attributes on the DB2 connection and DB2 entry resource
I      definitions, plus the COMTHREADLIMIT value on the DB2 connection
I      definition) up to the limit of 2000.
N
I      If the limit set automatically by CICS for the number of L8 and L9
I      mode open TCBs is reached, so no more open TCBs can be created, the
I      task is suspended with HTYPE(DISPATCH) and HVALUE(OPEN_TCB). CICS
I      sets this limit using the formula (2 * MXT value) + 32, with the
I      MXT or MAXTASKS limit for the CICS region. If this limit is not
I      exceeded but TCBLIMIT is exceeded, then the task is suspended with
I      HTYPE(CDB2CONN). In this situation, although CICS has an open TCB
I      available, the maximum allowed number of open TCBs are being used
I      to access DB2 (as defined in TCBLIMIT).
N
I      When determining the number for TCBLIMIT, you must consider the
I      amount you specified for the MAX USERS parameter on DB2
I      installation panel DSNTIPE.
N
D    THREADERROR(N906D | ABEND | N906)
I      Specifies the processing that is to
I      occur following a create thread error.
N
I      ABEND: When the first SQL error is detected, CICS takes a
I        transaction dump for abend code AD2S, AD2T, or AD2U, depending
I        on the type of error.
N
I        For the first error, the transaction does not abend. For a second
I        or subsequent SQL error, the transaction abends with abend code
I        AD2S, AD2T, or AD2U. The transaction must be terminated and
I        reinitialized before it is allowed to issue another SQL request.
N
I      N906D: A transaction dump is to be taken and the DSNCSQL RMI
I        associated with the transaction is not to be disabled. The
I        transaction receives a -906 SQLCODE if another SQL is issued,
I        unless the transaction issues SYNCPOINT ROLLBACK. SYNCPOINT
I        without the ROLLBACK option results in an ASP3 or ASP7 abend.
I        The transaction dump records an abend of AD2S, AD2T, or AD2U.
N
I      N906: The DSNCSQL RMI associated with the transaction is not to be
I        disabled. The transaction receives a -906 SQLCODE if another SQL
I        request is issued, unless the transaction issues a SYNCPOINT
I        ROLLBACK. SYNCPOINT without the ROLLBACK option results in an
I        ASP3 or ASP7 abend.
N
NPool thread attributes
N----------------------
NDescribes   the attributes of the DB2CONN resource that relate to the
Npool thread.
N
D    ACCOUNTREC(NONE | UOW | TASK | TXID)
I      Specifies the minimum amount of
I      DB2 accounting required for transactions that use pool threads.
I      The specified minimum might be exceeded, as described in the
I      following options.
N
I      NONE: No accounting records are required for transactions that
I        use pool threads.
N
I        DB2 produces at least one accounting record for each thread when
I        the thread is ended. Authorization changes additionally cause
I        accounting records to be produced.
N
I      TASK: The CICS DB2 attachment facility causes a minimum of one
I        accounting record for each CICS task to be produced.
N
I        A transaction that contains multiple units of work (UOWs), and
I        in which the threads are released at sync point, can use a
I        different thread for each of its UOWs. As a result, an accounting
I        record might be produced for each UOW.
N
I      TXID: The CICS DB2 attachment facility causes an accounting record
I        to be produced when the transid that uses the thread changes.
N
I        Because pool threads are typically used by a number of different
I        transaction IDs, there is an increased chance that a transaction
I        containing multiple UOWs, and in which the threads are released
I        at sync point, will use a different thread for each UOW. In this
I        case, an accounting record might be produced for each UOW.
N
I      UOW: The CICS DB2 attachment facility causes an accounting record
I        to be produced for each UOW, assuming that the thread is released
I        at the end of the UOW.
N
D    AUTHID(userid)
I      Specifies the user ID that is used for security
I      checking when using pool threads.
N
I      Do not specify AUTHID if you are using RACF for some or all of the
I      security checking in your DB2 address space; use AUTHTYPE instead,
I      with the GROUP, SIGN, or USERID options. You must use AUTHTYPE
I      because threads that use an AUTHID do not pass the required RACF
I      access control environment element (ACEE) to DB2. The ID that you
I      specify can be up to 8 characters in length.
N
D    AUTHTYPE(USERID | GROUP | SIGN | TERM | TX | OPID)
I      Specifies the type of ID
I      that can be used for threads on this DB2ENTRY.
N
I      If you are using RACF for some or all of the security checking in
I      your DB2 address space, use the GROUP, SIGN, or USERID options. You
I      must use one of these options because only threads defined with
I      these options pass the required RACF access control environment
I      element (ACEE) to DB2. However, if you specify the SIGN option,
I      the ACEE is passed to DB2 only if the value specified for the
I      SIGNID attribute on the DB2CONN definition matches the CICS region
I      user ID.
N
I      The ACEE is not required if you are using DB2 internal security
I      only; so, in this case, you can use any of the options.
N
I      USERID: The user ID associated with the CICS transaction is used
I        as the authorization ID. If the user ID is less than 8 characters
I        in length, it is padded on the right with blanks.
N
I        Important: Do not specify AUTHTYPE(USERID) when you use the DB2
I        sample sign-on exit DSN@SGN, because it might result in an SQL
I        -922 failure. Specify COMMAUTHTYPE(GROUP) instead.
N
I      OPID: The operator identification that is associated with the
I        user ID that is associated with the CICS transaction is used as
I        the authorization ID.
N
I        The 3-character operator identification is padded on the right
I        with blanks to form the 8-character authorization ID.
N
I      GROUP: Specifies the user ID and the connected group name as the
I        authorization ID. The following table shows how these two values
I        are interpreted by DB2.
N
I        To use the GROUP option, you must specify SEC=YES in the system
I        initialization parameters for the region.
N
I        If no RACF group ID is available for this USERID, an 8-character
I        field of blanks is passed to DB2 as the group ID.
N
I      SIGN: Specifies that the SIGNID attribute of the DB2 connection
I        definition is to be used as the resource authorization ID.
N
I      TERM: Specifies the terminal identification as an authorization ID.
I        The 4-character terminal identification is padded on the right
I        with blanks to form the 8-character authorization ID.
N
I        If the transaction is not associated with a terminal (for
I        example, if it is initiated with a START command), do not specify
I        AUTHTYPE(TERM).
N
I      TX: Specifies the transaction identification as the authorization
I        ID. The 4-character transaction identification is padded on
N
D    DROLLBACK(YES | NO)
I      Specifies whether the CICS DB2 attachment
I      facility initiates a SYNCPOINT ROLLBACK if a transaction that is
I      involved in a deadlock resolution is selected.
N
I      YES: The attachment facility initiates a SYNCPOINT ROLLBACK before
I        returning control to the application. An SQL return code of -911
I        is returned to the program.
N
I        Do not specify YES if the pool is used by transactions running
I        enterprise beans as part of an OTS transaction; SYNCPOINT
I        ROLLBACK is not allowed in an OTS transaction. Consider defining
I        a DB2ENTRY that specifies DROLLBACK(NO) for use by transactions
I        which run enterprise beans as part of an OTS transaction.
N
I      NO: The attachment facility does not initiate a rollback for a
I        transaction. An SQL return code of -913 is returned to the
I        application.
N
D    PLAN(plan)
I      Specifies the name of the plan to be used for all pool
I      threads.
N
D    PLANEXITNAME(DSNCUEXT | exit)
I      Specifies the name of the dynamic
I      plan exit to be used for pool threads. If you change PLAN and
I      PLANEXITNAME while there are active transactions for the pool,
I      the next time the transaction releases the thread the new values
I      are applied.
N
D    PRIORITY(HIGH | EQUAL | LOW)
I      Specifies the priority of the pool
I      thread TCBs relative to the CICS main TCB (QR TCB). The thread TCBs
I      are CICS open L8 TCBs.
N
I      HIGH: Thread TCBs have a higher priority than the CICS QR TCB.
N
I      EQUAL: Thread TCBs have equal priority with the CICS QR TCB.
N
I      LOW: Thread TCBs have a lower priority than the CICS QR TCB.
N
D    THREADLIMIT(3 | value)
I      Specifies the current maximum number of pool
I      threads that the CICS DB2 attachment facility allows to be active
I      before requests are made to wait or are rejected, subject to the
I      THREADWAIT attribute. The default value of THREADLIMIT (3) is also
I      the minimum that you can specify. The maximum value must not be
I      greater than the value specified for TCBLIMIT.
N
D    THREADWAIT(YES | NO)
I      Specifies whether transactions wait for a pool
I      thread or end abnormally if the number of active pool threads
I      reaches the thread limit.
N
I      The CICS DB2 attachment issues a unique abend code AD3T, message
I      DFHDB2011, when you code THREADWAIT=NO and the number of pool
I      threads is exceeded.
N
I      YES: If all threads are busy, a transaction must wait until one
I        becomes available. A transaction can wait as long as CICS allows
I        it to wait, generally until a thread becomes available.
N
I      NO: If all threads are busy, the transaction ends abnormally with
I        code AD2T or AD3T.

NCommand   thread attributes
N-------------------------
NDescribes   the attributes of the DB2CONN resource that relate to the
Ncommand   thread.
N
NThe   DB2 connection definition command thread attribute descriptions
Nare:
N
D    COMAUTHID(userid)
I      Specifies what id the CICS DB2 attachment facility
I      should use for security checking when using command threads.
N
I      Do not use COMAUTHID if you are using RACF for some or all of the
I      security checking in your DB2 address space; use COMAUTHTYPE
I      instead, with the USERID or GROUP option. You can also use
I      COMMAUTHTYPE with the SIGN option when the SIGNID attribute on the
I      DB2CONN definition matches the CICS region user ID. This is because
I      threads using a COMAUTHID do not pass the required RACF access
I      control environment element (ACEE) to DB2. The ACEE is not required
I      if you are only using DB2 internal security, so in this case, you
I      can use COMAUTHID.The ID that you specify can be up to eight
I      characters in length.
N
D    COMAUTHTYPE(USERID | GROUP | SIGN | TERM | TX | OPID)
I      Specifies the type of
I      id that can be used for security checking when using command
I      threads.
N
I      If you are using RACF for some or all of the security checking in
I      your DB2 address space, use the GROUP, SIGN or USERID options. This
I      is because only threads defined with these options pass the
I      required RACF access control environment element (ACEE) to DB2.
I      However, if you specify the SIGN option, the ACEE is passed to DB2
I      only if the value specified for the SIGNID attribute on the DB2CONN
I      definition matches the CICS region user ID.
N
I      USERID: The 1 to 8-character userid associated with the CICS
I        transaction is used as the authorization ID. The name can be up
I        to eight characters in length.
N
I        Important: Do not specify COMMAUTHTYPE(USERID) when you use the
I        DB2 sample sign-on exit DSN@SGN, as this may result in an SQL
I        -922 failure. Specify COMMAUTHTYPE(GROUP) instead.
N
I      OPID: The operator identification associated with the userid that
I        is associated with the CICS transaction sign-on facility is used
I        as the authorization ID (three characters padded to eight).
N
I      GROUP: Specifies the 1 to 8-character USERID and the connected
I        group name as the authorization ID. The following table shows
I        how these two values are interpreted by DB2.
N
I        To use the CGROUP option the CICS system must have SEC=YES
I        specified in the CICS system initialization table (SIT).
N
I        If no RACF group ID is available for this USERID, an 8-character
I        field of blanks is passed to DB2 as the group ID.
N
I      SIGN: Specifies that the SIGNID attribute of the DB2CONN is used
I        as the resource authorization ID.
N
I      TERM: Specifies the terminal identification (four characters
I        padded to eight) as an authorization ID. An authorization ID
I        cannot be obtained in this manner if a terminal is not connected
I        with the transaction.
N
I        If a transaction is started (using a CICS command) and has no
I        terminal associated with it, the COMAUTHTYPE(TERM) should not
I        be used.
N
I      TX: Specifies the transaction identification (four characters
I        padded to eight) as the authorization ID.
N
D    COMTHREADLIM(1 | value)
I      The number specifies the current maximum
I      number of command threads the CICS DB2 attachment facility allows
I      active before requests overflow to the pool.
