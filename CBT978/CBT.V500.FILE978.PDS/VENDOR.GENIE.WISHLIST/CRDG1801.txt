NChapter 18. LSRPOOL resources
N-----------------------------
NSyntax:
N-------
D  DEFINE
D    LSRPOOL(name)
I      Specifies the name of the local shared resource pool
I      being defined. The name can be up to 8 characters in length.
N
I      If only DATA BUFFERS is specified, one set of buffers is built for
I      the pool to be used for both the index and the data components of
I      a VSAM KSDS data set.
N
I      If no data buffers are specified, CICS calculates the buffers
I      required for both data and index components, both components
I      sharing the same set of buffers. If INDEX BUFFERS is specified,
I      two parts of the pool are built, one for data and the other for
I      index buffers. If you specify INDEX BUFFERS, you must also specify
I      DATA BUFFERS.
N
D    GROUP(groupname)
I      Every resource definition must have a GROUP name.
I      The resource definition becomes a member of the group and is
I      installed in the CICS system when the group is installed.
N
I      The GROUP name can be up to 8 characters in length. Lowercase
I      characters are treated as uppercase characters.
N
D    DESCRIPTION(text)
I      You can provide a description of the resource that
I      you are defining in this field. The description text can be up to
I      58 characters in length. No restrictions apply to the characters
I      that you can use. However, if you use parentheses, ensure that for
I      each left parenthesis there is a matching right parenthesis. If you
I      use the CREATE command, for each single apostrophe in the text,
I      code two apostrophes.
N
I    LSRPOOLID({1|lsrpool}): This attribute is obsolete, but is supported
I      to provide compatibility with earlier releases of CICS.
N
I      The value specified for LSRPOOLID in existing definitions is
I      transferred to the new option LSRPOOLNUM.
N
D    LSRPOOLNUM(1 | number)
I      Specifies the identifier of the local shared
I      resource pool that is being defined.
N
I      The value must be in the range 1 through 255.
N
D    MAXKEYLENGTH(number)
I      Specifies the maximum key length of any of the
I      files that are to share resources. The value must be in the range
I      0 through 255. This value overrides part of the CICS resource
I      calculation. If you do not specify it, CICS determines the maximum
I      key length, recalculating it each time the LSR is rebuilt.
N
D    SHARELIMIT(number)
I      Specifies, as an integer, the percentage of the
I      maximum amount of VSAM resources to be allocated. The number can
I      be any value from 1 through 100.
N
I      Specify SHARELIMIT if CICS is to calculate the maximum amount of
I      resources required by the VSAM files that are to share resources.
I      Because these resources are to be shared, some percentage of this
I      maximum amount of resources must be allocated. If this attribute
I      is omitted, 50 percent of the maximum amount of resources is
I      allocated.
N
I      If both the STRINGS and SIZE attributes are specified, SHARELIMIT
I      has no effect.
N
D    STRINGS(number)
I      Specifies the limit, in the range 1 through 255,
I      of all the strings of the files in the pool. For more information,
I      see Number of buffers and strings for LSR and NSR pools in
I      Improving performance.
