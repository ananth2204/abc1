NChapter 6. Numbers and arithmetic
N---------------------------------
NDefinition
N----------
NArithmetic operation rules basic operators
N------------------------------------------
NThe basic operators (addition, subtraction, multiplication, and
Ndivision) operate on numbers as follows.
N
NAddition and Subtraction
N------------------------
NIf either number is 0, the other number, rounded to
NNUMERIC DIGITS digits, if necessary, is used as the result (with sign
Nadjustment as appropriate). Otherwise, the two numbers are extended on
Nthe right and left as necessary, up to a total maximum of DIGITS + 1
Ndigits (the number with the smaller absolute value may, therefore,
Nlose some or all of its digits on the right) and are then added or
Nsubtracted as appropriate.
N
N
NMultiplication
N--------------
NThe numbers are multiplied together ( long multiplication ) resulting
Nin a number that may be as long as the sum of the lengths of the two
Noperands.
N
N
NDivision
N--------
NFor the division: yyy / xxxxx the following steps are taken: First the
Nnumber yyy is extended with zeros on the right until it is larger than
Nthe number xxxxx (with note being taken of the change in the power of
Nten that this implies). Thus, in this example, yyy might become yyy00.
NTraditional long division then takes place.
