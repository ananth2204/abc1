NChapter 16. JVMSERVER resources
N-------------------------------
NSyntax:
N-------
D  DEFINE
D    JVMSERVER(name)
I      Specifies the 1 - 8 character name of the JVMSERVER
I      resource.
N
I      It is preferable not to use names that start with DFH because these
I      characters are reserved for use by CICS.
N
I      CICS can delete or discard them and replace them with CICS
I      resources when you upgrade or provide new function or fixes.
N
D    GROUP(groupname)
I      Every resource definition must have a GROUP name.
I      The resource definition becomes a member of the group and is
I      installed in the CICS system when the group is installed.
N
I      The GROUP name can be up to 8 characters in length. Lowercase
I      characters are treated as uppercase characters.
N
D    DESCRIPTION(text)
I      You can provide a description of the resource that
I      you are defining in this field. The description text can be up to
I      58 characters in length. No restrictions apply to the characters
I      that you can use. However, if you use parentheses, ensure that for
I      each left parenthesis there is a matching right parenthesis. If you
I      use the CREATE command, for each single apostrophe in the text,
I      code two apostrophes.
N
D    JVMPROFILE(jvmprofile)
I      Specifies the 1 - 8 character name of the
I      JVM profile containing the JVM options for running a JVM server.
I      The file containing the JVM profile must have a file extension of
I      .jvmprofile.
N
I      -> For a JVM profile for a JVMSERVER resource defined by online
I         resource definition, the file path is specified by the system
I         initialization parameter JVMPROFILEDIR.
N
I      -> For a JVM profile for a JVMSERVER resource that is defined in a
I         CICS bundle, the file path is relative to the root directory of
I         the CICS bundle. The file containing the JVM profile must be
I         packaged in the CICS bundle with the JVMSERVER resource. For
I         more information, see "Referencing zFS artifacts in a bundle".
N
I      The JVM profile name cannot consist of a single or double period.
I      The set of acceptable characters in the JVM profile name is more
I      restricted when the JVMSERVER resource is defined in a CICS bundle
I      using CICS Explorer.
N
D    LERUNOPTS(DFHAXRO | program)
I      Specifies the 1 - 8 character name of
I      the program that defines the runtime options for the Language
I      Environment enclave. DFHAXRO is a supplied program that provides
I      a set of default values. The source for DFHAXRO is in the
I      hlq.SDFHSAMP library if you want to change the defaults for any
I      of the Language Environment runtime options.
N
I      If you want to use a different program, put the program in the
I      hlq.SDFHLOAD library and specify the program name in uppercase
I      characters.
N
D    THREADLIMIT(number)
I      Specifies the maximum number of threads
I      that are allowed in the Language Environment enclave for the JVM
I      server. Each thread runs under a T8 TCB.
N
I      You can specify a limit in the range of 1 - 256 threads.
N
I      If you specify a thread limit that exceeds the maximum of 2000
I      threads that is allowed for the CICS region, taking into account
I      all other enabled and disabled JVMSERVER resources, CICS allocates
I      the remaining threads up to 2000 to the resource as the thread
I      limit value. If CICS is already at the maximum number of
I      JVMSERVER threads, the resource installs in a disabled state.
N
D    STATUS(ENABLED | DISABLED)
I      Specifies the initial status of the
I      JVMSERVER resource when it is installed.
N
I      ENABLED: The JVM server runtime environment is available for use.
N
I      DISABLED: The JVM server runtime environment is not available for
I        use.
* End of WISH.
