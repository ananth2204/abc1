NBuilt-in functions
N------------------
NDELSTR
N-------
NDELSTR returns string after deleting the substring that begins at the
Nnth character and is of length characters. If you omit length, or if
Nlength is greater than the number of characters from n to the end of
Nstring, the function deletes the rest of string (including the nth
Ncharacter). The length must be a positive whole number or zero. The n
Nmust be a positive whole number. If n is greater than the length of
Nstring, the function returns string unchanged.

NSyntax:
D  DELSTR(string,n,length)
I    string: What you want to act upon.
N
I    n: The starting position.
N
I    length: How much to delete. Omit this and it truncates to the end.

NExample
N-------
I  del_string = " has"
I  del_length = Length(del_string)
I  old_sentence = "This sentence has had an error in it."
I  del_position = Pos(del_string,old_sentence)
I  If (del_position > 0) Then do
I    new_sentence = DelStr(old_sentence,del_position,del_length)
I    Say old_sentence
I    Say new_sentence
I    say "Without a length it chops out the end."
I    new_sentence = DelStr(old_sentence,del_position)
I    Say old_sentence
I    Say new_sentence
I  End
* End of WISH.
