N-------------------------
NCommonly used single job step command sequences
N-----------------------------------------------
NA sequence of commands commonly used in a single job step includes
NDELETE-DEFINE-REPRO or DELETE-DEFINE-BLDINDEX.
N
N-> You can specify either a data definition (DD) name or a data set
N   name with these commands.
N
N-> When you refer to a DD name, allocation occurs at job step
N   initiation. The allocation can result in a job failure, if a
N   command such as REPRO follows a DELETE-DEFINE sequence that
N   changes the location (volser) of the data set. (Such failures can
N   occur with either SMS-managed data sets or non-SMS-managed data
N   sets.)
