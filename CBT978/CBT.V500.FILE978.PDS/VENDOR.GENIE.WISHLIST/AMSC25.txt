NAccess Method Services for Catalogs
N-----------------------------------
NChapter 25. IMPORT
N------------------
NThe IMPORT command moves or restores a cluster or alternate index, or
Nrestores a catalog.
N
NRestrictions:
N-------------
N-> The original version of the catalog is always deleted when you use
N   IMPORT.
N
N-> You can export a KSDS with extended addressability to a system that
N   does not support extended addressability if the data set is smaller
N   than 4GB. If it is larger, the EXPORT and IMPORT commands appear to
N   complete successfully, but when the data set tries to extend beyond
N   4GB, a message is issued. You can use REPRO specifically FROMKEY and
N   TOKEY, or COUNT parameters to reduce the size of the data set to
N   less than 4GB before using IMPORT.
N
N-> VSAM record-level sharing (RLS) information is lost when the IMPORT
N   is done on a DFSMS/MVS 1.2 or lower system. For the correct
N   procedure to use when copying or moving data sets with pending
N   recovery, see "Using VSAM Record-Level Sharing" in z/OS DFSMS Using
N   Data Sets and CICS Recovery and Restart Guide .
N
N-> Access Method Services does not use RLS. If an RLS keyword is
N   specified on the DD statement of a file to be opened by AMS, the
N   keyword will be ignored and the file will be opened and accessed in
N   non-RLS mode.
N
N-> The CATALOG parameter will not be honored when you use IMPORT to
N   restore a catalog. You can only import a catalog under the master
N   catalog.
