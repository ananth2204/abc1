NExample 11: Build a New Character Arrangement Table Module from an
NExisting Copy
N------------------------------------------------------------------
N3800 Model 3
N
NIn this example, an existing character arrangement table module is
Ncopied and used as a basis for a new module. The new character
Narrangement table is identical to the old one, except that it uses the
NGothic 15-pitch character set instead of Gothic 10-pitch.

D//CHARMOD2 JOB ...
D//ST01#01 EXEC PGM=IEBIMAGE
D//SYSUT1    DD DISP=(OLD),DSN=SYS1.IMAGELIB
D//SYSPRINT  DD SYSOUT=*
D//SYSIN     DD *
D         INCLUDE A11
D         OPTION  DEVICE=3800M3
D         TABLE   CGMID=87
D         NAME    A115
D/*
N
NThe control statements are discussed below:
N
N  The SYSUT1 DD statement includes DISP=OLD to ensure that no other
N  job can modify the data set while this job is executing.
N
N  The INCLUDE statement specifies that a copy of the character
N  arrangement table named A11 is to be used as a basis for the new
N  module. The A11 character arrangement table translates 8-bit data
N  codes to printable characters in the Gothic 10-pitch character set.
N
N  The OPTION statement with the DEVICE parameter specifies 3800 Model
N  3 compatibility mode processing.
N
N  The TABLE statement specifies a new character set identifier, X'87',
N  which is the identifier for the Gothic 15-pitch character set. No
N  other changes are made to the character arrangement table. The new
N  table calls for characters in the Gothic 15-pitch character set.
N
N  The name of the new character arrangement table is A115; it is
N  stored as a member of the SYS1.IMAGELIB data set.
