N-----------------------------------
NChapter 4. ALLOCATE
N-------------------
NAccess method services identifies the verb name ALLOCATE and attaches
Nthe terminal monitor program (TMP) that runs Time Sharing Option (TSO)
Ncommands in the background. The ALLOCATE command should be used only
Nto allocate new data sets to the job step. If you use ALLOCATE through
Naccess method services for anything else (the handling of SYSOUT data
Nsets, for example), you can get unpredictable results. Refer to
Nz/OS TSO/E Programming Guide for additional information on using this
Ncommand.
