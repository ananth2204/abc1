NChapter 24. PROCESSTYPE resources
N---------------------------------
NA PROCESSTYPE resource defines a BTS process-type. It names the CICS
Nfile which relates to the physical VSAM data set (repository) on which
Ndetails of all processes of this type (and their activity instances)
Nare to be stored.
N
NUsing the CICS business transaction services (BTS) API, you can define
Nand execute complex business applications called processes. A process
Nis represented in memory as a block of storage containing information
Nrelevant to its execution. It also has associated with it at least one
Nadditional block of information called an activity instance. When not
Nexecuting under the control of the CICS business transaction services
Ndomain, a process and its activity instances are written to a data set
Ncalled a repository.
N
NYou can categorize your BTS processes by assigning them to different
Nprocess-types. This is useful, for example, for browsing purposes. The
Nactivities that constitute a process are of the same process-type as
Nthe process itself.
N
NNote: Records for multiple process-types can be written to the same
Nrepository data set.
