NChapter 6. Numbers and arithmetic
N---------------------------------
NDefinition
N----------
NA precise definition of the arithmetic facilities of the REXX
Nlanguage is given here.
N
N
NNumbers
N-------
NA number in REXX is a character string that includes one or more
Ndecimal digits, with an optional decimal point. See "Exponential
Nnotation" for an extension of this definition.) The decimal point may
Nbe embedded in the number, or may be a prefix or suffix. The group of
Ndigits (and optional decimal point) constructed this way can have
Nleading or trailing blanks and an optional sign (+ or -) that must
Ncome before any digits or decimal point. The sign can also have
Nleading or trailing blanks.
N
NTherefore, number is defined as:
N
D  blanks sign blanks digits | digits. | digits.digits | .digits blanks
N
I    blanks: are one or more spaces
N
I    sign: is either + or -
N
I    digits: are one or more of the decimal digits 0-9.
N
NNote that a single period alone is not a valid number.
N
N
NPrecision
N---------
NPrecision is the maximum number of significant digits that can result
Nfrom an operation. This is controlled by the instruction:
N
I  NUMERIC DIGITS expression
N
I    expression: is evaluated and must result in a positive whole
I                number. This defines the precision (number of
I                significant digits) to which calculations are carried
I                out. Results are rounded to that precision, if
I                necessary.
N
I                If you do not specify expression in this instruction,
I                or if no NUMERIC DIGITS instruction has been processed
I                since the start of a program, the default precision is
I                used. The REXX standard for the default precision is 9.
