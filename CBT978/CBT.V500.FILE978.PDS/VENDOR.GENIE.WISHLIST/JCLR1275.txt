NDD Statement
N============
NUNIT Parameter
N--------------
NUse the UNIT parameter to ask the system to place the data set on:
N
N->A specific device.
N
N->A certain type or group of devices.
N
N->The same device as another data set.
N
NThe UNIT parameter can also tell the system how many devices to assign
Nand request that the system defer mounting the volume until the data
Nset is opened.
I
IInstallation defined names map to physical devices.
ICheck your standards.
N
D//             UNIT=AFF=ddname
I                 AFF=name: affinity to same device for ddname.
D//             UNIT= ({/dddd|name} {,unit-count|P}{,DEFER}{,SMSHONOR})
I                 /dddd: 3-digit or 4-digit hexadecimal number
I                  / required before 4-digit number and optional
I                    before 3-digit number.
I                 name: hardware name,group-name, or installation name.
I                   3390 is a hardware name.
I                   SYSALLDA is an IBM assigned group-name.
I                   PRODVSAM would be an installation name.
I                 unit-count: 1 - 59
I                             P: allocate same number of devices as
I                                volumes for parallel mount.
I                 DEFER: defers mounting until open
I                 SMSHONOR: for SMS tape library request.
N
NExample 1: Multiple tape drives.
N--------------------------------
N->DD statement DDX requests two 3480 tape devices,
N->DD statement DDY requests one 3480 tape device and defer
N  the mount until/if the data set is opened.
N->DD statement DDZ requests the same two devices as DDX.
I  Note that the operator will have to change volumes
I  on the two 3480 devices during execution of the job step.
M
MA greedy way to hold onto 2 devices while at the same time
Mconsiderately not requiring all 4 at the same time.

NExample 7: Tape Library Requests.
N---------------------------------
NDD01: To allocate to this Tape Library Request, the DD statement
N      UNIT=(/B5B8,,,SMSHONOR) requires
N      ->to use the device number B5B8,
N        ->which is in the list of devices selected by SMS.
N
NDD02: For this Tape Library Request, the DD statement
N      UNIT=(MYTAPE,,DEFER,SMSHONOR) requires the following devices:
N      ->the devices that are in the esoteric MYTAPE,
N      ->the devices that are in the list selected by SMS.
N
D//ST01#01 EXEC ......
D//DD01      DD DISP=SHR,DSN=A,
D//             UNIT=(/B5B8,,,SMSHONOR)
D//DD02      DD DSN=B,DISP=SHR,
D//             UNIT=(MYTAPE,,DEFER,SMSHONOR)
