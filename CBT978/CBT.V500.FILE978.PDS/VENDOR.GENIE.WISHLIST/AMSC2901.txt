NSyntax for PRINT Parameters
N---------------------------
D  PRINT -
N
NRequired Parameters
N-------------------
D    INFILE(ddname) | /* Abbreviation: IFILE */ -
D    INDATASET(entryname) /* Abbreviation: IDS */ -
I      identifies the data set or component to be printed. If the
I      logical record length of a non-VSAM source data set is greater
I      than 32,760 bytes, your PRINT command ends with an error message.
N
I      INFILE(ddname) /* Abbreviation: IFILE */: specifies the name of
I        the DD statement that identifies the data set or component to
I        be printed. You can list a base cluster in alternate-key
I        sequence by specifying a path name as the data set name in the
I        DD statement.
N
I      INDATASET(entryname) /* Abbreviation: IDS */: specifies the name
I        of the data set or component to be printed. If INDATASET is
I        specified, the entryname is dynamically allocated.
N
I        You can list a base cluster in alternate-key sequence by
I        specifying a path name as entryname.
N
I        If you are printing a member of a non-VSAM partitioned data
I        set, the entryname must be specified in the format:
N
I          pdsname(membername)
N
NOptional Parameters
N-------------------
D    CHARACTER | /* Abbreviation: CHAR */ -
D    DUMP | -
D    HEX -
I      specifies the format of the listing.
N
I      For the CHARACTER and DUMP parameters, setting the GRAPHICS
I      parameter of the PARM command determines which bit patterns
I      print as characters. Search "PARM Command" for more information.
N
I      Note: When you print non-VSAM variable length records, the
I      4-byte record descriptor word (RDW) that appears at the beginning
I      of each record is not printed.
N
I      CHARACTER /* Abbreviation: CHAR */: specifies that each byte in
I        the logical record is to be printed as a character. Bit
I        patterns not defining a character are printed as periods. Key
I        fields are listed in character format. CHARACTER must be
I        specified if data contains DBCS characters. DUMP and HEX cannot
I        be specified with DBCS.
N
I      DUMP: specifies that each byte in the logical record is to be
I        printed in both hexadecimal and character format. In the
I        character portion of the listing, bit patterns not defining a
I        character are printed as periods. Key fields are listed in
I        hexadecimal format.
N
I      HEX: specifies that each byte in the logical record is to be
I        printed as two hexadecimal digits. Key fields are listed in
I        hexadecimal format.
N
D    DBCS -
I      specifies that the data to be printed includes DBCS characters.
I      Bytes from the logical record are printed in their respective
I      characters (that is, SBCS or DBCS format). Bit patterns not
I      defining a character are printed as periods. When DBCS is
I      specified, PRINT checks during printing to ensure that the DBCS
I      data meets DBCS criteria unless SKIPDBCSCHECK or NODBCSCHECK is
I      also specified. For more information on DBCS support, see
I      z/OS DFSMS Using Data Sets.
N
D    FROMKEY(key) | /* Abbreviation: FKEY */ -
D    FROMADDRESS(address) | /* Abbreviation: FADDR */ -
D    FROMNUMBER(number) | /* Abbreviation: FNUM */ -
D    SKIP(number) -
I      locates the data set being listed where listing is to start. If
I      you do not specify a value, the listing begins with the first
I      logical record in the data set or component.
N
I      The only value that can be specified for a SAM data set is SKIP.
N
I      Use FROMADDRESS and TOADDRESS to specify a partial print range
I      for a linear data set cluster. If required, printing is rounded
I      up to 4096-byte boundaries.
N
I      The starting delimiter must be consistent with the ending
I      delimiter. For example, if FROMADDRESS is specified for the
I      starting location, use TOADDRESS to specify the ending location.
I      The same is true for FROMKEY and TOKEY, and FROMNUMBER and
I      TONUMBER.
N
I      FROMKEY(key) /* Abbreviation: FKEY */: specifies the key of the
I        first record you want listed. You can specify generic keys
I        (that is, a portion of the key followed by *). If you specify
I        generic keys, listing begins at the first record with a key
I        matching that portion of the key you specified.
N
I        You cannot specify a key longer than that defined for the data
I        set. If you do, the listing is not done. If the specified key
I        is not found, the next higher key is used as the starting
I        point for the listing.
N
I        FROMKEY can be specified only when an alternate index, a
I        key-sequenced VSAM data set, a catalog, or an indexed
I        sequential (ISAM) non-VSAM data set is being printed.
N
I          key: can contain 1 to 255 EBCDIC characters. A key ending in
I            X'5C' is processed as a generic key.
N
I      FROMADDRESS(address) /* Abbreviation: FADDR */: specifies the
I        relative byte address (RBA) of the first record you want
I        printed. The RBA value must be the beginning of a logical
I        record. If you specify this parameter for a key-sequenced data
I        set, the listing is in physical sequential order instead of in
I        logical sequential order.
N
I        FROMADDRESS can be specified only for VSAM key-sequenced,
I        linear, or entry-sequenced data sets or components. FROMADDRESS
I        cannot be specified when the data set is accessed through a
I        path or for a key-sequenced data set with spanned records if
I        any of those spanned records are to be accessed.
N
I          address: Can be specified in decimal (n) or hexadecimal
I            (X'n'). The specification cannot be longer than one
I            fullword when specified in decimal.
N
I            The largest address you can specify in decimal is
I            4,294,967,295. If a higher value is required, specify it
I            in hexadecimal.
N
I      FROMNUMBER(number) /* Abbreviation: FNUM */:  specifies the
I        relative record number of the first record you want printed.
I        FROMNUMBER can only be specified for VSAM relative record data
I        sets.
N
I          number: Can be specified in decimal (n), hexadecimal (X'n'),
I            or binary (B'n'). The specification cannot be longer than
I            one fullword.
N
I            The largest address you can specify in decimal is
I            4,294,967,295. If a higher value is required, specify it in
I            hexadecimal.
N
I      SKIP(number): specifies the number of logical records you want
I        to skip before the listing of records begins. For example, if
I        you want the listing to begin with record number 500, you
I        specify SKIP(499). SKIP should not be specified when you are
I        accessing the data set through a path; the results are
I        unpredictable.
N
D    INSERTSHIFT((offset1 offset2) ...) | /* Abbreviation: ISHFT */ -
D    INSERTALL /* Abbreviation: ISALL */ -
I      If DBCS is specified without INSERTSHIFT nor INSERTALL, the
I      logical record is assumed to already contain SO and SI
I      characters. PRINT will check during printing to ensure that the
I      DBCS data meets DBCS criteria.
N
I      INSERTSHIFT((offset1 offset2) ...) /* Abbreviation: ISHFT */:
I        indicates that SO and SI characters are to be inserted in the
I        logical record during PRINT command processing. This action
I        has no effect on the data set referenced by PRINT. This keyword
I        cannot be specified unless DBCS is also specified.
N
I        offset1: Indicates the byte offset in the logical record to be
I          printed before which a SO character is to be inserted.
N
I        offset2: Indicates the byte offset in the logical record to be
I          printed after which an SI character is to be inserted.
I          offset2 must be greater than offset1 and the difference must
I          be an even number.
N
I          Offset pairs cannot overlap ranges.
N
I        The maximum number of offset pairs that can be specified is
I        255.
N
I      INSERTALL /* Abbreviation: ISALL */: indicates the logical
I        record is assumed to contain only DBCS characters. An SO
I        character is inserted at the beginning of the record and an
I        SI character is inserted at the end of the record.
N
D    OUTFILE(ddname) /* Abbreviation: OFILE */ -
I      identifies a target data set other than SYSPRINT. For ddname,
I      substitute the name of the JCL statement that identifies the
I      alternate target data set.
N
I      The access method services target data set for listings,
I      identified by the ddname SYSPRINT, is the default. The target
I      data set must meet the requirements stated in "JCL DD Statement
I      for a Target Data Set".
N
D    SKIPDBCSCHECK((offset1 offset2))...) | /* Abbreviation: SKDCK */ -
D    NODBCSCHECK /* Abbreviation: NODCK */ -
I      SKIPDBCSCHECK((offset1 offset2)...) /* Abbreviation: SKDCK */:
I        indicates that characters between offset1 and offset2 are not
I        to be checked for DBCS criteria during PRINT command
I        processing. This keyword cannot be specified unless DBCS is
I        also specified.
N
I        offset1: Indicates the byte offset in the logical record to be
I          printed at which checking is to cease until offset2 is
I          reached.
N
I        offset2: Indicates the byte offset in the logical record after
I          which checking is to resume. offset2 must be greater than
I          offset1.
N
I          Offset pairs cannot overlap ranges.
N
I        The maximum number of offset pairs that can be specified is
I        255.
N
I      NODBCSCHECK /* Abbreviation: NODCK */: specifies that DBCS
I        validity checking not be performed.
N
D    TOKEY(key) |
D    TOADDRESS(address) | /* Abbreviation: TADDR */
D    TONUMBER(number) |
D    COUNT(number)
I      locates the data set being listed where you want the listing to
I      stop. If you do not use this, the listing ends with the logical
I      end of the data set or component.
N
I      The only value that can be specified for a SAM data set is COUNT.
N
I      Use FROMADDRESS and TOADDRESS to specify a partial print range
I      for a linear data set cluster. The location where the listing is
I      to stop must follow the location where the listing is to begin.
N
I      The ending delimiter must be consistent with the starting
I      delimiter. For example, if FROMADDRESS is specified for the
I      starting location, use TOADDRESS to specify the ending location.
I      The same is true for FROMKEY and TOKEY, and FROMNUMBER and
I      TONUMBER.
N
I      TOKEY(key): specifies the key of the last record to be listed.
I        You can specify generic keys (that is, a portion of the key
I        followed by *). If you specify generic keys, listing stops
I        after the last record is listed whose key matches that portion
I        of the key you specified. If you specify a key longer than that
I        defined for the data set, the listing is not done.
N
I        If the specified key is not found, the next lower key is used
I        as the stopping point for the listing.
N
I        TOKEY can be specified only when an alternate index, a
I        key-sequenced VSAM data set, a catalog, or an indexed
I        sequential (ISAM) non-VSAM data set is being printed.
N
I          key: Can contain 1 to 255 EBCDIC characters. A key ending in
I            X'5C' is processed as a generic key.
N
I      TOADDRESS(address) /* Abbreviation: TADDR */: specifies the
I        relative byte address (RBA) of the last record you want listed.
N
I        Unlike FROMADDRESS, the RBA value does not need to be the
I        beginning of a logical record. The entire record containing the
I        specified RBA is printed. If you specify this parameter for a
I        key-sequenced data set, the listing is in physical sequential
I        order instead of in logical sequential order.
N
I        TOADDRESS can be specified only for VSAM key-sequenced, linear
I        or entry-sequenced data sets or components. TOADDRESS cannot
I        be specified when the data set is accessed through a path.
I        TOADDRESS cannot be specified for a key-sequenced data set with
I        spanned records if any of those spanned records are to be
I        accessed.
N
I        address: Can be specified in decimal (n) or hexadecimal (X'n').
I          The specification cannot be longer than one fullword when
I          specified in decimal.
N
I          The largest address you can specify in decimal is
I          4,294,967,295. If a higher value is required, specify it in
I          hexadecimal.
N
I      TONUMBER(number) /* Abbreviation: TNUM */: specifies the relative
I        record number of the last record you want printed. TONUMBER
I        can be specified only for a VSAM relative record data set.
N
I        number: Can be specified in decimal (n), hexadecimal (X'n'),
I          or binary (B'n').
N
I          The specification cannot be longer than one fullword.
N
I          The largest address you can specify in decimal is
I          4,294,967,295. If a higher value is required, specify it in
I          hexadecimal.
N
I      COUNT(number): specifies the number of logical records to be
I        listed. COUNT should not be specified when you are accessing
I        the data set through a path; the results are unpredictable.
N
I        number: can be specified in decimal (n), hexadecimal (X'n'),
I          or binary (B'n'); the specification cannot be longer than
I          one fullword.
N
I          The largest address you can specify in decimal is
I          4,294,967,295. If a higher value is required, specify it in
I          hexadecimal.
