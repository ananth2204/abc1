NChapter 4. Syntax of Parameters
N-------------------------------
NNotation Used to Show Syntax
N----------------------------
NThe syntax of the job control statements and of their parameters
Nappear in the chapters that describe the statements. These conventions
Napply fully to what you see in the manual and partially to what GENIE
N can show you on a 3270 display.
N
N-> Uppercase letters, words, and characters: Code uppercase letters,
N   words, and the following characters exactly as they appear in the
N   syntax.
N
N-> Lowercase letters, words, and symbols: Lowercase letters, words,
N   and symbols in the syntax represent variables. Substitute specific
N   information for them.
N
N-> | (vertical bar): A vertical bar indicates an exclusive OR. Never
N   code | on a control statement. It is used between choices within
N   braces or brackets; it indicates that you code only one of the
N   items within the braces or brackets.
N
N-> { } (braces): Braces surround required, related items and indicate
N   that you must code one of the enclosed items. Never code { or } on
N   a control statement.
N
N-> Ý ¨ (brackets): Brackets surround an optional item or items and
N   indicate that you can code one or none of the enclosed items.
N   Never code Ý or ¨ on a control statement.
N
N-> { , } or Ý , ¨: One of the items in braces or brackets can be a
N   comma. Code the comma when you do not code any of the other items
N   in the braces or brackets but you are coding a following part of
N   the parameter.
N
N-> __ (underline): An underline indicates the default that the system
N   uses when you do not code a subparameter.
N
N-> ... (ellipsis): An ellipsis follows an item that you can code more
N   than once. Never code ... on a control statement.
N
N-> .. (two consecutive periods): Two consecutive periods indicate
N   that a parameter consists of a symbolic parameter followed by a
N   period and then by other code, so that only part of the parameter
N   is variable.
