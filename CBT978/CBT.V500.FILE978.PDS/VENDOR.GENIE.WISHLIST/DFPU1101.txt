N----------------------------------------------
NExample 1: Place Two Procedures in SYS1.PROCLIB
N-----------------------------------------------
NIn this example, two procedures are to be placed in the cataloged
Nprocedure library, SYS1.PROCLIB. The example assumes that the two
Nprocedures can be accommodated within the space originally allocated to
Nthe procedure library.

NThe control statements are discussed below:
N
N  SYSUT1 and SYSUT2 DD define the SYS1.PROCLIB data set, which is
N  assumed to be cataloged.
N
N  SYSIN DD defines the control data set, which follows in the input
N  stream. The data set contains the utility control statements and the
N  data to be placed in the procedure library.
N
N  The ADD function statement indicates that records (data statements)
N  in the control data set are to be placed in the output. The newly
N  created procedure, ERASE, is listed in the message data set.
N
N  The ADD function will not take place if a member named ERASE already
N  exists in the new master data set referenced by SYSUT2.
N
N  The first NUMBER detail statement indicates that the new and
N  replacement procedures are to be assigned sequence numbers. The
N  first record of each procedure is assigned sequence number 10; the
N  next record is assigned sequence number 20, and so on.
N
N  The ERASE EXEC statement marks the beginning of the first new
N  procedure.
N
N  The REPL function statement indicates that records (data statements)
N  in the control data set are to replace an already existing member.
N  The member is stored in the new master data set referenced by
N  SYSUT2. The REPL function will only take place if a member named
N  LISTPROC already exists in the old master data set referenced by
N  SYSUT1.
N
N  The second NUMBER detail statement is a duplicate of the first.
N
N  The LIST EXEC statement marks the beginning of the second new
N  procedure.
N
N  The ENDUP statement marks the end of the SYSIN DD input data.
