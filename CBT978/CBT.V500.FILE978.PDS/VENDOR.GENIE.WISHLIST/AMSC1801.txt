NChapter 18. DEFINE PATH
N-----------------------
NSyntax for DEFINE PATH Parameters
N---------------------------------
D  DEFINE /* Abbreviation: DEF */ -
N
NRequired Parameters
N-------------------
D    PATH( -
I      specifies that a path is to be defined or that a path entry
I      is to be recataloged.
N
D      NAME(entryname) -
I        specifies the path's name.
N
D      PATHENTRY(entryname) /* Abbreviation: PENT */ -
I        when the path consists of an alternate index and its base
I        clusters, entryname identifies the alternate index entry.
I        When the path is opened to process data records, both the
I        alternate index and the base cluster are opened.
N
I        entryname: identifies the alternate index entry. When the path
I          is opened to process data records, both the alternate index
I          and the base cluster are opened.
N
I          When the path consists of a cluster without an alternate
I          index, entryname identifies the cluster. You can define the
I          path as though it were an alias for the cluster. This allows
I          you to specify no-update access to the cluster, so that the
I          upgrade set will not be required or updated when the cluster
I          is opened (provided the open does not cause sharing of a
I          control block structure specifying UPDATE). You can also
I          establish protection attributes for the alternate name,
I          separate from the protection attributes of the cluster.
N
I          Entry name must not identify a VVDS.
N
NOptional Parameters
N-------------------
D      MODEL(entryname catname) -
I        Specifies an existing path entry that is to be used as a model
I        for the path being defined. You can use some attributes of the
I        model and override others by explicitly specifying them in the
I        definition of the path. When you do not want to add or change
I        any attributes, you specify only the entry type (PATH), the
I        path's name, its alternate index's or cluster's name, and the
I        model entry's name.
N
I        Search "Understanding the Order of Assigned Data Set
I        Attributes" for more information about the order in which the
I        system selects an attribute.
N
I        entryname: names the entry to be used as a model. The entryname
I          must name a path entry.
N
I        catname:  names the model entry's catalog.
N
I          If the catalog's volume is physically mounted, it is
I          dynamically allocated. The volume must be mounted as
I          permanently resident or reserved. Search "Catalog Selection
I          Order for DEFINE" for information about the order in which
I          a catalog is selected when the catalog's name is not
I          specified. Unless you have RACF authorization to the directed
I          catalog facility, you should not specify catalog names for
I          SMS-managed data sets. For TSO users, if the owner is not
I          identified with the OWNER parameter, the TSO user's userid
I          becomes the ownerid.
N
D      OWNER(ownerid) -
I        specifies the identification of the path's owner.
N
D      RECATALOG | NORECATALOG /* Abbreviations: RCTLG and NRCTLG */ -
I        Specifies whether a path entry is to be created for the first
I        time or recataloged.
N
I        RECATALOG /* Abbreviation: RCTLG */: specifies that a path
I          entry is to be recataloged. This requires that the NAME and
I          PATHENTRY parameters be specified as they were when the path
I          was originally defined.
N
I          If the ATTEMPTS, AUTHORIZATION, CATALOG, MODEL or OWNER
I          parameters were specified during the original define, they
I          must be respecified with RECATALOG to restore their original
I          values; otherwise, their default values are used.
N
M            ATTEMPTS and AUTHORIZATION no longer appear as valid
M            parameters.
N
I        NORECATALOG /* Abbreviation: NRCTLG */: specifies that a new
I          path entry is to be created in a catalog.
N
D      TO(date) | FOR(days) -
I        Specifies the retention period for the path. The path is not
I        automatically deleted when the expiration date is reached.
I        When a retention period is not specified, the path can be
I        deleted at any time. The MANAGEMENTCLASS maximum retention
I        period, if specified, limits the retention period specified
I        by this parameter for SMS-managed data sets.
N
I        TO(date): Specifies the earliest date that a command without
I          the PURGE parameter can delete the path. Specify
I          the expiration date in the form yyyyddd, where yyyy is a
I          four-digit year (to a maximum of 2155) and ddd is the
I          three-digit day of the year from 001 through 365 (for
I          non-leap years) or 366 (for leap years).
N
I          The following four values are "never-expire" dates:
I          99365, 99366, 1999365, and 1999366. Specifying a
I          "never-expire" date means that the PURGE parameter will
I          always be required to delete the non-VSAM data set. For
I          related information, see the "EXPDT Parameter" section of
I          z/OS MVS JCL Reference, SA22-7597.
N
I          Notes:
N
I          1. Any dates with two-digit years (other than 99365 or 99366)
I             will be treated as pre-2000 dates. (See note 2.)
N
I          2. Specifying the current date or a prior date as the
I             expiration date will make the path  immediately eligible
I             for deletion.
N
D        FOR(days): specifies the number of days to keep the path. The
I          maximum number is 93000. If the number is 0 through 92999
I          (except for 9999), the entry is retained for the number of
I          days indicated. If the number is either 9999 or 93000, the
I          entry is retained indefinitely. There is a hardware imposed
I          expiration date of 2155.
N
D      UPDATE | NOUPDATE /* Abbreviation: UPD and NUPD */ -
I        specifies whether the base cluster's upgrade set is to be
I        allocated when the path is opened for processing.
N
I        The upgrade set is a group of alternate indexes associated with
I        the base cluster. The alternate indexes are opened whenever the
I        base cluster is opened.
N
I        UPDATE /* Abbreviation: UPD */: specifies that, when records
I          in the base cluster are modified or deleted, or when records
I          are added to the base cluster, each alternate index in the
I          base cluster's upgrade set is modified to reflect the change
I          in the cluster's data, just as a key-sequenced cluster's
I          index is modified each time the cluster's data changes.
N
I        NOUPDATE /* Abbreviation: NUPD */: specifies that, when opening
I          the path, the path's base cluster is to be allocated and the
I          base cluster's upgrade set is not to be allocated.
N
I          You can specify the NOUPDATE attribute for the path even
I          though the UPGRADE attribute is set for one of the base
I          cluster's alternate indexes. When a path points to a base
I          cluster that has a large upgrade set (that is, many alternate
I          indexes are associated with the base cluster), and the path
I          is defined with the NOUPDATE attribute, you can open the
I          path, and consequently the base cluster, and none of the
I          alternate indexes will be opened.
N
I          NOUPDATE will be overridden by opening the path, allowing
I          sharing of a control block structure that permits UPDATE.
N
D    ) /* - */
N
M    CATALOG(catname) /* Abbreviation: CAT */
I      Identifies the catalog that contains the entry of the cluster or
I      alternate index named in the PATHENTRY parameter. Search
I      "Catalog Selection Order for DEFINE" for the order in which a
I      catalog is selected if the catalog's name is not specified.
N
I      catname/alias: Names the catalog or an alias that can be resolved
I        to a catalog. For example, if alias ABCD relates to catalog
I         SYS1.USERCAT, then specifying either ABCD or SYS1.USERCAT will
I         cause the cluster to be defined in SYS1.USERCAT.
N
I        If the catalog's volume is physically mounted, it is
I        dynamically allocated. Mount the volume as permanently
I        resident or reserved.
