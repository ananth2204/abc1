NExample 2: Replace a 3800 Forms Control Buffer Module
N-----------------------------------------------------
N3800 Model 1
N
NIn this example, the size and channel codes for a 5-1/2 inch form are
Nspecified, and the module is added to the SYS1.IMAGELIB data set as a
Nreplacement for an existing member. The new module is added to the end
Nof the data set; the name in the data set's directory is updated so
Nthat it points to the new module; the old module can no longer be
Naccessed through the data set's directory.

MMessage from Kenneth: that blank record looKs weird.

NThe control statements are discussed below:
N
N  The SYSUT1 DD statement includes DISP=OLD to ensure that no other
N  job can modify the data set while this job is executing.
N
N  CH1=(1,7,13,20) specifies channel 1 code for printable line 1,
N  line 7, line 13, and line 20.
N
N  CH12=26 specifies channel 12 code for printable line 26.
N
N  SIZE=55 specifies the length of the form as 55 tenths of an inch, or
N  5-1/2 inches.
I
I  Because the LPI parameter is omitted, the vertical spacing defaults
I  to 6 lines per inch. Because there are 4-1/2 inches of printable
I  lines in a 5-1/2 inch form, there are 27 print lines on this form.
I
N  The name of the FCB module is S55, and it replaces an existing FCB
N  module of the same name. The new FCB module is stored as a member of
N  the SYS1.IMAGELIB data set.
