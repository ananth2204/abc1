NChapter 13. FILE resources
N--------------------------
NA FILE resource defines the physical and operational characteristics
Nof a file.
N
NThe FILE definition includes attributes that provide information about
Nrecord characteristics, the types of operations allowed on the file,
Nrecovery attributes, and the operations that are to be journaled. CICS
Nfiles usually correspond to physical data sets that must have been
Ndefined to VSAM before they are used. Using CICS files, your
Napplications can:
N
N-> Access records in the data set directly
N
N-> Access records in a data table that has been loaded from the data
N   set
N
N-> Access records in a coupling facility data table where there is no
N   data set involved (because LOAD(NO) is specified on the CFDT file
N   definition).
N
NThe following resources associated with CICS files can be managed using
NRDO:
N
N-> VSAM files (this includes files that refer to CICS-maintained,
N   user-maintained, and coupling facility data tables as well as files
N   that refer to VSAM data sets)
N
N-> Remote VSAM files
N
N-> Remote BDAM files
N
N-> VSAM local shared resource (LSR) pools, which are defined by LSRPOOL
N   resource definitions
N
NFor the file to be used by an active CICS system, its definition must
Nhave been installed on to the system. CICS file control uses the
Ninstalled definition to find the file when it needs to access it, to
Nkeep count of the number of tasks using the file, to capture processing
Nstatistics, and maintain other file control information.
