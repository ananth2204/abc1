NProblem data for modules
N------------------------
NFor a module, the system saves and restores status from different
Nlocations, depending on the processing mode of the module when it lost
Ncontrol. Use the IPCS STATUS CPU subcommand to find out the mode of the
Nmodule that had been currently running for each processor. Use
Nthe saved status as problem data for diagnosis.
N
NProcessing modes
N----------------
NThe processing modes follow. Code always runs in one or more of these
Nmodes. For example, code running in task or service request block (SRB)
Nmode can also be either locally locked or physically disabled.
N
N-> Task mode
N
N-> SRB Mode
N
N-> Physically disabled mode
N
N-> Locked mode
N
N-> Cross memory mode
