NExample 2: Ripple 10-byte Alphabetic Pattern
N--------------------------------------------
NIn this example, a 10-byte alphabetic pattern is rippled. At the end of
Nthe job step the first output record contains "ABCDEFGHIJ", followed by
Ndata in location 11 through 80 from the input record; the second record
Ncontains "BCDEFGHIJK" followed by data in locations 11 through 80, and
Nso forth.

NThe control statements are discussed below:
N
N  SEQIN DD defines an input sequential data set (INSET). The data set
N  was originally written on a standard labeled tape volume.
N
N  SEQOUT DD defines the test output data set (OUTSET). Ten tracks of
N  primary space and ten tracks of secondary space are allocated for
N  the sequential data set on a disk volume.
N
N  SYSIN DD defines the control data set, which follows in the input
N  stream.
N
N  DSD marks the beginning of a set of utility control statements and
N  refers to the DD statements defining the input and output data sets.
N
N  The FD statement creates a 10-byte field in which the pattern
N  ABCDEFGHIJ is initially placed. The data is rippled after each
N  output record is written.
N
N  CREATE constructs 100 output records in which the contents of a
N  previously defined field (FIELD1) are included. The CREATE statement
N  uses input records from data set INSET as the basis of the output
N  records.
N
N  END signals the end of a set of utility control statements.
