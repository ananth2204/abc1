NChapter 20. MQCONN resources
N----------------------------
NAn MQCONN resource defines the attributes of the connection between
NCICS and WebSphere MQ. You can install or discard an MQCONN resource
Nonly when CICS is not connected to WebSphere MQ.
N
NOnly one MQCONN resource can be installed at a time in a CICS region.
NWhen you define an MQCONN resource, CICS checks to ensure that there
Nis only one MQCONN resource defined in the group or list. If more than
None is found, even one with a different name, a warning message is
Nissued. If you do install a second MQCONN resource, CICS implicitly
Ndiscards the existing MQCONN resource before proceeding with the
Ninstallation, unless you are reinstalling an MQCONN resource with the
Nsame name.
N
NWhen you have installed the MQCONN resource, you can use the CEMT or
NEXEC CICS SET MQCONN command, CICSPlex SM, or the CICS Explorer to
Nstart the connection between CICS and WebSphere MQ.
N
NWhen you install an MQCONN resource that includes a setting for the
NINITQNAME attribute, CICS also dynamically creates and installs an
NMQINI resource. The MQINI resource represents the default initiation
Nqueue that is specified by the INITQNAME attribute of the MQCONN
Nresource. The name of the MQINI resource is DFHMQINI, and its attribute
NINITQNAME specifies the initiation queue name.
N
NYou can use the EXEC CICS or CEMT INQUIRE MQINI command to inquire on
Nthe INITQNAME attribute of the dynamically created MQINI resource. If
Nyou want to change it, you must reinstall the MQCONN resource with an
Nappropriate INITQNAME attribute. The MQINI resource is discarded when
Nthe MQCONN resource is discarded.
N
NWhen you discard an MQCONN resource that includes a setting for the
NINITQNAME attribute, the dynamically created MQINI resource that
Nrepresents the default initiation queue specified by the INITQNAME
Nattribute is also discarded.
