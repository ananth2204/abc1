N----------------------------------------------
NExample 6: Create and Update a Library Member
N---------------------------------------------
NIn this example, a member of a partitioned data set is created from
Nsequential input and existing logical records are updated.

N
NThe control statements are discussed below:
N
N  SYSUT1 DD defines the input sequential data set (BROWN.OLDSEQDS).
N  The data set resides on a tape volume.
N
N  SYSUT2 DD defines the output partitioned data set (BROWN.NEWPART).
N  Enough space is allocated to provide for members that may be added
N  in the future.
N
N  SYSIN DD defines the control data set, which follows in the input
N  stream.
N
N  The CHANGE function statement identifies the output member (PARMEM1)
N  and indicates that a conversion from sequential input to partitioned
N  output is made. The SEQFLD parameter indicates that a 5-byte
N  sequence number is located in columns 60 through 64 of each data
N  statement. The COLUMN=40 parameter specifies the starting column of
N  a field (within subsequent data statements) from which replacement
N  information is obtained. SOURCE=0 indicates that the replacement
N  information is provided by you.
N
N  The first data statement is used as replacement data. Columns 40
N  through 80 of the statement replace columns 40 through 80 of the
N  corresponding logical record. If no such logical record exists, the
N  entire card image is inserted in the output data set member.
N
N  The DELETE detail statement deletes all of the logical records
N  having sequence numbers from 220 through 250.
N
N  The second data statement, whose sequence number falls within the
N  range specified in the DELETE detail statement above, is
N  incorporated in its entirety in the output data set member.
N
N  The third data statement, which is beyond the range of the DELETE
N  detail statement, is treated in the same manner as the first data
N  statement.
N
N  ALIAS assigns the alias name MEMB1 to the output data set member
N  PARMEM1.
