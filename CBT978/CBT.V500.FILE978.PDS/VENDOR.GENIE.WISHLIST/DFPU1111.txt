NExample 11: Create a New Partitioned Data Set
N---------------------------------------------
NIn this example, a partitioned generation data set consisting of three
Nmembers is used as source data in the creation of a new partitioned
Ndata set. IEBUPDTE is also used to add a fourth member to the three
Nsource members and to number the new member. The resultant data set is
Ncataloged as a new partitioned data set.

NThe control statements are discussed below:
N
N  SYSUT1 DD defines the partitioned data set, which is used as source
N  data. It can be a PDSE.
N
N  SYSUT2 DD defines the new partitioned data set, which is created
N  from the source partitioned data set and from an additional member
N  included as input and data. It can be a PDSE.
N
N  SYSIN DD defines the control data set, which follows in the input
N  stream.
N
N  The REPRO function statements reproduce the named source members in
N  the output partitioned data set.
N
N  The ADD function statement specifies that the data records following
N  the input stream be included as MEM4.
N
N  The NUMBER detail statement indicates that the new member is to have
N  sequence numbers assigned in columns 73 through 80. The first record
N  is assigned sequence number 10. The sequence number of each
N  successive record is increased by 5.
N
N  ENDUP signals the end of input card data.
* End of WISH.
