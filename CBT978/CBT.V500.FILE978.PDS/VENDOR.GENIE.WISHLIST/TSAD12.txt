NChapter 12: Transaction trace
N-----------------------------
NTransaction trace provides a consolidated trace of key events for the
Nexecution path of application or transaction type work units running in
Na multi-system application environment. By tracing the path of a work
Nunit running in a single system, or (more importantly) across systems
Nin a sysplex environment, that is being processed by multi-system
Ntransaction servers, subsystem interfaces, and resource managers,
Ntransaction trace enables a system programmer to debug problems
Nin those environments.
N
NThe essential task of transaction trace is to aggregate data showing
N the flow of work between components in the sysplex that combine
Nto service a transaction. Transaction trace traces events such as
Ncomponent entry, exit, exceptions and major events such as COMMIT, and
NROLLBACK. Do not use transaction trace as a component tracing facility.
