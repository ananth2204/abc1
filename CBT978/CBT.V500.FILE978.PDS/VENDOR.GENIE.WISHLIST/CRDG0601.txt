NChapter 6. BUNDLE resources
N---------------------------
NSyntax:
N-------
D  DEFINE
D    BUNDLE(name)
I      Specifies the 1 - 8 character name of the BUNDLE.
N
D    GROUP(group)
I      Every resource definition must have a GROUP name.
I      The resource definition becomes a member of the group and is
I      installed in the CICS system when the group is installed.
N
I      The GROUP name can be up to eight characters in length.
I      Lowercase characters are treated as uppercase characters.
N
D    DESCRIPTION(text)
I      In this field, you can provide a description of
I      the resource that you are defining. The description text can be
I      up to 58 characters in length. No restrictions apply to the
I      characters that you can use. However, if you use parentheses,
I      ensure that each left parenthesis has a matching right one. If
I      you use the CREATE command, for each single apostrophe in the
I      text code, use two apostrophes.
N
D    BUNDLEDIR(zfsdirectory)
I      Specifies the 1 - 255 character fully
i      qualified name of the root directory for the bundle on
I      z/OS UNIX. The first character must be / and the end
I      character /.
N
D    BASESCOPE(value)
I      Specifies the 1 - 255 character string that
I      defines the scope for a bundle. Use a uniform resource
I      identifier (URI) where possible. Use the BASESCOPE attribute
I      when you want to group similar bundles together or when you
I      to associate a CICS bundle with a particular application that is
I      running in a platform. The URI for an application has the
I      following format:
I
I      cicsapplication://Platform/ApplicationID/Major/Minor/Micro
I
I      Platform is the name of the platform in which the application
I      is running,
I
I      ApplicationID is the ID of the application BUNDLE,
I
I      followed by the major, minor, and micro version of the
I      application.
N
N
D    STATUS(ENABLED | DISABLED)
I      Specifies the initial status of the BUNDLE
I      resource when it is installed.
N
I    ENABLED: The BUNDLE is available for use. CICS checks that all
I      prerequisites for the bundle are present in the region
I      and attempts to install and enable all of the required
I      resources that are defined in the bundle.
N
I    DISABLED: The BUNDLE is not available for use. CICS does not
I      check for prerequisites and installs, but does not enable,
I      the resources that are defined in the bundle. The default
N      value is empty so that all BUNDLE resources install in the
N      same scope.
