NADDPOP:  Specifies that the panel displays listed are to be in a pop-up
N         window. It also identifies the location of the pop-up window
N         on the screen in relation to the underlying panel or window.
N
NDISPLAY: Reads a panel definition from the panel files, initializes
N         variable information in the panel from the corresponding
N         dialog variables in the function, shared, or profile variable
N         pools, and displays the panel on the screen. Optionally, the
N         DISPLAY service might superimpose a message on the display.
N
NREMPOP:  Removes a pop-up window from the screen.
N
NSELECT:  Used to display a hierarchy of selection panels or invoke a
N         function.
N
NSETMSG:  Constructs a specified message from the message file in an
N         ISPF system save area. The message will be superimposed on the
N         next panel displayed by any DM component service.
N
NTBDISPL: Combines information from panel definitions with information
N         stored in ISPF tables. It displays selected rows from a table,
N         and allows the user to identify rows for processing.
