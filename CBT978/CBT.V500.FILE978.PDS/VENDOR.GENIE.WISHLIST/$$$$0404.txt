NRunning GENIEBLD to rebuild the configuration file
N--------------------------------------------------
N =====================================================================
N
N GUIDE:  This file maps coding construct names in PDS members for the
N         Configuration file of Applications, CHAPTERs, and TOPICs.
N
N =====================================================================
N
N There are three types of records in the configuration file $$$$$$$$.
N They form PDS member names.
N
N        T = TOPIC:
N            It must be 4 characters.
N        C = CHAPTER:
N            It must be 6 characters.
N        W = WISH:
N            It must be 8 characters.
N        * = Comments that are ignored, explains only 3 record types.
N
N Order is important.
N   "T"OPICs       come first.
N   "C"HAPTERs     come second.
N   "W"ISHes       come third.
N
N Multiple records should be in the order you want them
N concatenated together. The ISPF panel shows the fully concatenated
N title, though the width of your display may limit what you see.
N
N I updated GENIE to display several lines if you request information
N using (I) as the line command.
N
N =====================================================================
N
N The WISHLIST members correspond to TOPIC, CHAPTER, and WISH.
N
N %GENIEBLD will use the following record types:
N
N   S = Source member name (Needs to match the member name).
N   K = Keywords.
N   T = Title.
N
N %GENIEBLD will put a Ztimestamp record in the member it creates.
N

* End of WISH.
