NChapter 1. About the GENIE edit macro
N-------------------------------------
NImitation is the sincerest form of flattery
N-------------------------------------------
NI wrote my first ISPF application before REXX was available
Nunder MVS. Somehow I came upon the MODEL command and looked
Ninto extending it to be more than IBM provides. Two issues
Npop up: touching an IBM provided panel and where to put the
Nadded content.
N
NAs a System Programmer I know to create a USERMOD to track the change
Nto the panel and prevent a PTF from overlaying my change without taking
Nan overt action.
N
NI also have control over the logon procedures and initial code
Nexecuted from the PARM field.
N
NNeither solution appealed to me. For my own use I created an edit
Nmacro that I named INSERTS and populated a PDS with the types
NDATA lines I would want to insert in something I was editing.
N
NIn retirement mode I decided I would start expanding upon the items
Nthe INSERTS edit macro would use. That led to giving more thought
Ninto the name of the edit macro and members it uses. Thus was
Nthe rebranding to GENIE and it granting a WISH.
N
NThe INSERTS code has been vastly modified to provide a more robust
Nuser interface and the modified WISH format.
N
NDue to the greater number of WISH members compared to what MODEL
Nsupports, the WISH naming convention does not lend itself to
Na command or verb like name. KEYWORD (find) and SEARCH (string)
Nallow for finding one or more WISH members that might be what
Nyou seek. You can also expand TOPICs to show CHAPTERs and expand
NChapters to see individual WISH items.
* End of WISH.
