NChapter 36. WEBSERVICE resources
N--------------------------------
NSyntax:
N-------
D  DEFINE
D    WEBSERVICE(name)
I      Specifies the 1-8 character name of the WEBSERVICE
I      resource.
N
I      It is preferable not to use names that start with DFH because
I      these characters are reserved for use by CICS. CICS can delete or
I      discard them and replace them with CICS resources when you upgrade
I      or provide new function or fixes.
N
D    GROUP(groupname)
I      Every resource definition must have a GROUP name.
I      The resource definition becomes a member of the group and is
I      installed in the CICS system when the group is installed.
N
I      The GROUP name can be up to 8 characters in length. Lowercase
I      characters are treated as uppercase characters.
N
D    DESCRIPTION(text)
I      You can provide a description of the resource that
I      you are defining in this field. The description text can be up to
I      58 characters in length. No restrictions apply to the characters
I      that you can use. However, if you use parentheses, ensure that for
I      each left parenthesis there is a matching right parenthesis. If you
I      use the CREATE command, for each single apostrophe in the text,
I      code two apostrophes.
N
D    ARCHIVEFILE(hfsfile)
I      Specifies the 1-255 character fully qualified
I      or relative name of an archive that contains one or more WSDL
I      files. The supported format for the archive is .zip.
N
I      -> For an archive for a WEBSERVICE resource defined by online
I         resource definition, the file path is either fully qualified,
I         if prefixed with a forward slash (/), or is relative to the
I         HOME directory of the CICS region user ID.
N
I      -> For an archive for a WEBSERVICE resource defined in a CICS
I         bundle, the file path is relative to the root directory of the
I         CICS bundle. The zFS file must be packaged in the CICS bundle
I         with the WEBSERVICE resource. For more information, see
I        "Referencing zFS artifacts in a bundle".
N
D    PIPELINE(pipelinename)
I      Specifies the 1-8 character name of the
I      PIPELINE resource with which this WEBSERVICE resource is
I      associated.
N
D    VALIDATION(NO | YES)
I      Specifies whether full validation of SOAP
I      messages against the corresponding schema in the web service
I      description should be performed at run time. Validating a SOAP
I      message against its schema incurs considerable processing overhead,
I      and you should normally specify VALIDATION(NO).
N
I      Full validation ensures that all SOAP messages that are sent and
I      received are valid XML with respect to the XML schema. If
I      VALIDATION(NO) is specified, checking is performed to ensure that
I      the message contains well-formed XML, but there is no guarantee
I      that the XML is valid.
N
D    WSBIND(hfsfile)
I      Specifies the 1-255 character fully-qualified or
I      relative name of the web service binding file on z/OS UNIX.
N
I      -> For a web service binding file for a WEBSERVICE resource
I         defined by online resource definition, the file path is either
I         fully qualified, if prefixed with a forward slash (/), or is
I         relative to the HOME directory of the CICS region user ID.
N
I      -> For a web service binding file for a WEBSERVICE defined in a
I         CICS bundle, the file path is relative to the root directory
I         of the CICS bundle. The zFS file must be packaged in the CICS
I         bundle with the WEBSERVICE resource. For more information, see
I         "Referencing zFS artifacts in a bundle".
N
D    WSDLFILE(hfsfile)
I      Specifies the 1-255 character fully-qualified or
I      relative name of the web service description (WSDL) file on
I      z/OS UNIX. This file is used when full runtime validation is
I      active.
N
I      -> For a web service description file for a WEBSERVICE resource
I         defined by online resource definition, the file path is either
I         fully qualified, if prefixed with a forward slash (/), or is
I         relative to the HOME directory of the CICS region user ID.
N
I      -> For a web service description file for a WEBSERVICE resource
I         defined in a CICS bundle, the file path is relative to the
I         root directory of the CICS bundle. The zFS file must be packaged
I         in the CICS bundle with the WEBSERVICE resource. For more
I         information, see "Referencing zFS artifacts in a bundle".
