NThe JCL statements are:
N-----------------------
N-> DD1: statement that both describes the VVDS volume and causes it
N   to be mounted.
N
NThe DELETE parameters are:
N--------------------------
N-> SYS1.VVDS.V338001: is the name of the VVDS.
N
N-> FILE: specifies the name of a DD statement.
N
N-> RECOVERY: specifies that the VVDS entry is being deleted from the
N   VTOC as part of a recovery operation.

M   IBM's text for this example both claims the VTOC entry will remain
M   intact and that it will be deleted. Only one of those can be true.
