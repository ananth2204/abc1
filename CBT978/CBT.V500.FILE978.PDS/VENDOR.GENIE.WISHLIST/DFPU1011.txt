NExample 11: Print Member Containing DBCS Data
N---------------------------------------------
NIn this example, a member of a partitioned data set that contains DBCS
Ndata is printed after the DBCS data is checked to ensure that all DBCS
Ncharacters are printable.
N
D//DBCS     JOB ...
D//ST01#01 EXEC PGM=IEBPTPCH
D//SYSPRINT  DD SYSOUT=*
D//SYSUT1    DD DISP=(OLD),DSN=PDS
D//SYSUT2    DD SYSOUT=*
D//SYSIN     DD *
D         PRINT TYPORG=PO,DBCS=YES,MAXFLDS=1,MAXNAME=1
D         MEMBER NAME=MEM1
D         RECORD FIELD=(,,CV)
D/*
N
NThe control statements are discussed below:
N
N  SYSUT1 DD defines the input data set, PDS, on a disk volume.
N
N  SYSUT2 DD defines the system printer as the output data set.
N
N  SYSIN DD defines the control data set, which follows in the input
N  stream.
N
N  PRINT begins the print operation, indicates that the input data set
N  is partitioned, and indicates that double-byte character set data
N  will be printed. The statement also indicates that one MEMBER
N  statement appears in the control data set, and that one FIELD
N  parameter appears on a subsequent RECORD statement.
N
N  MEMBER specifies the member, MEM1, that is to be printed.
N
N  RECORD specifies that the DBCS data is to be checked to ensure that
N  it is printable.
* End of WISH.
