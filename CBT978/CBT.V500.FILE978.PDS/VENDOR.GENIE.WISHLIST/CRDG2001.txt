NChapter 20. MQCONN resources
N----------------------------
NSyntax:
N-------
D  DEFINE
D    MQCONN(name)
I      Specifies the 8-character name of this resource
I      definition.
N
D    GROUP(groupname)
I      Every resource definition must have a GROUP name.
I      The resource definition becomes a member of the group and is
I      installed in the CICS system when the group is installed.
N
I      The GROUP name can be up to 8 characters in length. Lowercase
I      characters are treated as uppercase characters.
N
D    DESCRIPTION(text)
I      You can provide a description of the resource that
I      you are defining in this field. The description text can be up to
I      58 characters in length. No restrictions apply to the characters
I      that you can use. However, if you use parentheses, ensure that for
I      each left parenthesis there is a matching right parenthesis. If you
I      use the CREATE command, for each single apostrophe in the text,
I      code two apostrophes.
N
D    INITQNAME(name)
I      Specifies the 1 - 48 character name of the default
I      initiation queue for this CICS-WebSphere MQ connection.
N
I      When you install the MQCONN resource definition, if you specify a
I      non-blank INITQNAME attribute, CICS installs an implicit MQINI
I      resource to represent the default initiation queue. The name of
I      the MQINI resource is DFHMQINI, and its attribute INITQNAME
I      specifies the default initiation queue name. You can inquire on
I      this resource, but you cannot explicitly create, discard, or set
I      the resource. If you want to change it, you must reinstall the
I      MQCONN resource definition with an appropriate INITQNAME attribute.
N
I      If you specify the name of a default initiation queue when you
I      start the CICS-WebSphere MQ connection by using the CKQC START
I      command, the setting for the INITQNAME attribute in the installed
I      MQINI resource definition is replaced with the name of the default
I      initiation queue that you specified on the command.
N
D    MQNAME(name)
I      Specifies the 1 - 4 character name of either a single
I      WebSphere MQ queue manager, or a queue-sharing group of WebSphere
I      MQ queue managers.
N
I      -> If you specify a single queue manager, when you start the
I         CICS-WebSphere MQ connection, CICS connects only to this queue
I         manager.
N
I      -> If you specify a queue-sharing group, when you start the
I         connection, CICS connects to any active member of this group
I         on the same LPAR. Use the RESYNCMEMBER attribute to specify
I         what happens when CICS is holding outstanding units of work
I         for the last queue manager to which it connected from the
I         queue-sharing group.
N
I      -> If you specify RESYNCMEMBER(GROUPRESYNC) then MQNAME must be
I         the name of a queue-sharing group.
N
I      The name of the queue manager or queue-sharing group must not
I      start with a numeric character.
N
I      WebSphere MQ uses the @ symbol to pad queue-sharing group names
I      that are less than four characters long. When you specify a
I      queue-sharing group that is less than four characters long, do not
I      include the @ symbols at the end; CICS adds the padding before
I      querying the queue-sharing group. For example, if the
I      queue-sharing group is defined to WebSphere MQ as DEV@, specify
I      DEV as the value of the MQNAME attribute.
N
I      If you specify the name of an alternative WebSphere MQ queue
I      manager or queue-sharing group on the CEMT or
I      EXEC CICS SET MQCONN command, or specify a queue manager name when
I      you start the CICS-WebSphere MQ connection by using the
I      CKQC START command, CICS connects to that alternative queue
I      manager or queue-sharing group. In addition, your setting for the
I      MQNAME attribute in the installed MQCONN definition is replaced
I      with the name of the queue manager or queue-sharing group that you
I      specified on the command. If you want to revert to the original
I      queue manager or queue-sharing group, set MQNAME again.
N
D    RESYNCMEMBER(YES | NO | GROUPRESYNC)
I      This attribute applies only if
I      you use the MQNAME attribute to specify a WebSphere MQ
I      queue-sharing group. RESYNCMEMBER specifies the strategy that
I      CICS adopts if outstanding units of work are being held for the
I      last queue manager to which CICS was connected from the
I      queue-sharing group.
N
I      Changing the setting for RESYNCMEMBER must be done only when all
I      resources are in a consistent state; that is, there are no indoubt
I      units of work outstanding otherwise CICS is not able to
I      resynchronize the WebSphere MQ units of work. It is important to
I      ensure that all resources are in a consistent state before changing
I      RESYNCMEMBER to or from GROUPRESYNC.
N
I      YES: CICS connects to the same queue manager, waiting, if
I        necessary, until the queue manager becomes active to resolve
I        the indoubt units of work. YES is the default.
N
I      NO: CICS makes one attempt to connect to the same queue manager.
I        If that attempt fails, CICS connects to any member of the
I        queue-sharing group and issues the warning message DFHMQ2064
I        about the outstanding units of work.
N
I      GROUPRESYNC: CICS connects to any member of the queue-sharing
I        group. The queue manager is chosen by WebSphere MQ and it asks
I        CICS to resolve indoubt units of work on behalf of all eligible
I        queue managers in the queue-sharing group. This function is
I        called group unit of recovery. The GROUPRESYNC option can be
I        used only when you are running WebSphere MQ 7.1, or higher, that
I        supports group unit of recovery for CICS and when group unit of
I        recovery is enabled in the queue managers.
N
I      The main use of the GROUPRESYNC option is with shared queues, but
I      it can be used with private queues. Messages on shared queues are
I      resolved immediately, but resolution of private queues occurs when
I      the owning queue manager restarts. If using private queues, it can
I      be convenient to define the queues with QSGDISP(GROUP).
N
I      QSGDISP(GROUP) ensures that an instance of the private queue exists
I      on every manager in the queue sharing group, so that in the event
I      of failure and reconnection to a different queue manager, the
I      application can continue using the new queue instance. The
I      application would need to be able to tolerate using a new queue
I      instance.
N
I      Do not change the setting for RESYNCMEMBER when units of work
I      are outstanding in WebSphere MQ, because units of work cannot be
I      resolved. A unit of work held in CICS is identified with a resource
I      manager qualifier. When RESYNCMEMBER(GROUPRESYNC) is used the
I      qualifier is the name of the queue-sharing group, otherwise the
I      qualifier used is the name of the individual queue manager.
N
I      Units of work that are shunted indoubt are not included in this
I      process, because CICS itself cannot resolve those units of work
I      at this time.
N
I      Resynchronization for those UOWs occurs when CICS has
I      resynchronized with its remote coordinator.
N
I      If you share a CICS system definition data set (CSD) with an
I      earlier release of CICS an MQCONN definition specifying
I      RESYNCMEMBER(GROUPRESYNC) is installed as RESYNCMEMBER(NO).
