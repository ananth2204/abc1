NChapter 9. Using Deferred-Printing Mode
N---------------------------------------
NPSF supports AFP printers as system output devices for deferred
Nprinting under the Job Entry Subsystem (JES). Some system printers
Nare managed by a JES output writer that operates entirely in the
NJES address space. PSF-attached printers, however, are defined as
Nfunctional subsystem applications (FSAs) that run under a separate
Naddress space called a PSF functional subsystem (FSS). A functional
Nsubsystem interface (FSI) maintains communication between the FSS
Nand the JES global address space.
