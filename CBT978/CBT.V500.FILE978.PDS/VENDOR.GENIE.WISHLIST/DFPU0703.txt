NExample 3: Replace a 3800 Forms Control Buffer Module
N-----------------------------------------------------
N3800 Model 1
N
NIn this example, the vertical spacing, channel codes, and size for a
Nform are specified, and the module is added to the SYS1.IMAGELIB data
Nset as a replacement for an existing member. The new module is added to
Nthe end of the data set; the name in the data set's directory is
Nupdated so that it points to the new module; the old module can no
Nlonger be accessed through the data set's directory.

NThe control statements are discussed below:
N
N  The SYSUT1 DD statement includes DISP=OLD to ensure that no other
N  job can modify the data set while this job is executing.
N
N  CH1=1 specifies channel 1 code for printable line 1.
N
N  CH2=4 specifies channel 2 code for line 4.
N
N  CH5=11 specifies channel 5 code for line 11.
N
N  SIZE=35 specifies the length of the form as 35 tenths of an inch, or
N  3-1/2 inches. Because there are 2-1/2 inches of printable space on
N  a 3-1/2 inch form, and because the LPI parameter specifies vertical
N  spacing for 2-1/2 inches of lines, the vertical spacing of all lines
N  in the form is accounted for.
N
N  LPI=((6,2),(8,3),(6,4),(8,9)) specifies vertical spacing for the
N  first 18 printable lines in the form: (6,2) specifies lines 1
N  through 2 are at a vertical spacing of 6 lines per inch, and take up
N  2/6 inch. (8,3) specifies lines 3 through 5 are at a vertical
N  spacing of 8 lines per inch, and take up 3/8 inch. (6,4) specifies
N  lines 6 through 9 are at a vertical spacing of 6 lines per inch, and
N  take up 4/6 inch. (8,9) specifies lines 10 through 18 are at a
N  vertical spacing of 8 lines per inch, and take up 1-1/8 inch.
N
N  The name of the FCB module is HL; it replaces an existing module of
N  the same name. The new FCB module is stored as a member of the
N  SYS1.IMAGELIB data set.
