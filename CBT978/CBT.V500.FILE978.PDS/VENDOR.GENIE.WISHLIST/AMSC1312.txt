NThe DEFINE ALTERNATEINDEX parameters are:
N-----------------------------------------
N-> NAME: indicates that the alternate index's name is EXMP2.AIX.
N
N-> RELATE: identifies the alternate index base cluster, EXAMPLE.SMS2.
N   Because an SMS-managed alternate index is being defined, the base
N   cluster must also be SMS-managed.
N
N-> KEYS: specifies the length and location of the alternate key field
N   in each of the base cluster's data records. The alternate key field
N   is the first three bytes of each data record.
N
N-> KILOBYTES: allocates the minimum number of tracks required to
N   contain 1600 kilobytes for the alternate index's space. When the
N   alternate index is extended, it is to be extended by the minimum
N   number of tracks required to contain 200 kilobytes.
N
N-> RECORDSIZE: specifies that the alternate index's records are
N   variable length, with an average size of 40 bytes and a maximum
N   size of 50 bytes.
N
N-> NONUNIQUEKEY: specifies that the alternate key value might be the
N   same for two or more data records in the base cluster.
N
N-> UPGRADE: specifies that the alternate index is to be opened by VSAM
N   and upgraded each time the base cluster is opened for processing.
