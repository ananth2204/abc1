NKenneth Tomiak Programming Method
N---------------------------------
NKenneth is sharing some knowledge and expereince from his
Ndecades working in the computer field and hobby activities.
N
NMy decision to include some material as a GENIE TOPIC stems
Nfrom wanting to be able to take advantage of what GENIE offers.
NI have other material on the CBTTAPE Web Site, http://www.cbttape.org
Nfor those people looking for in-house built tools and applications.
N
NWhen I created the INSERTS Edit macro I envisioned adding TOPICS
Nbased solely on IBM manuals. It was easy to use four (4) characters
Nas a TOPIC and then the Chapter numbers because I had a very limited
Nset of manuals in mind. Plus the manuals already existed. INSERTS
Nwas renamed to GENIE and underwent some major modifications to
Nbecome what it is today.
N
NToday, 2018-05-22, I am embarking on a major rebranding of
N'Programming Using The Kenneth Tomiak Method (PUTKTM)' to
N'Kenneth Tomiak Programming Method (KTPM)' as I start working
Non a virtual manual documenting the reasoning behind my
Nrecommendations and suggestions. I will suffer as I try to
Ncreate Sections and Chapters in an organized sequence and later
Ncome up with a new subject that ought to fit between existing
NChapters. Herein is my initial concept.
N
NSections

NIn some books and manuals they may refer to these as Parts.
