NArithmetic operation rules additional operators
N-----------------------------------------------
NThe operation rules for the power (**), integer divide (%), and
Nremainder (//) operators follow.
N
N
NPower
N-----
NThe ** (power) operator raises a number to a power, which may be
Npositive, negative, or 0. The power must be a whole number. (The
Nsecond term in the operation must be a whole number and is rounded to
NDIGITS digits, if necessary. If negative, the absolute value of the
Npower is used, and then the result is inverted (divided into 1). For
Ncalculating the power, the number is effectively multiplied by itself
Nfor the number of times expressed by the power, and finally trailing
Nzeros are removed (as though the result were divided by 1).

N
NInteger division
N----------------
NThe % (integer divide) operator divides two numbers and returns the
Ninteger part of the result. The result returned is defined to be that
Nwhich would result from repeatedly subtracting the divisor from the
Ndividend while the dividend is larger than the divisor. During this
Nsubtraction, the absolute values of both the dividend and the divisor
Nare used: the sign of the final result is the same as that which would
Nresult from regular division.
N
N
NRemainder
N---------
NThe // (remainder) operator returns the remainder from integer
Ndivision and is defined as being the residue of the dividend after
Nthe operation of calculating integer division as previously described.
NThe sign of the remainder, if nonzero, is the same as that of the
Noriginal dividend.
