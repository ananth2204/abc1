NChapter 32. SHCDS
N-----------------
NUse the SHCDS command to list SMSVSAM recovery associated with
Nsubsystems spheres and to control that recovery. This command works
Nboth in batch and in the TSO/E foreground. The functions include the
Nfollowing subcommands:
N
N-> List subcommands
N
N-> Subcommands that enable you to take action on work that was shunted
N
N-> Subcommands to control a manual forward recovery in the absence of
N   a forward recovery utility that supports SMSVSAM protocols
N
N-> Subcommands that enable you to run critical non-RLS batch window
N   work when it is not possible to first close out all outstanding
N   SMSVSAM recovery
N
N-> A subcommand that allows for a subsystem cold start
N
N   Recommendation: After a cold start, if recovery was not completed
N   for any data sets, they are most likely left in a damaged state and
N   must be recovered manually. If the data sets are forward
N   recoverable, their forward recovery logs might also be damaged.
N   Manually recover the data sets (without using forward recovery),
N   take backups of them and of any other data sets that use the forward
N   recovery log, and then delete and redefine the forward recovery log.
N
NUse this command cautiously. CICS Recovery and Restart Guide describes
Nmany of the situations that require the use of the SHCDS command. See
Nz/OS DFSMSdfp Storage Administration for details about administering
NVSAM RLS. See Appendix C, "Interpreting SHCDS Output Listings" in the
Nmanual for SHCDS output listings.
