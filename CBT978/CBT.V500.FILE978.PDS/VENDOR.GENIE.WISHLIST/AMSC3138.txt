N--------------------------
NCase 8: Setting Cache Off for the Subsystem
N-------------------------------------------
NSETCACHE SUBSYSTEM OFF sets normal caching off for the subsystem. The
Nfollowing actions occur:
N
N-> Device caching, cache fast write, and DASD fast write stop. Device
N   status, with respect to each of these functions, is retained and the
N   active functions resume when subsystem caching is set on. When DASD
N   fast write and dual copy are set on together (fast dual copy), the
N   data is destaged from NVS to both devices.
N
N-> Each duplex pair is set to suspended state on the first write
N   operation to the pair. Also, any duplex pairs with
N   out-of-synchronization cylinders are suspended after SETCACHE
N   SUBSYSTEM OFF is issued. However, if there is no write activity to
N   a duplex pair, and all cylinders are in synchronization, the pair
N   is not set to suspended duplex state.
N
N-> The Storage Control destages all modified data from cache and NVS
N   to DASD.
