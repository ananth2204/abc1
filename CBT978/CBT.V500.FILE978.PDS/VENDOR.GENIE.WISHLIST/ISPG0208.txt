NChapter 2. Description of the ISPF services
N-------------------------------------------
NEDIF-Edit interface
N-------------------
NThe Edit Interface (EDIF) service provides edit functions for data
Naccessed through dialog-supplied I/O routines. The invoking dialog must
Nperform all environment-dependent functions such as file allocation,
Nopening, reading, writing, closing, and freeing. The dialog is also
Nresponsible for any Enqueue/Dequeue serialization that is required.
NWith the dialog providing the I/O routines, EDIF allows you to:
N
N-> Edit data other than partitioned data sets or sequential files such
N   as subsystem data, and in-storage data.
N
N-> Do preprocessing and post-processing of the data being edited. The
N   invoking dialog must provide addresses to routines that:
N
N-> Read the data sequentially from beginning to end, returning to Edit
N   one record on each invocation.
N
N-> Write the data sequentially from beginning to end, accepting one
N   record from Edit on each invocation.
N
N-> Perform processing for the MOVE, COPY, CREATE, REPLACE, and EDIT
N   primary commands. If this routine is not specified, ISPF processes
N   these commands.
N
NAll addresses must be 31-bit addresses, and the routines must have an
Naddressing mode (AMODE) of 31.
N
NWhen an Edit session is operating in recovery mode, a record of your
Ninteractions is automatically recorded in an ISPF-controlled data set.
NFollowing a system failure, you can use the record to recover the data
Nyou were editing.
N
NNote: Dialogs that invoke the EDIF service may invoke the EDIREC
Nservice first to determine if a pending recovery condition exists.
N
MYou must use the EDIF service to recover data edited in a previous
MEDIF session. You must invoke the EDIREC service first to see if a
Mrecovery is pending.
N
NA dialog using EDIF can place data into the ZEIUSER dialog variable in
Nthe shared pool. When the system initializes the recovery data set, the
Nsystem also saves the data in ZEIUSER in the Edit recovery table as an
Nextension variable. This is done if RECOVERY is ON when first entering
NEdit or after you use the SAVE command. This data is then made
Navailable in dialog variable ZEIUSER at the time edit recovery is
Nprocessed.
N
NCommand invocation format
N-------------------------
NYou cannot use command procedures to invoke this service.
N
MWhat-if someone used LINKMVS on ISPLINK? Hmmm.
N
NCall invocation format
N----------------------
D  CALL ISPLINK ('EDIFbbbb', +
D      data-name | 'b', +
I        This parameter allows you to specify a data name for the source
I        data to be edited. This name appears in the title line of the
I        default Edit panel. It is also the target data name for an edit
I        recovery table entry when edit recovery is active. This name
I        must not have any embedded blanks, and its maximum length is
I        54 characters. This name is stored in ZDSNT in the function
I        pool.
N
D      profile-name, +
I        The name of the edit profile to be used. This parameter is
I        required when recovery-request = NO or is not specified;
I        otherwise, it is not allowed.
N
D      rec-format, +
I        The record format:
I        -> F - fixed,
I        -> V - variable.
I        This parameter is required when recovery-request = NO or is not
I        specified; otherwise, it is optional, but it must be the same
I        record format that was specified when recovery was initiated
I        for the data.
N
D      rec-len, +
I        The record length, in bytes. It must be a positive numeric
I        value between 10 and 32760, inclusive. For variable record
I        format, this is the maximum record length. This parameter is
I        required when recovery-request = NO or is not specified;
I        otherwise, it is optional, but it must be the same record
I        length that was specified when recovery was initiated for the
I        data.
N
D      read-routine, +
I        A fullword address indicating the entry point of a
I        dialog-supplied read routine (required). It is recommended that
I        the high-order bit of this value be set ON. See "Read routine"
I        in the manual for more information about this parameter.
N
D      write-routine | 'b', +
I        A fullword address indicating the entry point of a
I        dialog-supplied write routine (required). It is recommended
I        that the high-order bit of this value be set ON. See "Write
I        routine" in the manual for more information about this
I        parameter.
N
D      cmd-routine | 'b', +
I        A fullword address indicating the entry point of a
I        dialog-supplied routine that processes the MOVE, COPY, CREATE,
I        REPLACE, and EDIT primary commands. It is recommended that the
I        high-order bit of this value be set ON. See "Command routine"
I        in the manual for more information about this parameter. If
I        this parameter is not specified, ISPF processes these commands.
N
D      dialog-data | 'b', +
I        A fullword address indicating the beginning of a dialog data
I        area. This address is passed to the dialog-supplied routines.
I        If no address is supplied, zeros are passed to the dialog
I        routines. This data area provides a communication area for the
I        dialog.
N
D      edif_len | 'b', +
I        The length, in bytes, of the data to be displayed for editing.
I        This parameter indicates that the data records should be
I        considered to have a length shorter than rec-len during
I        editing. Thus, the dialog may include data in the record that
I        is not accessible for editing.
N
I        Edit-len must be a numeric value between 10 and 32760,
I        inclusive, and must be less than or equal to parameter rec-len.
I        Rec-len is the default. If the edit-len parameter is specified,
I        the data that is not displayed are the bytes from (edit-len +1)
I        to rec-len. That means the inaccessible record data is at the
I        end of the record.
N
I        The edit-len parameter is optional when recovery-request = NO
I        or is not specified; otherwise, it is not allowed. The
I        edit-len parameter is not allowed when format-name is
I        specified.
N
D      panel-name | 'b', +
I        The name of the panel to use for displaying the data. This
I        parameter is optional when recovery-request = NO or is not
I        specified; otherwise, it is not allowed. The default is the
I        standard Edit data display panel. See GC19-3623-30
I        (f54PC00_v2r3.pdf) z/OS ISPF Planning and Customizing for
I        information about developing a customized panel.

M        and Reference Chapter 6 and Chapter 7 have the details you want
M        for defining a panel.
N
D      macro-name | 'b', +
I        The name of the initial macro to be executed. This parameter
I        is optional when recovery-request = NO or is not specified;
I        otherwise, it is not allowed. The default is no initial macro.
I        See SC19-3621-30 (f54em00_v2r3.pdf) z/OS ISPF Edit and Edit
I        Macros for more information on macros.
N
D      format-name | 'b', +
I        The name of the format to be used to reformat the data. This
I        parameter is optional when recovery-request = NO or is not
I        specified; otherwise, it is not allowed. The default is no
I        format. This parameter is provided to support the IBM 5550
I        terminal using the Double-Byte Character Set (DBCS). This
I        parameter is not allowed when the edit-len parameter is
I        specified.
N
D      'NObbbbb' | 'YESbbbb' | 'b', /* (mixed-mode) */ +
I        Specifies whether the data is treated as mixed-mode DBCS data.
I        This parameter is optional when recovery-request = NO or is
I        not specified; otherwise, it is not allowed. If YES is
I        specified, the EDIF service treats the data as mixed-mode DBCS
I        data. If NO (the default) is specified, the data is treated as
I        EBCDIC (single-byte) data. This parameter is provided to
I        support the IBM 5550 terminal using the Double-Byte Character
I        Set (DBCS).
N
D      'NObbbbb' | 'YESbbbb' | 'b', /* (recovery-request) */ +
I        Specifies whether to process a pending edit recovery that was
I        being edited with the EDIF service when a system failure
I        occurred. If YES is specified, the edit recovery should
I        proceed. This function is similar to the EDREC service with the
I        PROCESS option. If YES is specified to process the edit
I        recovery, you must specify the read routine and write routine,
I        but you must not specify profile name, edit-len, panel-name,
I        macro-name, format-name and mixed-mode. If NO is specified, no
I        edit recovery is processed; EDIF edits the specified data.
N
D      parm-var | 'b', +
I        The name of an ISPF variable that contains parameters which are
I        to be passed to the initial macro specified by macro-name. The
I        variable value must not exceed 200 bytes in length. If no macro
I        name is specified, parm-var must be blank or not specified.
N
D      table-name | 'b'
I        The name of a user line command table to be used for the edit
I        session. The value must be 8 characters, blank padded.

D  call_edif_rc = RC
D  SELECT
D    WHEN (call_edif_rc = 0) THEN DO
D      /* Normal completion. */
D      NOP
D    END
D    WHEN (call_edif_rc = 4) THEN DO
D      /* Normal completion, data not saved. */
D      SAY "Ask your programmer to use SETMSG to show data not saved."
D    END
D    WHEN (call_edif_rc = 16) THEN DO
D      /* Unexpected return code received from a dialog-supplied
D         routine. When an unexpected return code is received, the EDIF
D         service terminates immediately with a return code of 16. */
D      SAY "Ask your programmer to fix the the failing" ,
D        "dialog-supplied routine."
D    END
D    WHEN (call_edif_rc = 20) THEN DO
D      /* Severe error; unable to continue. */
D      SAY "Ask your programmer to fix the logic."
D    END
