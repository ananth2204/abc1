N=========================
NChapter 3. Keyword instructions
N-------------------------------
NA keyword instruction is one or more clauses, the first of which
Nstarts with a keyword that identifies the instruction. Some keyword
Ninstructions affect the flow of control, while others provide services
Nto the programmer. Some keyword instructions, like DO, can include
Nnested instructions.
N
NInstructions
N------------
N ADDRESS:   temporarily or permanently changes the destination of
N            commands.
N ARG:       retrieves the argument strings provided to a program or
N            internal routine and assigns them to variables.
N CALL:      calls a routine (if you specify name) or controls the
N            trapping of certain conditions (if you specify ON or OFF).
N DO:        groups instructions together and optionally processes them
N            repetitively.
N DROP:      'unassigns' variables, that is, restores them to their
N            original uninitialized state.
N EXIT:      leaves a program unconditionally.
N IF:        conditionally processes an instruction or group of
N            instructions depending on the evaluation of the
N            expression.
N INTERPRET: processes instructions that have been built dynamically
N            by evaluating expression.
N ITERATE:   alters the flow within a repetitive DO loop (that is, any
N            DO construct other than that with a simple DO).
N LEAVE:     causes an immediate exit from one or more repetitive DO
N            loops (that is, any DO construct other than a simple DO).
N NOP:       is a dummy instruction that has no effect.
N NUMERIC:   changes the way in which a program carries out arithmetic
N            operations.
N OPTIONS:   passes special requests or parameters to the language
N            processor.
N PARSE:     assigns data (from various sources) to one or more
N            variables according to the rules of parsing
N PROCEDURE: within an internal routine (subroutine or function),
N            protects variables by making them unknown to the
N            instructions that fall outside of it.
N PULL:      reads a string from the head of the external data queue.
N PUSH:      stacks the string resulting from the evaluation of
N            expression at the head of the external data queue. That is,
N            it is added FIFO (First In, First Out) onto the external
N            data queue.
N QUEUE:     appends the string resulting from expression to the tail
N            of the external data queue. That is, it is added
N            LILO (Last In, Last Out).
N RETURN:    returns control (and possibly a result) from a REXX
N            program or internal routine to the point of its
N            invocation.
N SAY:       writes a line to the output stream.
N SELECT:    conditionally calls one of several alternative
N            instructions.
N SIGNAL:    causes an unusual change in the flow of control (if you
N            specify labelname or VALUE expression), or controls the
N            trapping of certain conditions (if you specify ON or OFF).
N TRACE:     controls the tracing action (that is, how much is
N            displayed to the user) during processing of a REXX
N            program.
N UPPER:     translates the contents of one or more variables to
N            uppercase.
