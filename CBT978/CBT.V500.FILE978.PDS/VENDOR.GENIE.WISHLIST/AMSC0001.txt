NChapter 0. Preface
N------------------
NHow to code access method services commands
N-------------------------------------------
NAll access method services commands have the following general
Nstructure:
N
N  COMMAND parameters ... Ýterminator¨
N
N  The command defines the type of service requested. The parameters
N  further describe the service requested. The terminator indicates the
N  end of the command statement.
N
N  Commands: Commands can begin at, or to the right of, the left margin.
N  For batch processing jobs, the default margins are 2 and 72.
N
N  Commands are separated from their parameters by one or more
N  separators (blanks, commas, or comments). For some parameters,
N  parentheses are used as separators. Comments are strings of
N  characters surrounded by /* and */. Comments can contain any
N  characters except */.
N
NPositional and keyword parameters
N---------------------------------
NA parameter can either be a positional parameter or a keyword
Nparameter.
N
NPositional parameters must always appear first in a parameter set.
NIn access method services, positional parameters are never optional.
N
NA keyword parameter is a specific character string that can have a
Nvalue following it.
N
N  A keyword parameter can have a set of subparameters. Subparameters
N  follow the same rules as parameter sets in general. When the
N  subparameters are positional, the first subparameter is always
N  required.
N
NHow to code subparameters
N-------------------------
NYou can use decimal (n), hexadecimal (X'n'), or binary (B'n') form to
Ndefine parameters.
N
NThese coding conventions apply to the subparameters in this section:
N
N-> When the subparameter contains a special character, enclose the
N   subparameter in single quotation marks; for example, OWNER('*IBM*').
N
N-> When the subparameter contains a special character and a single
N   quotation mark, code the embedded quotation mark as two single
N   quotation marks; for example, VOLUMES('one' '&').
N
N-> When you code the subparameter in hexadecimal form, two hexadecimal
N   characters represent one alphanumeric or special character. For
N   example, FROMKEY(X'C1C2C3') is the same as FROMKEY(ABC). When you
N   code a character string in hexadecimal, use an even number of
N   hexadecimal characters because it will be justified to the right.
N
N-> When the subparameter contains a lowercase alphabetic character,
N   it is changed to an uppercase alphabetic character.
N
NHow to continue commands and parameters
N---------------------------------------
NCommands can be continued on several records or lines. Except for the
Nlast line, each record or line must have a hyphen or a plus sign as
Nthe last nonblank character before, or at, the right margin.
N
NA hyphen continues the command. A plus sign continues both the command
Nand a value within the command.
N
NThe terminator
N--------------
NThe terminator ends the command, and can be either a semicolon or the
Nabsence of a continuation mark.
N
NIf you use the semicolon as the terminator, do not close it in
Nquotation marks or embed it in a comment. Everything to the right of
Nthe semicolon is ignored.
