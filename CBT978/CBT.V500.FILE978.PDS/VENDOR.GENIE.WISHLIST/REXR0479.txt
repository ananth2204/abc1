NSYSCPUS
N-------
NSYSCPUS places, in a stem variable, information about those CPUs that
Nare online.
N
NThe number of online CPUs is returned in variable cpus_stem.0. The
Nserial numbers of each of those CPUs are returned in variables whose
Nnames are derived by appending a number (1 through cpus_stem.0) to the
Nstem. Trailing blanks are removed. The serial number is obtained from
Nthe field PCCACPID in the MVS control block IHAPCCA. On a z990 machine
Nor later, all CPU numbers are identical; therefore, SYSCPUS returns
Nthe same value for all CPUs.
N
N
NSyntax:
D  SYSCPUS(cpus_stem)
I    cpus_stem: The name of a stem variable where you want to capture
I               the serial and model numbers.
N
N
NExample
N-------
I  syscpus_rc = SysCPUs("CPUS.")
I
I  Say "RC =" syscpus_rc
I  Say "0 = Function performed okay:"
I  Say "4 = CPU vary was occurring at the time the function was used."
I  Say "Number of on-line CPs:" cpus.0
I  Say "If you follow control blocks IHAPCCA->PCCACPID = serial number."
I  Say "z990 and newer machines will show the same serial number",
I    "for all CPs."
I  Do loop_ctr = 1 To cpus.0
I    Parse Var cpus.loop_ctr,
I      cp_serial +6,
I      cp_model
I    Say "CP#"loop_ctr "- Model("cp_model") Serial("cp_serial")"
I  End
* End of WISH.
