NChapter 27. SESSIONS resources
N------------------------------
NA SESSIONS resource defines the logical link between two CICS systems
Nthat communicate using intersystem communication (ISC) or multiregion
Noperation (MRO).
N
NBefore two systems can communicate using , they must be logically
Nlinked through one or more sessions. The nature of the logical link
Ndetermines how they can communicate. CICS does not use the SESSIONS
Nname when the definition has been installed in the active system. This
Nname is used only to identify the definition in the CSD file.
N
NYou use the CONNECTION attribute of the SESSIONS resource to name the
NCONNECTION with which these SESSIONS are associated when they are
Ninstalled in the active systems.
