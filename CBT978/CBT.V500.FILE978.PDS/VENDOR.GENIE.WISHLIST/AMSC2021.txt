NThe LISTCAT parameters are:
N---------------------------
N-> ENTRIES(GDG01): specifies that the entries named GDG01 be listed.
N   Because GDG01 is a generation data group entry, its associated
N   generation data set's (non-VSAM) entries are also listed. If one of
N   the generation data sets has aliases, the alias entries associated
N   with the generation data set's entry are also listed.
n
N-> ALL: specifies that all fields are to be listed.
n
NThe first DELETE parameters are:
N--------------------------------
M-> GDG01: a generic name, identifies all generation data set entries
M    with two levels in the name and the high-level qualifier GDG01.
N
M-> NONVSAM: ensures the entries are the desired type.
N
NThe second DELETE parameters are:
N---------------------------------
N-> GDG01: is the entryname of the object being deleted. GDG01
N   identifies the generation data group base entry.
N
N-> GENERATIONDATAGROUP: specifies the type of entry being deleted. AMS
N   verifies that GDG01 is a generation data group entry, then deletes
N   it. If GDG01 incorrectly specifies another type of entry, AMS does
N   not delete the entry, but notes the discrepancy with a message to
N   the programmer.
