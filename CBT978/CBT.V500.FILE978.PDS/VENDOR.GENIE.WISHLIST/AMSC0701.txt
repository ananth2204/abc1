I      must have access to RACF FACILITY class profile
I      STGADMIN.IGG.LIBRARY.
N
NOptional parameters
N-------------------

D    MOUNTDATE(mountdate) /* Abbreviation: MDATE */ -
I      The date on which the tape volume was last mounted onto a tape
I      drive and successfully opened.

N
I      UNKNOWN :Tape recording technique is unknown.
N
D    SHELFLOCATION(shelf) /* Abbreviation: SHELFLOC */ -

I      a tape library. This parameter can be included for a library
I      resident volume.
N
I      shelf: The 1-to-32 character shelf location information field.
I        If your description contains commas, semicolons, embedded
I        blanks, parentheses, or slashes, enclose the entire description

N
D    SPECIALATTRIBUTE( /* Abbreviation: SATTR */ -
D     READCOMPATIBLE | NONE -
D    ) -
I      Shows special attributes of the tape volume. Use this parameter
I      only for private tape volumes. Scratch tape volumes default to
I      NONE.

I      Identifies the storage group name.
N
I      groupname: The 1-to-8 character name of the storage group in
I        which this tape volume is defined. The default is blanks. If
I        the USEATTRIBUTE parameter is SCRATCH, however, the storage
I        group name defaults to *SCRTCH*.
N
D    USEATTRIBUTE( /* Abbreviation: UATTR */ -
D     SCRATCH | PRIVATE -
D    ) -
I      Identifies the use attribute of a tape volume. You can use
I      SCRATCH for scratch volumes, or PRIVATE for private volumes
I      (tape volumes with unexpired data sets on them). The default is
I      PRIVATE. If you use SCRATCH, the storage group name is set to
I      *SCRTCH* and the expiration date is set to blanks.

D    WRITEPROTECT | NOWRITEPROTECT /* Abbreviations: WPRT and NWPRT */
I      Identifies whether the tape volume is write-protected or not. If
I      you do not use this, write-protect status is unknown.
N
I      WRITEPROTECT: Indicates that the volume is write-protected.
N
I        Setting WRITEPROTECT in the tape volume entry does not
I        automatically write protect your volume. It is an informational
I        setting that is recorded when software detects that the volume
I        is write protected and is not used by software when determining
I        whether the volume is protected. For a volume to be write
I        protected, you will still need to set the write protect tab
I        available on the physical tape volume. Because the availability
I        to write protect a volume does not exist for logical volumes
I        in a VTS, (no tab available either physically or logically),
I        you can alternately use RACF or PROTECT=ALL in your JCL to
I        protect the volume during usage.
N
I      NOWRITEPROTECT: Indicates that the volume is not write-protected.
