NChapter 3. DFSMS tools for data and storage management
N------------------------------------------------------
NDFSMSdfp provides several types of tools for system programmers and
Ndatabase administrators to use to manage the organization and storage
Nof data in the z/OS environment.
N
NWith DFSMS tools, you can use access methods with macro instructions
Nto organize and process a data set or object; use access method
Nservices commands to manage data sets, volumes, and catalogs; use
Nutilities to perform tasks such as copying or moving data. You also
Ncan use system commands to display and set SMS configuration
Nparameters, callable services to write advanced application programs,
Nand installation exits to customize DFSMS.

NDFSMSdfp callable services
N
N  IGWABWO: Retrieves or sets data set indicators. For example, your
N           program can determine if a data set can be backed up while
N           it is open for update.
N
N  IGWARLS: Obtains information about the record-level sharing
N           attributes for a VSAM data set.
N
N  IGWASMS: Determines if a data set is system-managed, and returns the
N           SMS class names and data set type.
N
N  IGWASYS: Determines the version, release, and modification level of
N           DFSMS and the status of the SMS subsystem.
N
N  IGWLSHR: Determines the DFSMSdfp share attributes currently in use
N           on the system.
