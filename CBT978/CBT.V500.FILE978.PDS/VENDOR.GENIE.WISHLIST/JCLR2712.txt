I   message: What it is you wish to convey.
N
NRelationship to the /*ROUTE XEQ Statement
N-----------------------------------------
NIf the /*MESSAGE statement is in a job that also contains a
NJES2 /*ROUTE XEQ statement:
N
N->Placing the /*MESSAGE statement before the /*ROUTE XEQ statement
N  directs JES2 to send the message to the operators at the input node
N  and the execution node.
N
N->Placing the /*MESSAGE statement after the /*ROUTE XEQ statement
N  directs JES2 to send the message only to the operator at the
N  execution node.

MLike most shops, yours probably has way too many messages streaming
Mby on the console for any HUMAN to really see this. Pick up the
Mtelephone and call them.
* End of WISH.
