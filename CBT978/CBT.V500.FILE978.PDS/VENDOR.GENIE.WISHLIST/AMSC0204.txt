NIF-THEN-ELSE Command Sequence
N-----------------------------
NThe syntax of the IF-THEN-ELSE command sequence, which controls
Ncommand execution, is:
N
D  IF LASTCC | MAXCC operator number -
D    THEN DO
D      command set
D    END
D  ELSE DO
D    command set
D  END
N
Nwhere:
N
N  IF: States that one or more functional commands should run based
N    on a test of a condition code. A SET command sets the condition
N    code, or the condition code reflects the completion status of
N    previous functional commands.
N
N    Nested IF commands: When an IF command appears within a THEN or
N    ELSE clause, it is called a nested IF command. To see an example
N    of a nested IF command, see Using Nested IF Commands, Example 1.
N
N    -> The maximum level of nesting allowed is 10, starting with the
N       first IF.
N
N    -> Within a nest of IF commands:
N
N-    > The innermost ELSE clause is associated with the innermost THEN
N       clause,
N
N    -> The next innermost ELSE clause with the next innermost THEN
N       clause, and so on. (Each ELSE is matched with the nearest
N       preceding unmatched THEN.)
N
N    -> If there is an IF command that does not require an ELSE clause,
N       follow the THEN clause with a null ELSE clause (ELSE) unless the
N       nesting structure does not require one.
N
N  LASTCC: LASTCC specifies that the condition code resulting from the
N    preceding function command be compared, as indicated by the
N    operator, to the number that follows the operator to determine if
N    the THEN action is to be done.
N
N  MAXCC: MAXCC specifies that the maximum condition code value
N    established by any previous function command or by a SET command
N    be compared, as indicated by the operator, to the number following
N    the operator to determine if the THEN action is to be done.
N
N  operator: operator requires a comparison to be made between the
N    variable and number.
N
N    There are six possible comparisons:
N
N      Equal to, written as = or EQ
N
N      Not equal to, written as ,= or NE
N
N      Greater than, written as > or GT
N
N      Less than, written as < or LT
N
N      Greater than or equal to, written as >= or GE
N
N      Less than or equal to, written as <= or LE
N
N  number: number is the decimal integer that the program compares to
N    MAXCC or LASTCC. Access method services initializes both LASTCC
N    and MAXCC to zero upon entry. See "Condition Codes" for the
N    meaning of condition codes.
N
N  THEN: THEN states that a single command or a group of commands
N    (introduced by DO) is to be run if the comparison is true. THEN
N    can be followed by another IF command.
N
N  ELSE: ELSE specifies that a single command or a group of commands
N    (introduced by DO) is to be run if the previous comparison is
N    false. ELSE can be followed by another IF command.
N
NUsing Nested IF Commands: Example 1
N-----------------------------------
NIn this example, nested IF commands are used to determine whether or
Nnot a REPRO, DELETE, or PRINT command is run.
N
I  IF LASTCC > 4 -
I    THEN IF MAXCC < 12 -
I      THEN REPRO...
I      ELSE DELETE...
I    ELSE IF LASTCC = 4 -
I    THEN
I    ELSE PRINT...
N
NIf LASTCC is greater than 4, MAXCC is tested. If MAXCC is less
Nthan 12, the REPRO command is run; if the value of MAXCC is 12
Nor greater, the DELETE command is run instead. If the value of
NLASTCC is 4 or less, LASTCC is tested for being exactly 4; if it is,
Nthe program takes no action. If LASTCC is less than 4, the program
Nruns the PRINT command.
N
NUsing Nested IF Commands: Example 2
N-----------------------------------
NIn this example, nested IF commands are used to determine whether the
Nprogram should run a REPRO command or a PRINT command.
N
I  IF LASTCC > 4 -
I    THEN IF MAXCC < 12 -
I      THEN REPRO ...
I      ELSE
I    ELSE IF LASTCC = 4 -
I      THEN PRINT ...
N
NIf LASTCC is greater than 4, and MAXCC is 12 or greater, no
Nfunctional commands are run. Use the null ELSE command to indicate
Nthat the next ELSE is to correspond to the first THEN.
* End of WISH.
