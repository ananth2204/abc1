NChapter 10. TSO/E REXX commands
N-------------------------------
NEXECUTIL
N--------
NEXECUTIL lets you change various characteristics that control how an
Nexec processes in the TSO/E address space.
N
NAll of the EXECUTIL operands are mutually exclusive, that is, you can
Nonly specify one of the operands on the command.
N
N
NSyntax
D  EXECUTIL EXECDD(CLOSE | NOCLOSE) TS | TE | HT | RT | HI +
D    RENAME NAME(function-name) SYSNAME(sys-name) DD(sys-dd) +
D    SEARCHDD(NO | YES)
N
I    EXECDD(CLOSE) or EXECDD(NOCLOSE): Specifies whether the system
I      exec library is to be closed after the system locates the exec
I      but before the exec runs.
N
I    TS: Use TS (Trace Start) to start tracing execs. Tracing lets you
I        interactively control the processing of an exec and debug
I        problems.
N
I    TE: Use TE (Trace End) to end tracing execs. The TE operand is not
I        really applicable in READY mode because an exec is not
I        currently running. However, if you issued EXECUTIL TS to trace
I        the next exec you invoke and then issued EXECUTIL TE, the next
I        exec you invoke is not traced.
N
I    HT: Use HT (Halt Typing) to suppress terminal output generated by
I        an exec. The exec continues running. HT suppresses any output
I        generated by REXX instructions or functions (for example, the
I        SAY instruction) and REXX informational messages. REXX error
I        messages are still displayed. Normal terminal output resumes
I        when the exec completes. You can also use EXECUTIL RT to resume
I        terminal output.
N
I    RT: Use RT (Resume Typing) to resume terminal output that was
I        previously suppressed. Use the RT operand in either an exec
I        or CLIST. You can also use EXECUTIL RT from a program by using
I        the TSO service facility. If the program invokes EXECUTIL RT,
I        terminal output from all execs that are currently running is
I        resumed. EXECUTIL RT is not applicable from READY mode or ISPF
I        because no execs are currently running.
N
I    HI: Use HI (Halt Interpretation) to halt the interpretation of all
I        execs that are currently running in the language processor
I        environment. From either an exec or a CLIST, EXECUTIL HI halts
I        the interpretation of all execs that are currently running. If
I        an exec calls a CLIST and the CLIST contains EXECUTIL HI, the
I        exec that invoked the CLIST stops processing.
N
I    RENAME: Use EXECUTIL RENAME to change entries in a function package
I            directory. A function package directory contains
I            information about the functions and subroutines that make
I            up a function package.
N
I      NAME(function-name): Specifies the name of the external function
I                           or subroutine that is used in an exec. This
I                           is also the name in the func-name field in
I                           the directory entry.
I      SYSNAME(sys-name): Specifies the name of the entry point in a
I                         load module that corresponds to the package
I                         code that is called for the function or
I                         subroutine. If SYSNAME is omitted, the
I                         sys-name field in the package directory is set
I                         to blanks.
I      DD(sys-dd): Specifies the name of the DD from which the package
I                  code is loaded. If DD is omitted, the sys-dd field
I                  in the package directory is set to blanks.
N
I    SEARCHDD(YES/NO): Specifies whether the system exec library (the
I                      default is SYSEXEC) should be searched when execs
I                      are implicitly invoked. YES indicates that the
I                      system exec library (SYSEXEC) is searched, and
I                      if the exec is not found, SYSPROC is then
I                      searched.
N
I                      NO indicates that SYSPROC only is searched.

NExample EXECUTIL
N----------------
I  /* REXX program */
I  MAINRTN:
I    SAY "EXECUTIL IS RUNNING."
I    CALL SUBRTN
I    "EXECUTIL TE"
I    SAY "EXECUTIL IS STILL RUNNING."
I    EXIT
I  /* Subroutine follows */
I  SUBRTN:
I    SAY "EXECUTIL SUBRTN IS RUNNING."
I    "EXECUTIL TS"
I    SAY "EXECUTIL SUBRTN IS STILL RUNNING."
I    RETURN
* End of WISH.
