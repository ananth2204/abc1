NChapter 10: The Generalized Trace Facility (GTF)
N------------------------------------------------
NReceiving GTF traces
N--------------------
NGTF writes trace data in GTF trace tables in the GTF address space in
Nstorage. GTF trace data in storage are printed or viewed as part of a
Ndump, if the dump options list includes TRT to request trace data. The
Nfollowing table shows the dumps that have TRT in their default options.
NFor unformatted dumps that are printed or viewed through IPCS, format
Nthe trace data by specifying the IPCS GTFTRACE subcommand or using the
NIPCS Trace Processing selection panel.
N
NTo format and print GTF trace data in a GTFOUTxx or IEFRDER data set,
Nspecify the IPCS GTFTRACE subcommand or use the IPCS Trace Processing
Nselection panel.
N
NIf the GTF data was created for VTAM diagnosis, you can use the ACF/TAP
Nprogram to format the VTAM data.

NCombining, extracting, and merging GTF trace output
N---------------------------------------------------
NGTF trace data can be combined with other data or extracted from dumps
Nand data sets using two IPCS subcommands: COPYTRC and MERGE.
