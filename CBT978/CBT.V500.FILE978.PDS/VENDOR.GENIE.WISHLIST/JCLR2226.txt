N====================
NDATACK Parameter
N----------------
NUse the DATACK parameter to indicate whether or not print-positioning
Nand invalid-character data-check errors are to be blocked or unblocked
Nfor printers accessed through the Print Services Facility (PSF)
Nfunctional subsystem.
N
NA print-positioning error occurs when the designated position of any
Nkind of printable information is beyond the limits of either the
Nphysical page, or the overlay or logical page of which it is part.
N
NAn invalid-character data-check error occurs when the hexadecimal
Nrepresentation of a text character has no mapping in the code page to
Na member of the font raster patterns.
N
NIf an error type is unblocked, the printer reports the error at the end
Nof the page in which it occurs, and PSF processes the error and
Ngenerates an error message. (See the PIMSG parameter for more
Ninformation on the printing of error messages.)
N
NIf an error type is blocked, the printer does not report the error to
NPSF. Printing continues but data may be lost on the output.

D//outds OUTPUT DATACK={BLOCK | UNBLOCK | BLKCHAR | BLKPOS}
I                 BLOCK: Indicates that print-positioning errors and
I                   invalid-character errors are not reported to PSF.
I                 UNBLOCK: Indicates that print-positioning errors and
I                   invalid-character errors are reported to PSF.
I                 BLKCHAR: Indicates that invalid-character errors are
I                   blocked, and not reported to PSF. Print-positioning
I                   errors are reported normally.
I                 BLKPOS: Indicates that print-positioning errors are
I                   blocked, and not reported to PSF. Invalid-character
I                   errors are reported normally.
N
NExample 1: Report posiiton errors, block invalid-character errors.
N------------------------------------------------------------------
NIn this example, when a print-position error occurs, it is reported to
Nthe user via a printed error message. If an invalid-character error
Noccurs, it is not reported. In either case, the printing of the data
Nset continues, and all functional subsystem messages are printed.
N
D//OUTDS OUTPUT DATACK=BLKCHAR,PIMSG=(YES,0)
M
MPIMSG=(YES,0) specifies 0 to print an infinite number of errors.
