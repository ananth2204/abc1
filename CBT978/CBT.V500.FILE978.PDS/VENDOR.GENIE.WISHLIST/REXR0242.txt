N=========================
NChapter 2. REXX general concepts
N--------------------------------
N  Commands to external environments
N  ---------------------------------
N    Commands
N    --------
NTo send a command to the currently addressed host command environment,
Nuse a clause of the form:
N
D  command parameters;
N
NThe expression is evaluated, resulting in a character string (which
Ncan be the null string), which is then prepared as appropriate and
Nsubmitted to the host command environment. Any part of the expression
Nnot to be evaluated should be enclosed in quotation marks.
M
MQutotation marks can be either the apostrophe (') or quote(").
N
NThe environment then processes the command, which might have
Nside-effects. It eventually returns control to the language processor,
Nafter setting a return code. A return code is a string, typically a
Nnumber, that returns some information about the command that has been
Nprocessed. A return code usually indicates if a command was successful
Nor not but can also represent other information. The language
Nprocessor places this return code in the REXX special variable RC.
N
NIn addition to setting a return code, the underlying system might also
Nindicate to the language processor if an error or failure occurred.
NAn error is a condition raised by a command for which a program that
Nuses that command would usually be expected to be prepared. (For
Nexample, a locate command to an editing system might report requested
Nstring not found as an error.) A failure is a condition raised by a
Ncommand for which a program that uses that command would not usually
Nbe expected to recover (for example, a command that is not executable
Nor cannot be found).
N
MRecommendation: Whenever you use a host command in a REXX program,
Menclose the command using the quote (").
N
N
NExample 1: TSO Command (recommended)
N------------------------------------
NExplicitly uses high level qualifier PROGA and why using the quote
Nis recommended as the apostrophe (') wraps a data set name.
D  Address TSO "FREE DATASET('PROGA.LOAD')"
N
NExample 2: TSO Command (not recommended)
N----------------------------------------
NAssumes the high level qualifier matches your PREFIX().
I  Address TSO "FREE DATASET(PROGA.LOAD)"
N
NExample 3: TSO Command (not recommended)
N----------------------------------------
NExplicitly uses high level qualifier PROGA and why using the
Napostrophe is cumbersome. It takes two to get one.
I  Address TSO 'FREE DATASET('''PROGA.LOAD''')'
N
NExample 4: MVS Command
* End of WISH.
