NChapter 36. WEBSERVICE resources
N--------------------------------
NA WEBSERVICE resource defines aspects of the run time environment for
Na CICS application program deployed in a web services setting, where
Nthe mapping between application data structure and SOAP messages has
Nbeen generated using the CICS web services assistant. Although CICS
Nprovides the usual resource definition mechanisms for WEBSERVICE
Nresources, they are typically installed dynamically, using the output
Nproduced by the assistant.
N
NThe aspects of the run time environment that are defined by the
NWEBSERVICE resource are:
N
NA pipeline
N----------
NDefines the set of message handlers that operate on web service
Nrequests and responses. The WEBSERVICE resource specifies a separate
NPIPELINE resource which, in turn, specifies the pipeline configuration
Nfile.
N
NA web service binding file
N--------------------------
NContains information that is used at run time to perform the mapping
Nbetween application data structures and SOAP messages. The web service
Nbinding file is generated by the CICS-supplied tools.
N
NA web service description
N-------------------------
NThe web services description is used only when runtime validation of
NSOAP messages is required. Validation of each message is performed
Nagainst its schema, which is imbedded within the web service
Ndescription.
