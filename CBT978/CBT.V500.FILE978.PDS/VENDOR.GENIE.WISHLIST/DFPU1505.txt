NExample 5: Rename a Data Set and Define New Passwords
N-----------------------------------------------------
NIn this example, a data set is renamed. The data set passwords assigned
Nto the old data set name are deleted. Then two passwords are assigned
Nto the new data set name. If the data set is not cataloged, a message
Nis issued indicating that the LOCATE macro instruction ended
Nunsuccessfully.

NThe utility control statements are discussed below:
N
N  RENAME specifies that the data set called OLD is renamed NEW. The
N  operator is required to supply a password to rename the old data set.
N
N  DELETEP specifies that the entry for the password KEY is deleted.
N  Because KEY is a control password in this example, all the password
N  entries for the data set name are deleted. The VOL parameter is not
N  needed because the protection status of the data set as set in the
N  DSCB is not to be changed; read/write protection is presently set in
N  the DSCB, and read/write protection is desired when the passwords are
N  reassigned under the new data set name.
N
N  The ADD statements specify that entries are added for passwords KEY
N  and READ. KEY becomes the control password and allows both read and
N  write access to the data set. READ becomes a secondary password and
N  allows only read access to the data set. The VOL parameter is not
N  needed, because the protection status of the data set is still set in
N  the DSCB.
