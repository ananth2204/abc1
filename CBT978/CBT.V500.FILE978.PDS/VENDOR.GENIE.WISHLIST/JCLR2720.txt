NJES2 Control Statement
N======================
NJECL /*SIGNON Statement
N-----------------------
NUse the /*SIGNON statement to tell JES2 to begin a remote job stream
Nprocessing session. For non-multi-leaving remote stations, the
Nterminal transmits the /*SIGNON statement alone as part of the initial
Nconnection process.
N
D/*SIGNON dest Ýpassword1¨ Ýnew-password¨ Ýpassword2¨
I    dest: Specifies the name (one through eight characters) that you
I      use to refer to the JES2-defined destination. The dest-name must
I      be defined as a remote work station on the system to which the
I      terminal is connected.
I
I         {REMOTEnnn}
I         {RMTnnnn }
I         {RMnnnn }
I         {Rnnnn }
I         {NxxRnnnn }
I         {dest-name}
I
I    password1: Specifies the password assigned to a nondedicated
I      connection that allows the remote station access to JES2 for
I      remote job stream processing. The installation assigns this
I      password during system initialization. The operator can change
I      or delete this password with the $T command.
I
I    new-password: Specifies a new password for the remote job entry
I      (RJE) station that is signing on. If the installation is
I      controlling the sign on with JES2 password support instead of
I      RACF, the new password is ignored.
I
I    password2: Specifies the current password for the remote station
I      that is signing on; this password identifies the remote station
I      as a valid remote job entry (RJE) station. This parameter is
I      assigned by either RACF, a JES2 initialization parameter (if JES2
I      password support is used), or the $T command.
