NThe JCL statements are:
N-----------------------
N-> SOURCE DD: describes the portable file, CATBACK.TESTDSNS(-1), which
N   resides on a magnetic tape file that is not mounted by the
N   operator until access method services opens SOURCE for processing.
N
NThe IMPORT parameters are:
N--------------------------
N-> INFILE: points to the SOURCE DD statement.
N
N-> OUTDATASET: gives the name of the catalog being imported. Access
N   method services dynamically allocates the catalog.
N
N-> ALIAS: specifies that aliases that already exist in the master
N   catalog for MCAT.PRODSYS are to be preserved and that the aliases
N   on the portable file are to be listed. However, if MCAT.PRODSYS
N   had not existed in the system when importing, the aliases on the
N   portable file would have been defined in MCAT.PRODSYS.
N
N-> LOCK: specifies that the catalog being imported is locked.
N
N-> CATALOG: identifies the master catalog, ICFMAST1.
