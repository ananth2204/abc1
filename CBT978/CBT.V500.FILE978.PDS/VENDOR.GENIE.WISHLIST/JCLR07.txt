NChapter 7. Started Tasks
N------------------------
NThis chapter describes the decisions your system programmer needs to
Nmake in order for your installation to use started tasks, and the steps
Na person with operator authority (the "you" in this chapter ) will need
Nto perform if the decision is to use started tasks.
M
MKenneth Tomiak remark:
MThe "you" is very unlikely to be YOU. The target audience of the JCL
MReference manual is Application Developers/Programmers, System
MProgrammers/Administrators/Engineers, and the generically titled
MProduction Control/Job Scheduler team.
M
MThe role of the Computer Operator (a person with operator authority)
Mhas typically been automated using Automation Operation and Job
MScheduling software. That is now the de-facto standard method for the
Mstarting of system task control (STC) and for the submission of JOBs.
