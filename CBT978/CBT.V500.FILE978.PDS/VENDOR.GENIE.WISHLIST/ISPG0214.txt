NChapter 2. Description of the ISPF services
N-------------------------------------------
NFTCLOSE-End file tailoring
N--------------------------
NThe FTCLOSE service is used to terminate the file tailoring process and
Nto indicate the final disposition of the file tailoring output.
N
NA member-name parameter should be specified if the output is a library.
NThe file tailoring output is given the specified member name. No error
Ncondition results if the member-name parameter is not specified and the
Noutput is not stored in the library.
N
NIf the member-name parameter is specified and the output is sequential,
Na severe error results.
N
NThe library parameter should be specified if a library other than that
Nrepresented by the ISPFILE or LIBDEF definition is to be used. The
Nlibrary parameter is ignored if the "TEMP" option (temporary file) is
Nspecified on the FTOPEN service or if the ISPFILE definition specifies
Na sequential data set. A severe error occurs if file tailoring attempts
Nto use a data set that is not a library.
N
NThe NOREPL parameter specifies that an existing member in the file
Ntailoring output library is not to be overlaid by the current FTCLOSE
Nservice. If a member of the same name already exists, the FTCLOSE
Nservice request is terminated with a return code of 4 and the original
Nmember remains unaltered.
N
NCommand invocation format
N-------------------------
D  ADDRESS ISPEXEC "FTCLOSE" ,
D    "NAME(member-name)" ,
I      Specifies the name of the member in the output library that is to
I      contain the file tailoring output.
N
D    "LIBRARY(library) " ,
I      Specifies the name of a DD statement or lib-type on the LIBDEF
I      service request that defines the output library in which the
I      member-name exists. If specified, a generic (non-ISPF) ddname
I      must be used. If this parameter is omitted, the default is
I      ISPFILE.
N
D    "NOREPL"
I      Specifies that FTCLOSE is not to overlay an existing member in
I      the output library.
N
NReturn codes
N------------
NThese return codes are possible:
N
D  ftclose_rc = RC
D  SELECT
D    WHEN (ftclose_rc = 0) THEN DO
D      /* Normal completion. */
D      NOP
D    END
D    WHEN (ftclose_rc = 4) THEN DO
D      /* Member already exists in the output library and NOREPL was
D         specified. The original member is unchanged. */
D      SAY "Ask your programmer to handle the outcome of their choice."
D    END
D    WHEN (ftclose_rc = 8) THEN DO
D      /* File not open. FTOPEN was not used before FTCLOSE. */
D      SAY "Ask your programmer to fix the logic, FTOPEN missing."
D      SAY ZERRSM
D      SAY ZERRLM
D    END
D    WHEN (ftclose_rc = 12) THEN DO
D      /* Output file in use. ENQ failed. */
D      SAY "Ask your programmer to use a FREE file"
D      SAY ZERRSM
D      SAY ZERRLM
D    END
D    WHEN (ftclose_rc = 16) THEN DO
D      /* Skeleton library or output file not allocated. */
D      SAY "Ask your programmer to allocate a file."
D      SAY ZERRSM
D      SAY ZERRLM
D    END
D    WHEN (ftclose_rc = 20) THEN DO
D      /* Severe error. */
D      SAY "Ask your programmer to fix the severe error."
D      SAY ZERRSM
D      SAY ZERRLM
D    END
D    OTHERWISE DO
D      SAY "Something very unexpected happened, RC("ftclose_rc")."
D    END
D  END
N
NExample 1: End the file tailoring process.

I  ADDRESS ISPEXEC "FTCLOSE" ,
I    "NAME(TELOUT)"
