NProblem data for storage overlays

N
NAnalyzing the damaged area
N--------------------------
NFirst, determine the extent of the bad data. Look for EBCDIC data or
Nmodule addresses in storage to identify the owner. Any type of pattern
Nin storage can indicate an error and identify the program that is using
Nthe damaged storage. Look at the data on both sides of the
Nobviously bad areas. See if the length of the bad area is familiar;
Nthat is, can you relate the length to a known control block
Nlength, data size, MVC length? If so, check various offsets to
Ndetermine their contents and, if you recognize some, try to determine
Nthe exact control block.
N
NRepetition of a pattern can indicate a bad process. If you can
Nrecognize the bad data you might be able to relate that data to
Nthe component or module that is causing the error. This provides
Na starting point for further analysis.
