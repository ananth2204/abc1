NJES3 Control Statement Fields
N-----------------------------
NThe rules for coding JES3 control statements are the same as the rules
Nfor JCL statements, with the following additions:
N
N-> Columns 1, 2, and 3 generally contain the characters //*
N   (slash-slash-asterisk). Some JES3 control statements may contain,
N   and certain other JES3 control statements must contain only a
N   single slash-asterisk (/*) in columns 1 and 2.
N
N-> Columns 3 and 4 must not be blank.
N
N-> To code a comment on a JES3 control statement, code a blank after
N   the control statement, and end the comment before column 72.
N   Columns 73-80 are ignored by z/OS and are typically used for
N   sequence numbers.
N
M   Sequence numbers were relevant in the days of punched cards.
M   Nowadays, they can help track changes via columns 79 and 80.
