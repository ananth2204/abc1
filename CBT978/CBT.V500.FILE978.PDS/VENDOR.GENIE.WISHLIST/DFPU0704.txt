NExample 4: Build a New 3800 Forms Control Buffer Module
N-------------------------------------------------------
N3800 Model 1
N
NIn this example, the vertical spacing, channel codes, and length of a
Nform are specified, and the module is added to the SYS1.IMAGELIB data
Nset as a new member.

NThe control statements are discussed below:
N
N  The SYSUT1 DD statement includes DISP=OLD to ensure that no other
N  job can modify the data set while this job is executing.
N
N  CH1=1 specifies channel 1 code for printable line 1.
N
N  CH6=33 specifies channel 6 code for line 33.
N
N  LPI=((8,32),(12,2)) specifies that the first 32 printable lines of
N  the form are to be at a vertical spacing of 8 lines per inch, and
N  the next 2 printable lines are to be at a vertical spacing of 12
N  lines per inch.
N
N  SIZE=70 specifies that the length of the form is 70 tenths of an
N  inch, or 7 inches. Because there are 6 inches of printable lines in
N  a 7-inch form and the LPI parameter specifies 32 lines at 8 lines
N  per inch, or 4 inches, and 2 lines at 12 lines per inch, or 1/6
N  inch, the vertical spacing for the remaining 1-5/6 inches defaults
N  to 6 lines per inch.
N
N  Therefore, the form consists of lines 1 through 32 at 8 lines per
N  inch, lines 33 through 34 at 12 lines per inch, and lines 35 through
N  45 at 6 lines per inch, with channel codes at line 1 and line 33.
N
N  The name of the new FCB module is TGT; it is stored as a member of
N  the SYS1.IMAGELIB data set.
