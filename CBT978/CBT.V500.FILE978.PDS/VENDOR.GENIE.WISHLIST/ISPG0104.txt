NReturn codes from services
N--------------------------
NEach service returns a numeric code, called a return code, indicating
Nthe result of the operation. These return codes are summarized
Nin Table 1.

NTable 1. Service Return Codes
N-----------------------------
NReturn Code Operation Results   Reason
N----------- ------------------- ---------------------------------------
N    0       Normal completion   Indicates that the service completed
N                                operation without errors.
N----------- ------------------- ---------------------------------------
N   4, 8     Exception condition Indicates a condition that is not
N                                necessarily an error, but that the
N                                dialog should be aware of. A return
N                                code of 4 is informational, while an 8
N                                generally indicates a non-terminating
N                                error condition, such as the end of a
N                                data set or member list.
N----------- ------------------- ---------------------------------------
N10, 12, 14, Error condition     Indicates that the service did not
N16, 20                          complete operation because of errors.
N                                Use the CONTROL service to control
N                                errors with a return code of 12 or
N                                greater. Return codes of 10 and 14 are
N                                particular to PDF component services.

N
NReturn codes and their meanings vary for each service and are listed
Nwith each service description in this topic.
N
NCommand invocation return code variable
N---------------------------------------
NFor a command invocation, the return code is returned in the CLIST
Nvariable LASTCC.
N
NREXX invocation return code variable
N------------------------------------
NFor REXX, the return code is returned in the reserved variable RC.
N
NReturn code of 12 or higher
N
NThe dialog can use the ISPF dialog management CONTROL service to set
Nthe error mode to RETURN, or CANCEL, which is the default. See the
NCONTROL service in Chapter 2, "Description of the ISPF services," for
Ndetailed information.
N
I  ADDRESS ISPEXEC "CONTROL ERRORS CANCEL | RETURN"
N
NThe error mode setting determines what happens when a return code is
N12 or higher. There are two error modes:
N
N  CANCEL: Displays and logs a message, then stops the dialog and
N  displays the previous Primary Option Menu.
N
N  RETURN: Formats an error message, but does not display or log it.
N  Returns to the function that invoked the service, passing back the
N  designated return code.
N
NIn CANCEL mode, control is not usually returned to the function that
Ninvoked the service. Consequently, the function does not see a return
Ncode of 12 or higher, so you do not have to include logic to process
Nerrors of this severity.
N
NHowever, ISPLINK returns a code of 20 to the dialog when an invalid
NISPF environment causes the error. In this situation, ISPF cannot
Ndisplay a panel to show the error. Control is returned to the dialog,
Neven though the return code is 12 or higher.
N
NIn RETURN mode, control returns to the function that invoked the
Nservice. That function must have logic to handle return codes of 12
Nor higher.
N
NThe RETURN mode applies only to the function that invoked the CONTROL
Nservice. If a lower-level function is invoked, it starts out in CANCEL
Nmode. When a function returns to the higher-level function that invoked
Nit, the mode that the higher-level function was operating in resumes.
