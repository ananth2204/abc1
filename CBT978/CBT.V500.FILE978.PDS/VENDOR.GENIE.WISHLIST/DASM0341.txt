NGuide to z/OS utility program functions
N---------------------------------------
NAlthough z/OS utilities provide functions that are better performed
Nby newer applications, many customers continue to use these programs,
Nand IBM continues to ship them for compatibility with older supported
Nsystem levels. This guide lists the tasks for which you can use these
Nutilities, and identifies which utility is especially suited to
Nperform each task.
