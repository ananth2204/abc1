NSyntax for DIAGNOSE Parameters
N----------------------------
D  DIAGNOSE /* Abbreviation: DIAG */ -
N
NRequired Parameters
N-------------------
D    ICFCATALOG | /* Abbreviation: ICFCAT */ -
D    VVDS -
I      Specifies which data set is to be scanned for diagnosis.
N
I      You must have access authority under the RACF FACILITY class to
I      diagnose a BCS or a VVDS.
N
I      ICFCATALOG /* Abbreviation: ICFCAT */: specifies that the data
I        set to be scanned for diagnosis is the basic catalog structure
I        (BCS).
N
I      VVDS: Specifies that the data set to be scanned for diagnosis is
I        a VVDS for a catalog BCS.
N
D    INFILE(ddname) | /* Abbreviation: IFILE */ -
D    INDATASET(datasetname) /* Abbreviation: IDS */ -
I      names the DD statement or data set that specifies the data set to
I      be scanned.
N
I      Because a VVDS must be referenced by its volume serial number and
I      unit, use INFILE to specify a VVDS. A BCS can be specified by
I      either INFILE or INDATASET.
N
I      If you are authorized to the RACF FACILITY class name of
I      STGADMIN.IDC.DIAGNOSE.CATALOG, you are allowed to open a catalog
I      without performing usual catalog security processing. If you are
I      authorized to this FACILITY class name, normal RACF checking is
I      bypassed. If you try to open a catalog and you are not authorized
I      to this FACILITY class name, message IDC2918I is issued,
I      processing continues, and normal RACF checking takes place.
N
I      INFILE(ddname) /* Abbreviation: IFILE */: specifies the DD
I        statement of the data set to be scanned.
N
I      INDATASET(datasetname) /* Abbreviation: IDS */: specifies the
I        data set name of the data set to be scanned.
N
NOptional Parameters
N-------------------
D    COMPAREDD(ddname ...) | /* Abbreviation: CMPRDD */ -
D    COMPAREDS(dsname ...) /* Abbreviation: CMPRDS */ -
I      indicates which data sets are to be checked to confirm that they
I      point to the BCS or VVDS being diagnosed. Because a VVDS must be
I      referenced by its volume serial number and unit, use COMPAREDD to
I      specify a VVDS. A BCS can be specified by either COMPAREDD or
I      COMPAREDS. For diagnosis of a BCS, the compare parameters
I      identify VVDS names (you can specify a maximum of 99 names). When
I      diagnosing a VVDS, these parameters identify appropriate BCS data
I      sets.
N
I      If COMPAREDS or COMPAREDD are specified for the catalog whose
I      name is indicated by the VVDS entry, the catalog should have:
N
I      -> A non-VSAM record corresponding to the NVR, or a cluster
I         record corresponding with the data or index VVR.
N
I      -> The same storage class, data class, and management class names
I         in the corresponding non-VSAM or cluster record.
N
I      If you are authorized to the RACF FACILITY class name of
I      STGADMIN.IDC.DIAGNOSE.VVDS, you are allowed to open a catalog
I      without performing normal catalog security processing. If you are
I      authorized to this FACILITY class name, normal RACF checking is
I      bypassed. If you try to open a catalog and you are not authorized
I      to this FACILITY class name, message IDC2918I is issued,
I      processing continues, and normal RACF checking takes place.
N
I      COMPAREDD(ddname ...) /* Abbreviation: CMPRDD */: indicates the
I        ddnames of the specific data sets to be checked.
N
I      COMPAREDS(dsname ...) /* Abbreviation: CMPRDS */: indicates the
I       names of the data sets to be checked.
N
D    DUMP | NODUMP -
I      specifies whether entry hexadecimal dumps are to be provided for
I      compare errors.
N
I      DUMP: indicates that entry hexadecimal dumps are to be provided
I        for compare errors. This results in message IDC21365I followed
I        by a display of a record or records.
N
I      NODUMP: indicates that no dump is to be provided.
N
D    ERRORLIMIT(value) /* Abbreviation: ELIMIT */ -
I      specifies a modification of the default error limit. Designed to
I      prevent runaway output, ERRORLIMIT defaults to 16, but any number
I      from 0 to 2147483647 can be specified. During DIAGNOSE, each
I      incorrect entry contributes to the error count used against
I      ERRORLIMIT. When ERRORLIMIT is reached, message IDC31370I is
I      printed and analysis of the source data set is ended.
N
D    EXCLUDE( /* Abbreviation: EXCL */ -
D      ENTRIES(entryname ...) | /* Abbreviation: ENT */ -
D      CATALOG(catalogname ...) | /* Abbreviation: CAT */ -
D      LEVEL(level) /* Abbreviation: LVL */ -
D    ) -
I      specifies that entries is excluded from the scan. INCLUDE and
I      EXCLUDE are mutually exclusive parameters. If omitted, the entire
I      data set is processed. See z/OS DFSMS Managing Catalogs for more
I      information on the effect of specifying INCLUDE and EXCLUDE with
I      the DIAGNOSE commands.
N
I      ENTRIES(entryname ...) /* Abbreviation: ENT */: specifies that
I        the entries listed is excluded from the scan. Up to
I        255 entrynames can be coded.
N
I      CATALOG(catalogname ...) /* Abbreviation: CAT */: specifies that
I        entries that refer to the named catalog are not scanned. Up to
I        99 catalog names can be coded. CATALOG can only be coded for
I        DIAGNOSE VVDS.
N
I      LEVEL(level) /* Abbreviation: LVL */: specifies the high-level
I        qualifiers for entrynames. Only entries with the high-level
I        qualifier specified is excluded from the scan. One level name
I        can be coded.
N
D    INCLUDE( /* Abbreviation: INCL */ -
D      ENTRIES(entryname ...) | /* Abbreviation: ENT */ -
D      CATALOG(catalogname ...) | /* Abbreviation: CAT */ -
D      LEVEL(level) /* Abbreviation: LVL */ -
D    ) -
I      specifies what information is included in the scan. INCLUDE and
I      EXCLUDE are mutually exclusive parameters. If omitted, the entire
I      data set is processed. See z/OS DFSMS Managing Catalogs for more
I      information on the effect of specifying INCLUDE and EXCLUDE with
I      the DIAGNOSE commands.
N
I      ENTRIES(entryname ...) /* Abbreviation: ENT */: specifies that
I        only the entries listed are scanned. Up to 255 entrynames can
I        be coded.
N
I      CATALOG(catalogname ...) /* Abbreviation: CAT */: specifies that
I        only entries that refer to the named catalog are scanned.
I        CATALOG can only be coded for DIAGNOSE VVDS.
N
I      LEVEL(level) /* Abbreviation: LVL */: specifies the high-level
I        qualifiers for entrynames. Only entries with the specified
I        high-level qualifier are scanned. One level name can be coded.
N
D    LIST | -
D    NOLIST /* Abbreviation: NLST */ -
I      specifies whether entries that have no errors are to be listed.
N
I      LIST: indicates the entries that have no errors are to be listed
I        in addition to entries that have errors. This results in
I        message IDC01360I, followed by a list of entrynames.
N
I      NOLIST /* Abbreviation: NLST */: indicates that only entries
I        with errors are listed.
N
D    OUTFILE(ddname) /* Abbreviation: OFILE */
I      specifies a data set, other than the SYSPRINT data set, to
I      receive the output produced by DIAGNOSE (that is, the output
I      resulting from the scan operation).
N
I      ddname: identifies a DD statement that describes the alternate
I        target data set. If OUTFILE is not specified, the output is
I        listed in the SYSPRINT data set. If an alternate data set is
I        specified, it must meet the requirements shown in
I        "JCL DD Statement for an Alternate Target Data Set".
