NChapter 14. IEHMOVE (Move System Data) Program
N----------------------------------------------
MDFSMSdss should be used instead of IEHMOVE to move or copy data to
Mvolumes managed by the Storage Management Subsystem. DFSMSdss or
MIEBCOPY should be used to process PDSEs. You cannot use IEHMOVE with
MPDSEs, ISAM, or VSAM data sets.

MA SECURITY PACKAGE IS A BETTER WAY TO PROTECT ACCESS THAN PASSWORDS.

NExample 3: Move Volume of Data Sets to Disk Volume
N--------------------------------------------------
NIn this example, a volume of data sets is moved to a disk volume. All
Ndata sets that are successfully moved are scratched from the source
Nvolume; however, any catalog entries pertaining to those data sets are
Nnot changed. Space is allocated by IEHMOVE.

NThe control statements are discussed below:
N
N  SYSUT1 DD defines the device that is to contain the work data set.
N
N  DD1 DD defines the system residence device.
N
N  DD2 DD defines the device on which the receiving volume is mounted.
N
N  DD3 DD defines a device on which the source volume is mounted.
N
N  SYSIN DD defines the control data set, which follows in the input
N  stream.
N
N  MOVE specifies a move operation for a volume of data sets and
N  defines the source and receiving volumes. This statement also
N  indicates that password-protected data sets are included in the
N  operation.
