NExample 7: Multiple Copy Operations with Different Output Data Sets
N-------------------------------------------------------------------
NIn this example, members are selected, excluded, and copied from input
Npartitioned data sets to an output partitioned data set. This example
Nis designed to illustrate multiple copy operations.
N
N The example follows:
N
D//COPY     JOB ...
D//ST01#01 EXEC PGM=IEBCOPY
D//SYSPRINT  DD SYSOUT=*
D//OUTA      DD DISP=(OLD),DSN=DATASETA
D//INOUTB    DD DISP=(OLD),DSN=DATASETB
D//INOUTC    DD DISP=(OLD,KEEP),DSN=DATASETC
D//INOUTD    DD DISP=(OLD),DSN=DATASETD
D//INE       DD DISP=(OLD),DSN=DATASETE
D//SYSUT3    DD UNIT=disk,SPACE=(TRK,(1))
D//SYSUT4    DD UNIT=disk,SPACE=(TRK,(1))
D//SYSIN    DD *
D         COPY    OUTDD=OUTA
D         INDD=INE
D         SELECT  MEMBER=(MA,MJ)
D         INDD=INOUTC
D         EXCLUDE MEMBER=(MM,MN)
D         COPY    OUTDD=INOUTB,INDD=INOUTD
D         INDD=((INOUTC,R),INOUTB)
D         COPY    OUTDD=INOUTD,INDD=((INOUTB,R))
D         SELECT  MEMBER=MM

NThe control statements are discussed below:
N
N  OUTA DD defines a partitioned data set, DATASETA, which contains
N  three members (MA, MB and MD).
M
N  INOUTB DD defines a partitioned data set, DATASETB, which contains
N  two members (MA and MJ).
M
N  INOUTC DD defines a partitioned data set, DATASETC, which contains
N  four members (MF, ML, MM and MN).
M
N  INOUTD DD defines a partitioned data set, DATASETD, which contains
N  two members (MM and MP).
M
N  INE DD defines a partitioned data set, DATASETE, which contains
N  three members (MA, MJ and MK).
M
N  SYSUT3 and SYSUT4 DD define temporary spill data sets. One track is
N  allocated for each on a disk volume.
M
N  SYSIN DD defines the control data set, which follows in the input
N  stream. The data set contains three COPY statements, two SELECT
N  statements, one EXCLUDE statement, and several INDD statements.
M
N  The first COPY statement indicates the start of a copy operation.
N  The OUTDD operand specifies DATASETA as the output data set.
M
N  The first INDD statement specifies DATASETE as the first input data
N  set to be processed. The SELECT statement specifies that members MA
N  and MJ are to be copied from DATASETE to DATASETA. Processing occurs
N  as follows:
M
M  1. Member MA is searched for and found, but is not copied because the
M     replace option is not specified.
M
M  2. Member MJ is searched for, found, and copied to DATASETA.
M
N  The second INDD statement marks the end of the first copy step and
N  the beginning of the second copy step within the first copy
N  operation. It specifies DATASETC as the second input data set to be
N  processed. Members MF and ML, which are not named on the EXCLUDE
N  statement, are copied because DATASETA contains neither one of them.
N  EXCLUDE specifies that members MM and MN are not to be copied from
N  DATASETC to DATASETA.
N
N  The second COPY statement indicates the start of another copy
N  operation. The OUTDD parameter specifies DATASETB as the output data
N  set. The INDD parameter specifies DATASETD as the first input data
N  set to be processed. Members MP and MM are copied to DATASETB.
N
N  The next INDD statement specifies DATASETC as the second and
N  DATASETB as the third input data set to be processed. Members MF,
N  ML, MM and MN are copied from DATASETC. Member MM is copied,
N  although DATASETB already contains a member MM, because the replace
N  option is specified.
N
N  The pointer in DATASETB's directory is changed to point to the new
N  (copied) member MM. Thus, the space occupied by the replaced member
N  MM is embedded, unused space. DATASETB is then compressed in place
N  to remove embedded, unused space. (DATASETB is specified as both the
N  input and output data sets.)
N
N  The third COPY statement indicates the start of the last copy
N  operation. The OUTDD parameter specifies DATASETD as the output data
N  set. The INDD parameter specifies DATASETB as the input data set.
N
N  SELECT specifies that member MM is to be copied from DATASETB to
N  DATASETD. Since the replace option is specified on the data set
N  level, member MM is copied and replaces DATASETDs member MM.
* End of WISH.
