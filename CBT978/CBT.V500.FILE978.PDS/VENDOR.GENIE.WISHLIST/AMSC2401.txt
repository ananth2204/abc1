NSyntax for EXPORT DISCONNECT Parameters
N---------------------------------------
D  EXPORT -
N
NRequired Parameters
N-------------------
D    usercatname -
I      names the user catalog to be disconnected. This parameter must
I      be the first parameter following EXPORT. When you are
I      disconnecting a user catalog, you must supply the alter
I      authority to the catalog from which the entry is being removed.
I      Search "Catalog Selection Order for EXPORT DISCONNECT" for the
I      order in which a catalog is selected.
N
I      If the user catalog is SMS-managed, its volume serial number is
I      indicated at the time of disconnect.
N
D    DISCONNECT /* Abbreviation: DCON */ /* - */
I      specifies that a user catalog is to be disconnected. The
I      connector entry for the user catalog is deleted from the master
I      catalog. Also, the user catalog's alias entries are deleted
I      from the master catalog.
N
I      If EXPORT is coded to remove a user catalog connector entry,
I      DISCONNECT is a required parameter. The VVDS volume and the BCS
I      volume can be physically moved to the system to which the
I      catalog is connected.
N
I      To make a user catalog available in other systems and in the
I      original system, code the IMPORT CONNECT command to connect the
I      user catalog to each system to which it is to be available, but
I      do not EXPORT DISCONNECT the user catalog.
N
I      EXPORT DISCONNECT displays the volume serial number of the user
I      catalog at the time of the disconnect. This volume serial number
I      information is required to perform the IMPORT CONNECT.
N
NOptional parameters
N-------------------
M    CATALOG(catname) /* Abbreviation: CAT */
I      specifies, for a disconnect operation, the name of the user
I      catalog from which a user catalog connector entry and any
I      associated alias entries are to be deleted. Search
I      "Catalog Selection Order for EXPORT DISCONNECT" for the order in
I      which a catalog is selected when the CATALOG parameter is not
I      specified. The CATALOG parameter is required when you want to
I      direct the catalog's entry to a particular catalog other than
I      the current master catalog on the system you are running this
I      command on.
N
I      catname/alias: Names the catalog or an alias that can be resolved
I      to a catalog. For example, if alias ABCD relates to catalog
I      SYS1.USERCAT, then specifying either ABCD or SYS1.USERCAT will
I      cause the catalog to be disconnected from catalog SYS1.USERCAT.
