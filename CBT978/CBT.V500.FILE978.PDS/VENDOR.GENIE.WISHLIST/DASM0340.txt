NData management utility programs
N--------------------------------
NNo specific set of characteristics define what constitutes a
Nz/OS utility program today, but common usage includes only a limited
Nnumber of z/OS-provided programs as utilities. The UNIX community, by
Ncontrast, considers many of the standard commands as utilities,
Nincluding compilers, backup programs, filters, and many other types
Nof programs. To the z/OS community these are applications or programs,
Nnot utilities.
N
Nz/OS utilities are usually submitted as batch programs that have
Nsimilar JCL requirements, including four specific data definition (DD)
Nstatements:
N
N-> The SYSPRINT DD statement tells the system where to print the
N   informational or error messages from the utility program.
N
N-> The SYSUT1 DD statement identifies the data set that the utility
N   is to use for input.
N
N-> The SYSUT2 DD statement identifies the data set that the utility
N   is to use for output.
N
N-> The SYSIN DD statement contains utility control statements, which
N   identify a particular function to be performed by a utility program
N   and, when required, to identify specific volumes or data sets to be
N   processed. As an alternative to using the input stream (the
N   SYSIN DD statement), you may place utility control statements in a
N   sequential data set, in a member of a partitioned data set or PDSE,
N   or in a z/OS UNIX System Services (z/OS UNIX) file such as a
N   HFS file.
N
NAlthough utilities are usually run as batch jobs, using ALLOC commands
Nin the TSO foreground is an alternative to using JCL.
