NExample 10: Convert to Hexadecimal and Print Partitioned Data
N-------------------------------------------------------------
NIn this example, two partitioned members are printed according to the
Ndefault format. The printed output is converted to hexadecimal.

NThe control statements are discussed below:
N
N  SYSUT1 DD defines the input data set, called BROWN.MAIN.LIB, on a
N  disk volume.
N
N  SYSUT2 DD defines the output data set on the system output device
N  (printer assumed).
N
N  SYSIN DD defines the control data set, which follows in the input
N  stream.
N
N  PRINT begins the print operation, indicates that the input data set
N  is partitioned, specifies conversion from alphanumeric to
N  hexadecimal representation, and indicates that two MEMBER statements
N  appear in the control data set (MAXNAME=2).
N
N  TITLE specifies a title to be placed beginning in column 10 of the
N  printed output. The title is not converted to hexadecimal.
N
N  MEMBER specifies the member names of the members to be printed
N  (MEMBER1 and MEMBER2).
* End of WISH.
