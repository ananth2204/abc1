NChapter 38. IEBUPDTE -Update Data Set Program
N---------------------------------------------
NIEBUPDTE is an IBM utility that I use for sharing data.
NIt can do wonders at batch edits, but for me, the power is
Nin how I can extract PDS members from one site and load them
Nat another.
N
NI use some self-written REXX code to create an IEBUPDTE stream.
NIt also defines the PDS that will hold the members. After I
NFTP upload the sequential file to the other site I have the
Noption of loading a PDS or doing an EXCLUDE ALL, followed by
Na FIND ./ all and choosing only what I want.
* End of WISH.
