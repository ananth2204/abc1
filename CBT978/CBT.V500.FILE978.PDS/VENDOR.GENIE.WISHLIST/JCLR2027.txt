NJOB Statement
N=============
NPRTY Parameter
N--------------
NUse the PRTY parameter to assign a selection priority to your job.
NWithin a JES2 job class or a JES3 job class group, the system selects
Njobs for execution in order by priority. A job with a higher priority
Nis selected for execution sooner; jobs with the same priority are
Nselected on a first-in first-out basis.
N
NNote: Depending on the JES2 initialization options in use at your
Ninstallation, JES2 may ignore the PRTY parameter.
N
IYou should probably not use this. Tattle on anyone that does!
I
D//jobname  JOB ,PRTY=nn
I                  nn: Requests a priority for the job. The priority
I                      is a number from 0 through 15 for JES2 and
I                      from 0 through 14 for JES3.
I                      The highest priority is 15 or 14.
I
I                      Follow your installation's rules in coding a
I                      priority.
