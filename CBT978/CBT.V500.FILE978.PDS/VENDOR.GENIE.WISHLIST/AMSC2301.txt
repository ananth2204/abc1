NSyntax for EXPORT Parameters
N----------------------------
D  EXPORT /* Abbreviation: EXP */ -
N
NRequired Parameters
N-------------------
D    entryname -
I      Names the cluster, alternate index, or user catalog to be
I      exported. This parameter must be the first parameter following
I      EXPORT. If entryname specifies an SMS-managed data set, the
I      OUTDATASET must either be an SMS-managed data set, or a
I      non-SMS-managed data set cataloged in the catalog determined by
I      the catalog search order (search "Order of Catalog Use").
N
D    OUTFILE(ddname) | /* Abbreviation: OFILE */ -
D    OUTDATASET(outdsn) /* Abbreviation: ODS */ -
I      Specifies the name of the DD statement or the data set that is to
I      receive the data being exported.
N
I      Portable data sets loaded by EXPORT must be sequential data sets.
I      VSAM is not a valid data set organization for portable data sets.
N
I      OUTFILE(ddname) /* Abbreviation: OFILE */: Specifies the name of
I        the DD statement of the target data set.
N
I        Only the block size for the DCB parameter should be specified
I        in the DD statement. The default for block size for EXPORT is
I        2048. Block size can be given in the DD statement to override
I        this default and improve performance.
N
I        Exception: For a nonlabeled tape, the LRECL should be specified
I        if any of the input records are greater in size than the block
I        size. Maximum record size is determined by the value specified
I        with the maximum subparameter of the RECORDSIZE parameter of
I        the DEFINE CLUSTER or DEFINE ALTERNATEINDEX command when the
I        data set was defined.
N
I      OUTDATASET(outdsn) /* Abbreviation: ODS */: Specifies the name of
I        the target data set. If OUTDATASET is specified, an attempt is
I        made to dynamically allocate the target data set. The
I        characteristics of the target data set are described in
I        "JCL DD Statement for a Target Data Set".
N
I        If OUTDATASET specifies an SMS-managed data set, the exported
I        data set must either be an SMS-managed data set, or a
I        non-SMS-managed data set cataloged in the catalog determined
I        by the catalog search order. For information about this search
I        order search "Order of Catalog Use".
N
NOptional Parameters
N-------------------
D    CIMODE | /* Abbreviation: CIM */ -
D    RECORDMODE /* Abbreviation: RECM */ -
I      Specifies whether control interval processing (CIMODE) or logical
I      record processing (RECORDMODE) is to be used to export the
I      records of the data set cluster. RECORDMODE is the default for
I      ESDS, KSDS, and RRDS clusters. CIMODE is the default for LDS
I      clusters.
N
I      CIMODE /* Abbreviation: CIM */: Specifies that the cluster data
I        records written to the portable data set are processed as one
I        VSAM control interval. You can use CIMODE processing to export
I        data sets more quickly. Each control interval is processed as
I        one logical record.
N
I        If control interval processing is used, the target data set's
I        catalog entry will not have correct statistics. These
I        statistics are correctly updated the first time the data set
I        is opened for output.
N
I        When you use control interval processing to export an ESDS
I        cluster that contains an alternate index, logical record
I        processing is used, and a warning message is issued.
N
I        IMPORT will determine the type of processing (control interval
I        or logical record) used by EXPORT to process the cluster data
I        records, and use the same processing type for loading. Thus, a
I        data set that was exported in control intervals is loaded in
I        control intervals. Similarly, a data set exported in logical
I        records is loaded by IMPORT as VSAM logical records.
N
I        The CIMODE portable data set created by the EXPORT command is
I        not compatible with a CIMODE portable data set created on a
I        VSE system. Therefore, any attempt to import an object exported
I        on a VSE system with control interval processing support is not
I        detected by IMPORT and gives unpredictable results.
N
I        During CIMODE processing, data set statistics, such as the
I        number of logical records and the number of inserted records,
I        are not maintained. Data set statistics are not maintained
I        because VSAM cannot update logical record information when
I        whole control intervals are processed. After recalling a data
I        set, a LISTCAT might not show accurate freespace bytes, and a
I        read against the VVR might show zero records although records
I        do exist.
N
I      RECORDMODE /* Abbreviation: RECM */: Specifies that cluster data
I        records written to the portable data set are processed as one
I        VSAM logical record.
N
I        On a system without control interval processing support,
I        RECORDMODE is the default.
N
I        For LDS clusters, the default is CIMODE.
N
D    ERASE | /* Abbreviation: ERAS */ -
D    NOERASE /* Abbreviation: NERAS */ -
I      Specify whether or not the components of the cluster or
I      alternate index to be exported are to be erased (that is,
I      overwritten with binary zeros). This parameter overrides whatever
I      was specified when the object was defined or last altered.
N
I      This parameter can be specified only if the object is to be
I      permanently exported (that is, deleted from the original system).
I      It does not apply to catalogs that must be exported as TEMPORARY.
N
I      ERASE /* Abbreviation: ERAS */:  Specifies that the components
I        are to be overwritten with binary zeros when the cluster or
I        alternate index is deleted. If ERASE is specified, the volume
I        that contains the data component must be mounted.
N
I        If the alternate index is protected by a RACF generic or
I        discrete profile, use RACF commands to specify an ERASE
I        attribute as part of this profile so that the data component
I        is automatically erased upon deletion.
N
I      NOERASE /* Abbreviation: NERAS */:  specifies that the components
I        are not to be overwritten with binary zeros when the cluster
I        or alternate index is deleted.
N
I        NOERASE does not prevent the data component from being erased
I        if it is protected by a RACF generic or discrete profile that
I        specifies the ERASE attribute. You can use RACF commands to
I        alter the ERASE attribute in a profile.
N
D    INFILE(ddname) /* Abbreviation: IFILE */ -
I      Specifies the name of the DD statement that identifies the
I      cluster, alternate index, or catalog to be exported. If the
I      cluster, alternate index, or catalog has been defined with a
I      maximum logical record length greater than 32760 bytes, EXPORT
I      processing ends with an error message, except for EXPORT with
I      control interval processing support.
N
I      In addition to the DD statement for INFILE, one of the following
I      conditions must be true:
N
I      -> The object's entry is in the master catalog.
N
I      -> The qualifiers in the object's name are the catalog's name or
I         alias.
N
I      When INFILE and its DD statement are not specified for a
I      to-be-exported object, an attempt is made to dynamically
I      allocate the object with a disposition of OLD.
N
D    INHIBITSOURCE | /* Abbreviation: INHS */ -
D    NOINHIBITSOURCE /* Abbreviation: NINHS */ -
I      Specifies how the data records in the source data set (ALTERNATE
I      INDEX and CLUSTER) can be accessed after they have been imported
I      to another system. Use the ALTER command to alter this parameter.
N
I      INHIBITSOURCE /* Abbreviation: INHS */: Specifies that the
I        original data records in the original system cannot be accessed
I        for any operation other than retrieval. Use it when the object
I        is to be temporarily exported. (A backup copy of the object is
I        made, and the object itself remains in the original system.)
N
I        If INHIBITSOURCE is specified when exporting a catalog, it is
I        ignored and a warning message issued.
N
I      NOINHIBITSOURCE /* Abbreviation: NINHS */: specifies that the
I        original data records in the original system can be accessed
I        for any kind of operation.
N
D    INHIBITTARGET | /* Abbreviation: INHT */ -
D    NOINHIBITTARGET /* Abbreviation: NINHT */ -
I      Specify whether or not the data records copied into the target
I      alternate index or cluster can be accessed for any operation
I      other than retrieval after they have been imported to another
I      system. This specification can be altered through the ALTER
I      command.
N
I      INHIBITTARGET /* Abbreviation: INHT */:  specifies that the
I        target object cannot be accessed for any operation other than
I        retrieval after it has been imported into another system.
N
I        If INHIBITTARGET is specified when exporting a catalog, it is
I        ignored and a warning message is issued.
N
I      NOINHIBITTARGET /* Abbreviation: NINHT */:  Specifies that the
I        target object can be accessed for any type of operation after
I        it has been imported into another system.
N
D    PURGE | /* Abbreviation: PRG */ -
D    NOPURGE /* Abbreviation: NPRG */ -
I      Specify whether or not the cluster or alternate index to be
I      exported is to be deleted from the original system regardless of
I      the retention period specified in a TO or FOR parameter when the
I      object was defined.
N
I      This parameter can be specified only if the object is to be
I      permanently exported, that is, deleted from the original system.
I      Therefore, it does not apply to catalogs that must be exported
I      as TEMPORARY.
N
I      PURGE /* Abbreviation: PRG */: Specifies that the object is to
I        be deleted even if the retention period has not expired.
N
I      NOPURGE /* Abbreviation: NPRG */: Specifies that the object is
I        not to be deleted unless the retention period has expired.
N
D    TEMPORARY | /* Abbreviation: TEMP */
D    PERMANENT /* Abbreviation: PERM */
I      Specify whether or not the cluster, alternate index, or catalog
I      to be exported is to be deleted from the original system.
N
I      TEMPORARY /* Abbreviation: TEMP */: Specifies that the cluster,
I        alternate index, or catalog is not to be deleted from the
I        original system. The object in the original system is marked
I        as temporary to indicate that another copy exists and that the
I        original copy can be replaced.
N
I        To replace the original copy, a portable copy created by an
I        EXPORT command must be imported to the original system. The
I        IMPORT command deletes the original copy, defines the new
I        object, and copies the data from the portable copy into the
I        newly defined object. Portable data sets being loaded by
I        EXPORT must be sequential data sets. VSAM is not a valid data
I        set organization for portable data sets.
N
I        Catalogs are exported as TEMPORARY.
N
I        Be sure to properly protect the file of the temporary object
I        if you want to deny unauthorized access to that file.
N
I      PERMANENT /* Abbreviation: PERM */: Specifies that the cluster
I        or alternate index is to be deleted from the original system.
I        Its storage space is freed. If its retention period has not yet
I        expired, you must also code PURGE.
N
I      If PERMANENT is specified when exporting a catalog, the catalog
I      will still be exported as TEMPORARY, and a message is issued.
