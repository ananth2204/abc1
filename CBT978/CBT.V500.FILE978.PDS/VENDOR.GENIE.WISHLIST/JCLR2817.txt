NJES3 Control Statement
N======================
NJECL //*NET Statement
N---------------------
NUse the //*NET statement to define the dependencies between
Njobs in a dependent job control (DJC) network. JES3 sets up a network
Nof dependent jobs and executes them in a specific order. (Once set up,
Nthe structure of a DJC network cannot be changed unless all of the jobs
Nin the network are resubmitted.) Jobs belonging to a DJC network cannot
Nbe registered with the automatic restart manager (ARM).
N
D//*NET {NETID | ID} =name{,parameter}...
I    name: Specifies the name of the DJC network for this job. name
I      is 1 through 8 characters; the first character must be
I      alphabetic. All jobs put into the system with the same NETID
I      name form a DJC network. To add a job to an existing DJC
I      network, specify the NETID name for that job.
I
I    ABCMP | AC = {NOKP | KEEP}: Indicates what action JES3 is to take
I      if the job abnormally terminates.
I
I      NOKP: Indicates that JES3 is to purge the DJC network if the job
I        abnormally terminates and has not been resubmitted by the time
I        the other jobs in the network have completed. JES3 purges the
I        network unless successor jobs or subnetworks are missing. If
I        the ABCMP parameter is omitted, NOKP is the default.
I      KEEP: Indicates that the DJC network is to be kept in the system
I        until (1) the job is resubmitted and completes normally or (2)
I        the operator forces the network from the system. Use KEEP to
I        make sure that the network is not purged until the operator
I        takes proper action.
I
I    ABNORMAL | AB = {D | F | R}
I    NORMAL | NC = {D| F | R}:
I    Indicates the action JES3 is to take for this job when any
I      predecessor job completes execution normally or abnormally.
I      If the ABNORMAL parameter is omitted, the default is R,
I      and, if the NORMAL parameter is omitted, the default is D.
I
I      D: Requests that JES3 decrease this job's NHOLD count, which
I        indicates the number of predecessors for this job. When the
I        NHOLD count becomes zero, JES3 can schedule this job.
I      F: Requests that JES3 flush this job and its successor jobs
I        from the system. JES3 cancels the job, prints any output,
I        and cancels all successor jobs presently in the system,
I        regardless of their normal or abnormal specifications.
I        However, JES3 admits into the system all successor jobs
I        that enter after the DJC network has been flushed. To flush
I        those jobs, the operator must cancel the jobs or the network.
I      R: Requests that JES3 retain this job in the system and not
I        decrease the NHOLD count. R suspends the job and its
I        successor jobs from scheduling until either the predecessor
I        job is resubmitted or the operator decreases the NHOLD count.
I
I    DEVPOOL=( {ANY | NET} {,device-name,n}...: Identifies devices to
I      be dedicated to this DJC network. The system allocates these
I      devices only to jobs in the network. The DEVPOOL parameter should
I      be coded on the //*NET statement that establishes the network; it
I      is ignored on other //*NET statements.
I
I      ANY: Indicates that jobs in the network can use any dedicated or
I        undedicated device. JES3 tries to allocate from the dedicated
I        pool before allocating any undedicated devices.
I      NET: Indicates that jobs can use only devices dedicated to the
I        network.
I      device-name,n: Identifies a dedicated device. Code as many
I        device-names with numbers as will fit on one statement.
I        device-name specifies (1) a device name defined to JES3 by
I        the installation during initialization or (2) a device-type
I        defined to the system in HCD. n is the number of named
I        devices.
I
I        n: is a number from 1 through 32,767.
I
I    DEVRELSE= {YES | NO}: Indicates when devices dedicated to the DJC
I      network are to be released. The DEVRELSE parameter can be coded
I      in several jobs in the network, but must not be coded in the
I      first job. If no network job containing DEVRELSE=YES completes,
I      the system releases the devices when it purges the network.
I
I      YES: Requests that JES3 release all devices at the end of this
I        job. Completion of any job that specified DEVRELSE=YES causes
I        the devices dedicated to the network to be released.
I      NO: Requests that JES3 release all devices only when the last
I        job in the network ends.
I
I    NETREL | NR =(netid,jobname): Indicates that this job must be
I      executed before the named job in another DJC network can be
I      executed. The NETREL parameter can be specified only once for
I      each job of a DJC network.
I
I      netid: Identifies the NETID for the successor job.
I      jobname: Names the JOB statement for the successor job.
I
I    NHOLD | HC =n: Indicates the number of predecessor job completions
I      required before this job can be released for scheduling. The
I      predecessor number can include jobs from another DJC network.
I
I      n: is a number from 0 through 32,767.
I
I    NRCMP | PC = {HOLD } NOHO | FLSH}: Indicates that a network job
I      that completed normally is being resubmitted and that JES3 must
I      erase all references to the job before the job reenters the
I      network.
I
I      HOLD: Indicates that JES3 is to hold the job until it is released
I        by the operator.
I      NOHO: Indicates that JES3 is to allow the job to be scheduled as
I        system resources become available.
I      FLSH: Indicates that JES3 is to flush the job from the system.
I
I    OPHOLD | OH = {NO | YES}
I      NO Indicates that the job is to be processed normally without
I        operator intervention. If OPHOLD is omitted, NO is the default.
I      YES: Indicates that JES3 is to hold the job until it is released
I        by the operator.
I
I    RELEASE | RL =(,jobname}: Indicates that this job must be executed
I      before the named job(s) in this DJC network can be executed.
I
I      jobname: Names the JOB statement for a successor job. You can
I        specify from 1 through 50 successor jobnames.
I
I    RELSCHCT | RS =n : Controls early set up of a dependent job's
I      resources. Set up begins when the NHOLD count becomes less than
I      or equal to n.
I
I      n is a number from 1 through 32,767.
