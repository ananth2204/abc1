NDD Statement
N============
NDEST Parameter
N--------------
NUse the DEST parameter to specify a destination for a sysout data
Nset. The DEST parameter can send a sysout data set to a remote or
Nlocal terminal, a node, a node and remote workstation, a local
Ndevice or group of devices, or a node and userid.
N
D//             DEST=destination as defined by your installation
M
N                 destination (JES2):
N                    LOCAL
N                    name
N                    Nnnnnn
N                    NnRmmmmm to NnnnnnRm (node,remote)
N                    Rnnnnn or RMnnnnn or RMTnnnnn
N                    Unnnnn
N                    (node,userid)
M
N                 destination (JES3):
N                    ANYLOCAL
N                    device-name
N                    device-number
N                    group-name
N                    nodename
N                    (node,userid)
M
N->nnnnn = 1 - 32767
N->(node,userid): node (1 - 8 alphanumeric or $, #, @ characters) and
N  TSO/E userid (1 - 7 alphanumeric or $, #, @ characters) or VM userid
N  (1 - 8 alphanumeric or $, #, @ characters)
N
NExample 1:
N------------------
NIn this example, the system sends the sysout data set defined by
NDD statement DEBIT to the work station that submitted the job, the
Ndata set defined by DD statement CALIF to the remote terminal 555,
Nand the data set defined by DD statement FLORIDA to VM userid 9212U28
Nat node BOCA.
N
D//JOBNAME1 JOB ,'MAE BIRD',MSGCLASS=B
D//ST01#01 EXEC PGM=INTEREST
D//DEBIT     DD SYSOUT=A
D//CALIF     DD SYSOUT=A,DEST=R555
D//FLORIDA   DD SYSOUT=A,DEST=(BOCA,'9212U28')

MKenneth Tomiak remark:
MWe can deduce the node (system) BOCA is not an MVS system as the
Muserid starts with a number. The output from DEBIT will appear
Mwith LOCAL if it was submitted on the machine it runs on. And while
MR555 does match the naming convention that ought to be a remote
Msystem, we know nothing about that system. It might even have
Mbeen defined as a LRS/VPS printer. What we do know is that the output
Mwill be transported elsewhere if there is anything setup to
Mreceive it.

MKenneth Tomiak remark:
MYUCK on the JOB level MSGCLASS=B when "B" is often defined as a
MPUNCH card output class.
