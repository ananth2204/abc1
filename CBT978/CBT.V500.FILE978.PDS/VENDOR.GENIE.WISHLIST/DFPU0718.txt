NExample 18: Define and Use a Character in a Graphic Character
NModification Module
N-------------------------------------------------------------
N3800 Model 3
N
NIn this example, a graphic character modification module containing a
Nuser-designed character is built. Next, a format character arrangement
Ntable is modified to include that new character. Then, a copy
Nmodification module is created to print the new character enclosed in a
Nbox of format characters. Finally, the result is tested to allow
Ncomparison of the output with the input.

N
NThe control statements are discussed below:
N
N  The SYSUT1 DD statement includes DISP=OLD to ensure that no other
N  job can modify the data set while this job is executing.
N
N  The GRAPHIC statement's ASSIGN parameter specifies that the 8-bit
N  data code for the user-designed character is X'5C' and the width is
N  10-pitch (the default when no pitch is specified). The GRAPHIC
N  statement is followed by data statements that specify the
N  character's scan pattern for vertical line spacing of 6 lines per
N  inch.
N
N  The name of the graphic character modification module is AIBM, and
N  it is stored as a new module in SYS1.IMAGELIB.
N
N  At STEP2, the INCLUDE statement specifies that a copy of the FM10
N  character arrangement table is to be used as a basis for the new
N  module.
N
N  The TABLE statement identifies the graphic character modification
N  module named AIBM, created in the previous step. The TABLE
N  statement's LOC parameter specifies the translation table entry
N  location (the character's 8-bit data code) of X'5C' and the position
N  (X'2C') where that character is to be loaded into the WCGM.
N
N  The name of the new character arrangement table, which is added to
N  SYS1.IMAGELIB, is BIBM.
N
N  At STEP3, the three COPYMOD statements specify text that is to be
N  placed on lines 58, 59, and 60 of the first copy of the output data
N  set, starting at print position 5 on each line. When used with the
N  BIBM character arrangement table, the characters W, 6, and X print as
N  a top left corner, horizontal line segment, and top right corner, all
N  in line weight 3. The characters 7, *, and 7 print as a weight-3
N  vertical line segment on both sides of the user-designed character
N  built at STEP1 (the asterisk has the EBCDIC assignment 5C, which
N  addresses that character). The hexadecimal E9, F6, and E8 complete
N  the line-weight-3 Format box around the character.
N
N  The name of the copy modification module is CIBM; it is stored as a
N  new module on SYS1.IMAGELIB.
N
N  At TEST, the EXEC statement calls for another execution of the
N  IEBIMAGE program to test the modules just created. On the SYSPRINT DD
N  statement the BIBM character arrangement table is the second of two
N  specified, and the CIBM copy modification module is specified with a
N  table reference character of 1, to use that BIBM table.
N
N  The GRAPHIC statement with no operand specified calls for printing
N  of the module, AIBM, specified with the NAME statement that follows
N  it. Each page of the output listing for this IEBIMAGE run has a small
N  image of the modification printed in the lower left corner.
N
N  The OPTION statement with the DEVICE parameter at STEP1, STEP2, and
N  STEP3 specifies 3800 Model 3 compatibility mode module format and
N  processing considerations.
