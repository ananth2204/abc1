NChapter 4. Installing new TOPICs, CHAPTERs, and WISHes
N------------------------------------------------------
NMember naming standards
N-----------------------
NSearch in $$$$041* members to see if the product you want to
Nadd an example for is already defined. If so, please do put some
Neffort into adding onto it.
N
NHow do you do that?
N-------------------
NAs best as you can with the limited 8 character
Nmember name size limit. I prefer trying to use an acronym for the
Nproduct + what type of manual it is documented in + the CHAPTER in
Nthat manual + two characters to make it unique. Using numbers 00 to
N99 yields 100 examples and that is more than many users will want to
Nlook thru. But if you must exceed the 100 member per CHAPTER per
Nmanual type per product than first experiment with adding NLS and
Nalphabet characters from the start to get the usual sorting sequence
Nthat places those before pure numbers.
N
NAnd then I hit the Appendix and decided it would be rare to hit 90
NChapters in one manual and started using 9a, 9b, 9c, etcetera.
N
NAs I looked at sharing some of samples and examples it became apparent
Nthat my lack of an official manual would allow me to use the range
Nof AA - ZZ in place of numbers.
N
NWhen I updated my base WISHLIST set of files I noticed I had examples
Nfor TRSMAIN. There was a time you had to FTP that from IBM in order
Nto use it. Once IBM came to their senses (user requirement?) they
Nchanged the name to AMATERSE and began shipping it as part of MVS.
NI found it documented In the "Tools and Service Aids" manual.
NThe IBM KnowledgeCenter is new school, whereas I still like a PDF.
NI found iea2v1c2.pdf  GA22-7589-19 and CHAPTER 17 as the source for
Ncompleting member names.
N
NUsing the sample product below:
N-------------------------------
N  iea TSA Tools and Service Aids - Diagnosis
NI took TSA for the product id, went with "D" for diagnosis to now
Nhave TSAD, added 17 for the CHAPTER to yield TSAD17 and added the
Nletter "O" for OLD example, followed by sequencing 01 thru 03. When
Nit was time to populate the examples in the manual I used TSAD17##.
N
NAs I am currently the only one building WISHLIST members for the
Nmagic GENIE edit macro there are no conflicts in my member naming
Nefforts.
N
NWhat are those manual types:
N----------------------------
MA=Application
MC=Commands
MD=Diagnosis
MG=Guide (User's)
MI=Installation
MP=Programming
MR=Reference
MS=Setup and Configuration
MU=Utility
N
N
NPlease avoid the temptation to create new manual types for no good
Nreason. Users will not appreciate your rebellious nature to
NSTANDARDS and CONFORMITY just to express your artistic creativity.
NDo create a new manual type if it can be shown as a de-facto standard
NNOT already covered by one of the above.
N
NRather than use a Summary manual if it has an example, track down
Nthe associated Reference manual.
N
NPair your unique 3 character APPL+manual to best spread your material
Ninto user-consumable chunks. The 8 character length of the DSORG=PO
Nmember names and quantity of IBM products planned to be included with
Nthe GENIE distributed WISHLIST present a challenge for adding
Ncontributions from individuals.
N
M$$$$ is reserved for GENIE as I always wanted the at-one-time
Mhand-edited configuration member, $$$$$$$$, at the top of a member
Mlist. It remains in-use as someone wanting to add their applications
Mwill find instructions under the very first APPL.
