NExample 7: Print a Pre-Formatted Data Set
N-----------------------------------------
NIn this example, the input is a SYSOUT (sequential) data set, which was
Npreviously written as the second data set of a standard label tape. It
Nis printed in SYSOUT format.
N
D//PTSYSOUT JOB ...
D//ST01#01 EXEC PGM=IEBPTPCH
D//SYSPRINT  DD SYSOUT=*
D//SYSUT1    DD DISP=(OLD),DSN=LISTING
D//SYSUT2    DD SYSOUT=*
D//SYSIN     DD *
D         PRINT PREFORM=A
D/*
N
NThe control statements are discussed below:
N
N  SYSUT1 DD defines the input data set, which was previously written
N  as the second data set of a standard label tape. The data set has
N  been assigned the name LISTING.
N
N  SYSUT2 DD defines the output data set on the system output device
N  (printer assumed).
N
N  SYSIN DD defines the control data set, which follows in the input
N  stream.
N
N  The PRINT statement begins the print operation and indicates that an
N  ASA control character is provided as the first character of each
N  record to be printed (PREFORM=A).
