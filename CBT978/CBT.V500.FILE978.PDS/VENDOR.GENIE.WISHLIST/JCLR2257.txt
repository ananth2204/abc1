NOUTPUT JCL Statement
N====================
NOUTDISP Parameter
N-----------------
NIn a JES2 system, use the OUTDISP parameter to indicate the disposition
N of a sysout data set. You can code different dispositions based on
Nwhether the job completes successfully.
N
D//outds OUTPUT OUTDISP=Ýnormal-disposition,abnormal-disposition¨
I                 WRITE: Indicates that the system is to print the
I                   sysout data set. After printing the data set,
I                   the system purges it.
I
I                   Unless it is held by the system or operator, a
I                   sysout data set with the disposition WRITE will
I                   always print.
I
I                 HOLD: Indicates that the system is to hold the sysout
I                   data set until the user or operator releases it.
I                   Releasing the sysout data set changes its
I                   disposition to WRITE.
I
I                   If HOLD output is not released, the system holds it
I                   until the user or operator purges it.
I
I                   NJE Note: In an NJE environment, the system does
I                   not hold the data set until it reaches its ultimate
I                   destination node.
I
I                 KEEP: Indicates that the system is to print the sysout
I                   data set. After printing the data set, the system
I                   changes its disposition to LEAVE.
I
I                 LEAVE: Indicates that after the user or operator
I                   releases the sysout data set, the disposition of the
I                   data set changes to KEEP.
I
I                 If LEAVE output is not released, the system holds it
I                   until the user or operator purges it.
I
I                 PURGE: Indicates that the system is to delete the
I                   sysout data set without printing it.
