NChapter 19: Dump suppression
N----------------------------
NUsing DAE to suppress dumps
N---------------------------
NStopping, starting, and changing DAE
N------------------------------------
NIf an ADYSET00 parmlib member is used and the DAE data set is
Nallocated, DAE starts during IPL. Normally, DAE runs at the same
Ntime as the system. However if DUMPSRV is ever cancelled
Nor restarted, DAE restarts as well albeit with dump suppression
Ninactive You must manually reactivate dump suppression using
Nthe SET DAE=xx command.
N
NAn operator can stop and start DAE with the following steps. One reason
Nto use these steps would be to change to a different ADYSETxx parmlib
Nmember with different parameters.
N
NStopping DAE
N------------
NYou can stop DAE with a SET DAE command that specifies the ADYSET01
Nparmlib member, which contains a DAE=STOP statement:
N
DSET DAE=01
N
N
NStarting DAE
N------------
NYou can start DAE with a SET DAE command that specifies an ADYSETxx
Nparmlib member that contains the DAE=START parameter, such as an
Ninstallation-provided ADYSET03 parmlib member:
N
DSET DAE=03
