NChapter 16: SPZAP
N-----------------
NPlanning for SPZAP
N------------------
NSPZAP is an application that provides editing capabilities for data on
Na direct access storage device (DASD). Protect against SPZAP (and other
Napplications that can update data sets) being used to damage data
Nthrough use of the installation's security protection scheme:
N
N-> In z/OS DFSMS Using Data Sets, see the chapter, "Protecting Data
N   Sets" for information pertaining to protecting data sets.
N
N-> In z/OS DFSMSdfp Advanced Services, see the chapter, "Protecting the
N   VTOC and VTOC Index" for information pertaining to protecting VTOCs.
N
NInstallations using RACF should employ a combination of GDASDVOL and
NDASDVOL resource profiles to establish this protection. See z/OS
NSecurity Server RACF Security Administrator's Guide for more
Ninformation regarding these profiles.
N
NIBM recognizes the particular sensitivity of the VTOC. For a VTOC, the
Nconsole operator must respond to message AMA117D before SPZAP will
Nprocess an update request. This authorization must be supplied in
Naddition to authorization through use of the installation's security
Nprotection scheme.
