NChapter 4: Stand-Alone dump
N---------------------------
NPlanning for stand-alone dump
N-----------------------------
N
NShould I take a stand-alone dump to DASD or to tape?
N----------------------------------------------------
NWhen choosing an output device for stand-alone dump, consider the need
Nfor operator intervention, the amount of operator intervention
Ninvolved, and the amount of time the system will be unavailable.
N
N-> Do you use a virtual tape subsystem (VTS) or require operators to
N   physically mount tape cartridges?
N
N-> Do you have pre-allocated DASD data sets?
N
N  -> If I do dump to DASD, how much space do I need?
I     The maximum size of a single-volume DASD dump data set depends on
I     the type of data set.
I     -> Conventional sequential data sets can span 65,535 tracks, and
I        can hold approximately 3 GB.
I     -> Large format (DSNTYPE=LARGE) data sets can span 16,777,215
I        tracks. The maximum size for large format data sets is 768 GB.
I     -> You can define a multi-volume DASD dump data set that can span
I        up to 32 volumes of the same device type.
N
N-> Can you dump to multiple dump data sets?
I   Stand-alone dump does allow you to dump to multiple dump data sets.
I   By coding the DDSPROMPT=YES keyword on the AMDSADMP macro, you can
I   generate a stand-alone dump program that allows run-time dump data
I   set prompting.
N
N-> What can you name my DASD dump data sets?
I   The data set name must contain the text 'SADMP' as either part of,
I   or as an entire data set qualifier.
N
N-> How much of the system should I dump?
I   It depends. The situation dictates the amount of information you
I   need to diagnose the failure. You can use the DUMP keyword to
I   control the amount of storage you want dumped.
N
N-> When should you specify the dump tailoring options?
I   The most flexible way to specify the dump options for a stand-alone
I   dump is to specify, on the DUMP keyword of the AMDSADMP macro,
I   those areas of storage you normally always want dumped and
I   additionally allow the operator who requests the dump to specify
I   additional options by coding the PROMPT keyword on the AMDSADMP
I   macro.
N
N-> Should you use IEBGENER or the COPYDUMP subcommand to copy a dump
N   to a data set?
I   The recommended method is IPCS COPYDUMP. IPCS COPYDUMP can run
I   without a dump directory being employed. Use the DEFER option
I   when initiating the IPCS session to tell IPCS to defer accessing a
I   dump directory until one is required.
N
N-> Can I use my current version of the stand-alone dump program to
N   dump a new version of z/OS?
I   Always use the stand-alone dump version that is generated from
I   the same release of z/OS that you want to dump.
