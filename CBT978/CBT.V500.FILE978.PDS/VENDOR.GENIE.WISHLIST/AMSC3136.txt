NCase 6: Creating a Duplex Pair from Two Simplex Volumes
N-------------------------------------------------------
NThe procedure to create a duplex pair is:
N
N  1. Identify the primary and secondary volumes
N
N  2. Issue SETCACHE SUBSYSTEM ON
N
N  3. Vary the target secondary volume offline to all systems
N
N  4. SETCACHE NVS ON
N
N  5. SETCACHE SETSECONDARY specifying the primary volume id and
N     secondary address
N
N  6. SETCACHE DEVICE ON for the primary volume
N
N  7. (optional) SETCACHE DASDFASTWRITE ON
N
NNotes:
N  1. If DASD fast write or device caching was on for the primary
N     volume before SETCACHE SETSECONDARY was issued, DASD fast write
N     or device caching is on for the pair after it is established.
N
N  2. Device caching may be activated to speed up establishing the
N     duplex pair.
N
N  3. When you use dual copy to migrate from 3390 devices to RAMAC
N     devices, an invalid format 4 DSCB is created on the target
N     device. An ICKDSF APAR must be installed to fix the format 4 DSCB.
N     See your IBM representative for the latest service level.
N
N  4. If either volume was previously acquired by an LPAR and has not
N     been released, an error message is issued with text that states
N     that the duplex pair could not be established because path-groups
N     are not compatible.
