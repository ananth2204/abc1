N=========================
NChapter 2. REXX general concepts
N--------------------------------
N  Commands to external environments
N  ---------------------------------
N    Host commands and host command environments
N    -------------------------------------------
NYou can issue host commands from a REXX program. When the language
Nprocessor processes a clause that it does not recognize as a REXX
Ninstruction or an assignment instruction, the language processor
Nconsiders the clause to be a host command and routes the command to
Nthe current host command environment. The host command environment
Nprocesses the command and then returns control to the language
Nprocessor.
N
NFor example, in REXX processing, a host command can be:
N
N-> A TSO/E command processor, such as ALLOCATE, FREE, or EXEC
N
N-> A TSO/E REXX command, such as NEWSTACK or QBUF
N
N-> A program that you link to or attach
N
N-> An MVS system or subsystem command that you invoke during an
N   extended MCS console session
N
N-> An ISPF command or service
N
N-> An SAA CPI Communications call or APPC/MVS call
N
MDebugging tip: To check on the current enviroonment use:
D  current_environment = Address()
D  Say "The current environment is:" current_environment"."
I
ISee the manual if you have issues trying to run an authorized command
Idefined in the PARMLIB(IKJTSOxx) member, but executed from a non-APF
Idata set. In a CLIST it runs unauthorized, in REXX it fails with a
IRC = -3.
N
N
NIf a system abend occurs during a host command, the REXX special
Nvariable RC is set to the negative of the decimal value of the abend
Ncode. If a user abend occurs during a host command, the REXX special
Nvariable RC is set to the decimal value of the abend code. If no
Nabend occurs during a host command, the REXX special variable RC is
Nset to the decimal value of the return code from the command.
N
NCertain conditions may be raised depending on the value of the special
Nvariable RC:
N
N-> If the RC value is negative, the FAILURE condition is raised.
N
N-> If the RC value is positive, the ERROR condition is raised.
N
N-> If the RC value is zero, neither the ERROR nor FAILURE conditions
N   are raised.
