NChapter 31. Using SETCACHE
N--------------------------
NCase 18: Migrating Duplex Volumes
N---------------------------------
NThis procedure is valid for migrating a primary or secondary volume in
Na duplex pair to another like device.
N
N-> Vary the target volume offline to all systems.
N
N-> Issue SETCACHE SUSPENDSECONDARY or SUSPENDPRIMARY, depending on
N   whether the secondary or the primary, respectively, needs to be
N   taken out of the duplex pair.
N
N-> Issue SETCACHE REESTABLISHDUPLEX with the third volume.
N
N-> After the copy completes, perform the required action for the
N   volume suspended from the duplex pair.
N
NNote: When you use dual copy to migrate from 3390 devices to RAMAC
Ndevices, an invalid format 4 DSCB is created on the target device. Use
NICKDSF to fix the format 4 DSCB. See your IBM representative for the
Nlatest service level of ICKDSF that provides this function.
N
N1. When the SETCACHE SUSPENDPRIMARY completes, the system device number
N   points to the CCA address of the old primary volume. Internally, the
N   Storage Control has swapped the CCA-to-DDC pointers. The old primary
N   CCA now points to the old secondary physical device DDC. Thus, the
N   old secondary volume has become the new primary volume; all system
N   I/O is directed to the new primary. The CCA for the old secondary
N   volume now points to the DDC address of the old primary device.
N
N2. After the REESTABLISHDUPLEX completes, the new secondary is
N   incorporated into the duplex pair, the old primary volume is no
N   longer in the pair, and the CCA of the old secondary now points to
N   the DDC address of the old primary. To run ICKDSF or any other
N   program against the old primary volume, the old primary should be
N   addressed as 212.
