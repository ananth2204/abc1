NChapter 5: ABEND dump
N---------------------
NContents of ABEND dumps
N-----------------------
NYou can specify the contents of an ABEND dump by specifying parameters
Non the ddname in the JCL for the program. This topic discusses the
NIBM-supplied default contents and contents available through
Ncustomization.
M
MThat is a badly written statement since a DDNAME never has parameters.
MWhat the author meant to write is that the DDNAME affects what gets
Mdumped.
N
NAll three ABEND dumps contain a summary dump, although the SYSMDUMP
Nsummary dump contains less information than the SYSABEND and SYSUDUMP
Nsummary dumps. The SYSUDUMP consists of only the summary dump. The
NSYSABEND dump also contains task data, while the SYSMDUMP also contains
Nsystem data. The SYSMDUMP dump is a synchronous SVC dump and contains
Ndata similar to the data in an SVC dump.
N
N
NDetermining current ABEND dump options
N--------------------------------------
NUse a DISPLAY DUMP operator command to get the dump mode and options in
Neffect for SVC dumps and ABEND SYSABEND, SYSMDUMP, and SYSUDUMP
Ndumps. The system displays the mode and options in message IEE857I.
N
NExample: Determining the mode and options
N-----------------------------------------
NTo request the mode and options, enter:
N
I  DISPLAY DUMP,OPTIONS
N
NIf the options listed are not the ones desired, use a CHNGDUMP operator
Ncommand to change them.
N
MThe manual contains another copy of the table that shows what each
Moption dumps. You might want to look at WISH TSAD0204.
