NChapter 4: Stand-Alone dump
N---------------------------
NRunning the stand-alone dump program
N------------------------------------
NThe operator usually takes a stand-alone dump for one of the following
Ntypes of problems:
N
N-> Disabled wait
N-> Enabled wait
N-> Loop
N-> Partial system hang
N
NWhen one of these problems occurs, the stand-alone dump program,
Nresiding in the SYS1.PAGEDUMP.Vvolser data set,
Ncan be run to produce a stand-alone dump.
N
NThere are several procedures that can be used to run the stand-alone
Ndump program:
N
N-> "Procedure A: Initialize and run stand-alone dump"
N-> "Procedure B: Restart stand-alone dump"
N-> "Procedure C: ReIPL stand-alone dump"
N-> "Procedure D: Dump the stand-alone dump program"
N
NProcedure A: Initialize and run stand-alone dump
N------------------------------------------------
NUse the following procedure to initialize and run a stand-alone dump.
N1. Ready the residence device. If it is a tape, mount the volume on a
N   device attached to the selected processor and ensure that the
N   file-protect ring is in place. If it is a DASD volume, ensure that
N   it is write-enabled.
N
N2. If dumping a failed stand-alone dump program, in order to diagnose
N   the stand-alone dump failure, select the Store Status option during
N   the IPL, or perform a manual Store Status. Otherwise, for all other
N   cases, do not perform a Store Status because the machine
N   automatically performs a Store Status when it is necessary.
N
MMessage from Kenneth Tomiak:
MI placed item #4 ahead of #3 because you need to set the LOADPARM
Mbefore you IPL, not after.
N
N4. When stand-alone dump is IPLed, you can specify a load parm that
N   alters the operation of stand-alone dump.
N
NThe format of the load parm is Saddddo.
N
N  S The constant S must be specified as the first character or the
N    load parm will be ignored.
N
N  a The a specification allows stand-alone dump to start using a
N    console without the operator performing any action on it. It also
N    allows stand-alone dump to bypass the prompts for which output
N    device and default dump title to use. You can specify the
N    following values for a:
N
N      No console communication requested. Use default dump device and
N         title. Execution begins with no console messages. No
N         prompting to the operator is allowed. If a prompt occurs, a
N         wait state will be loaded.
N
N      O  Use the default console with the default dump device
N         and title.
N         No prompting to the operator is allowed. If a prompt occurs, a
N         wait state will be loaded.
N
N      M  Use the default console with the default dump device and
N         title. Additional prompts can be made to the operator if they
N         are needed.
N
N      C  Use the default console. The operator must respond to all
N         prompts.
N
N      P  Wait for an interrupt from the console device that is to be
N         used. If you do not supply the load parm, this is the default.
N
N  dddd The dddd specification is the default console device. It must be
N       one of the devices specified as a console device on the AMDSADMP
N       macro when the stand-alone dump was generated, or the constant
N       SYSC for the hardware system console. If you do not specify a
N       default console device, then the stand-alone dump will use the
N       first console defined on the AMDSADMP macro when the
N       stand-alone dump was generated.
N
N       The AMDSADMP macro allows you to specify SYSC as the first
N       console in the console list. If you do this without specifying
N       a console device in the load parm, the hardware system console
N       will be the default console device.
N
N o The o field contains flags, and the second bit (bit 1) indicates
N   that SADMP must start an IPL of MVS at the conclusion of its
N   processing. If bit 1 is on, and SADMP locates an AutoIPL policy
N   within MVS storage that specifies a re-IPL of MVS, SADMP uses the
N   information to initiate an IPL of MVS.
N
N   For details about AutoIPL, see topic about Using the automatic IPL
N   function in z/OS MVS Planning: Operations.
N
N   The valid values for the o field are '0', '4' or blank.
N   '0' or  blank leaves all bits off.
N
N   '4' sets bit 1 on. Bit 1 is intended to automate the re-IPL of MVS
N   when SADMP is initiated manually. IBM recommends that it be left
N   off otherwise.
N
NIf you do not use the load parm, select the system console or an
Noperator console with a device address that is in the console list
Nthat you specified at stand-alone dump generation time (in the CONSOLE
Nkeyword of AMDSADMP). At stand-alone dump run time, the operator can
Nchoose either a console specified with the CONSOLE= keyword or the
Nsystem console to control stand-alone dump operation. If an operator
Nconsole is chosen, press ATTENTION or ENTER on that console. (On some
Nconsoles, you might have to press RESET first.) This causes an
Ninterruption that informs stand-alone dump of the console's address.
N
NMessage AMD001A appears on the console.
N
N5. Ready an output device.
N
N6. Reply with the device number for the output device.
N
N7. Stand-alone dump prompts you, with message AMD011A, for a dump
N   title.
N
N3. IPL stand-alone dump.
NStand-alone dump does not communicate with the operator console.
NInstead, stand-alone dump loads an enabled wait PSW with wait
Nreason code X'3E0000'.
N
NStand-alone dump waits for a console I/O interrupt or an external
Ninterrupt.
N
NIf an operator console is chosen, press ATTENTION or ENTER on that
Nconsole. (On some consoles, you might have to press RESET first.)
NThis causes an interruption that informs stand-alone dump of the
Nconsole's address.
N
NWhen no console is available, run stand-alone dump without a console.
NEnter an external interruption on the processor that stand-alone dump
Nwas IPLed from. Stand-alone dump proceeds using the default output
Ndevice and/or the default dump data set. No messages appear on any
Nconsoles; stand-alone dump uses PSW wait reason codes to communicate
Nto the operator.
N
NWhen stand-alone dump completes processing, stand-alone dump unloads
Nthe tape, if there is one, and enters a wait reason code X'410000'.
N
NExample: Using a load parm to perform a stand-alone dump
N--------------------------------------------------------
NIn this example, the dump is initialized using a load parm with no
Nconsole prompts.

NProcedure B: Restart stand-alone dump
N-------------------------------------
NWhen you want to restart stand-alone dump, try procedure B before you
Ntry procedure C or D.
N
NA system restart does not always work, either because it occurs at a
Npoint when stand-alone dump internal resources are not serialized, or
Nbecause stand-alone dump has been too heavily damaged to function. If
Nthe restart does not work, try procedure C (reIPL).
N
NIf a dump to a DASD data set is truncated because there is not enough
Nspace on the data set to hold the dump, use a system restart to dump
Nthe original data to tape. By causing a system restart, you can
Nreinitialize and restart a failing stand-alone dump program without
Nlosing the original data you wanted to dump.
N
N1. Perform a system restart on the processor that you IPLed
N   stand-alone dump from.
N
N2. It either starts or it does not start.
N
N3. Resume using Procedure A.
NProcedure C: ReIPL stand-alone dump
N-----------------------------------
ITo run procedure C, repeat procedure A.
N
NWhen you reIPL stand-alone dump, the previous running of stand-alone
Ndump has already overlaid some parts of central storage and modified
Nthe page frame table.
N
NIf the virtual storage dump program was in control, a reIPL might not
Ndump paged-out virtual storage. The number of times that you can IPL
Nstand-alone dump to dump paged-out virtual storage is equal to the
Nnumber of processors present.
N
NIf the previous IPL of stand-alone dump did not load a wait state and
Nreason code of X'250000' or higher and the reIPL succeeds,
Nstand-alone dump usually completes processing as in procedure A. Some
Nstorage locations might not reflect the original contents of central
NStorage because, during a previous IPL, stand-alone dump overlaid the
Ncontents. These locations include the absolute PSA and possibly other
NPSAs.
N
N
NProcedure D: Dump the stand-alone dump program
N----------------------------------------------
NUse a new IPL of stand-alone dump to debug stand-alone dump if
Nstand-alone dump fails.
N
MBUT WAIT, IF STAND-ALONE DUMP FAILED BEFORE, WHY SHOULD IT WORK NOW?
M
MAt this point you are in a sticky situation. Are you prepared to
Mwipe out the system dump you needed to get just to diagnose the
Mstand-alone dump program? I hope not.
M
MSo, what to do? You needed to plan ahead and have alternate dump to
Mdevices at the ready, tape or DASD.
N
NFollow procedure A at step 2 by performing a STORE STATUS instruction.
NStand-alone dump follows procedure A steps 2 through 6, then issues
Nmessage AMD088D. This message allows the operator to stop the dump
Nafter central storage has been dumped or to continue dumping virtual
Nstorage.
N
NStand-alone self-dump
N---------------------
NWhen running a virtual storage dump and stand-alone dump error
Nrecovery detects errors in stand-alone dump, stand-alone dump can
Ntake a self-dump before proceeding. At most, stand-alone dump takes
Ntwelve self-dumps; after the twelfth request for a self-dump,
Nstand-alone dump stops taking self-dumps, but continues to count the
Nnumber of self-dump requests and continues to issue the AMD066I
Nmessage. After a large number of self-dump requests, stand-alone dump
Nterminates. Stand-alone dump places both the self-dump and the
Noperating system dump onto the output tape or DASD.
N
NYou can use the LIST subcommand of IPCS to print stand-alone dump
Nself-dumps. The format of the subcommand is as follows,
Nwhere nnn = 001 - 012:
N
I  LIST address COMPDATA(AMDSAnnn)
N
N
NRunning the stand-alone dump program in a sysplex
N-------------------------------------------------
NMethod A
N--------
NUse this method to take a stand-alone dump of an MVS system that
Nresides in a sysplex. Assume that the MVS system to be dumped is
N"SYSA".
N
N1. IPL the stand-alone dump program on SYSA (see "Running the
N   stand-alone dump Program").
N
N2. Issue VARY XCF,SYSA,OFFLINE from another active MVS system in the
N   sysplex if message IXC402D or IXC102A is not already present.
N
N   You do not have to wait for the stand-alone dump to complete before
N   issuing the VARY XCF,SYSA,OFFLINE command.
N
N3. Reply DOWN to message IXC402D or IXC102A.
N
INote: DO NOT perform a SYSTEM RESET in response to IXC402D, IXC102A
I      after the IPL of stand-alone dump.
N
NMethod B
N--------
NIf there is a time delay between performing the STOP function and
NIPLing the stand-alone dump program use this method. Using this
Nmethod expedites the release of resources held by system SYSA while
Nyou are preparing to IPL stand-alone dump.
N
N1. Perform the SYSTEM RESET-NORMAL function on SYSA.
N
N2. Issue VARY XCF,SYSA,OFFLINE from another active MVS system in the
N   sysplex if message IXC402D or IXC102A is not already present.
N
N3. Reply DOWN to message IXC402D, IXC102A
N
N   Performing steps 2 and 3 immediately after doing the SYSTEM RESET
N   will expedite sysplex recovery actions for SYSA and allow resources
N   held by SYSA to be cleaned up quickly, thus enabling other systems
N   in the sysplex to continue processing.
N
N4. IPL the stand-alone dump program.
N
NAfter a SYSTEM RESET is performed, MVS cannot automatically ISOLATE
Nsystem SYSA through SFM, so message IXC402D or IXC102A will be issued
Nafter the VARY XCF,SYSA,OFFLINE command or after the XCF failure
Ndetection interval expires. You must reply DOWN to IXC402D or IXC102A
Nbefore sysplex partitioning can complete.
N
N
NCapturing a stand-alone dump quickly
N------------------------------------
N-> Minimize the operator actions
N-> Get a partial stand-alone dump
N   Use the EXTERNAL INTERRUPT key to terminate the dumping process.
N   This causes a clean stop, closing the output dataset properly.
N
