N--------------------------
NSyntax for DEFINE NONVSAM Parameters
N------------------------------------
D  DEFINE /* Abbreviation: DEF */ -
N
NRequired Parameters
N-------------------
D    NONVSAM( /* Abbreviation: NVSAM */ -
I      specifies that a non-VSAM non-SMS-managed data set is to be
I      defined or that a collection of objects is to be defined. The
I      collection of objects you define are SMS-managed. To define a
I      non-VSAM SMS-managed data set that is not a collection of
I      objects, use either the ALLOCATE command or JCL.
N
D      NAME(entryname) -
I        specifies the name of the non-VSAM data set or collection of
I        objects being defined. The entryname is the name that appears
I        in the catalog; it is the name used in all future references to
I        the data set. The entryname must be unique within the catalog
I        in which it is defined.
N
I        You identify a GDS with its GDG name followed by the data set's
I        generation and version numbers (GDGname.GxxxxVyy). The update
I        or higher RACF authority to the GDG is required. The GDG must
I        exist before the GDS is defined.
N
I        Exception: For OAM, the entryname is the name of the OAM
I        collection. To define an OAM collection, you must specify both
I        the COLLECTION and RECATALOG parameters.
N
D      DEVICETYPES(devtype devtype...) /* Abbreviation: DEVT */ -
I        specifies the device types of the volumes containing the
I        non-VSAM data set being defined. If the non-VSAM data set
I        resides on different device types, the device types must be
I        specified in the same order as the volume serial numbers listed
I        in the VOLUMES parameter.
N
I        You can specify a generic device name that is supported by your
I        system, for example, 3390. Search "Device Type Translate Table"
I        for a list of generic device types.
N
I        Restriction: Do not specify an esoteric device group such as
I        SYSDA, because allocation can be unsuccessful if:
N
I        -> Input/output configuration is changed by adding or deleting
I           one or more esoteric device groups.
N
I        -> The esoteric definitions on the creating and using systems
I           do not match when the catalog is shared between the two
I           systems.
N
I        -> The data set was cataloged on a system not defined with the
I           Hardware Configuration Definition (HCD), but used on a
I           system that is defined with HCD.
N
I        If you expect to change the device type of the system residence
I        volume, you can code DEVICETYPES(0000) and this field is
I        resolved at LOCATE, and DELETE time to the device type. This
I        will allow you to use the non-VSAM data sets without having to
I        recatalog them to point to the new volume. When you code
I        DEVICETYPES(0000) you must also code VOLUMES(******), or an
I        error will result.
N
I        You can code DEVICETYPES(0000) if the VOLUMES parameter
I        specifies an indirect volume serial ('******'), or an extended
I        indirect volume serial (a system symbol). A value of
I        DEVICETYPES(0000) will cause the actual device type to be
I        determined from the current system residence volume (or its
I        logical extension) at the time the catalog entry is retrieved.
I        DEVICETYPES(0000) is only valid with an indirect volume serial
I        specification in the VOLUMES parameter.
N
I        In addition to the above, if you are using the symbolic form
I        of volume serials, the volume must be mounted and online at
I        the time the catalog entry is retrieved from the catalog. If
I        it is not, the catalog request will be terminated with a return
I        and reason code.
N
I        Exception: DEVICETYPES is not applicable for an OAM non-VSAM
I        entry and is ignored if specified.
N
D      VOLUMES(volser volser...) /* Abbreviation: VOL */ -
I        specifies the volumes to contain the non-VSAM data set. VOLUMES
I        is required when you define a non-OAM non-VSAM data set.
N
I        There are two special forms of the VOLUMES parameter that can
I        be provided, and they are referred to as the indirect volume
I        serial forms. They result in the system dynamically resolving
I        the volume serial to the system residence (or its logical
I        extension) serial number when the catalog entry is retrieved.
I        It is not resolved when the DEFINE NONVSAM is processed. This
I        allows you to later change the volume serial number(s) of the
I        system residence volume (or its logical extensions) without
I        having to recatalog the non-VSAM data sets on those volumes.
N
I        The two special forms are:
N
I        1. VOLUMES(******)
N
I        2. VOLUMES(&xxxxx), where &xxxxx is a symbol contained in the
I           SYS1.PARMLIB IEASYMXX member that was specified at IPL time.
I           The symbol name is intended to represent the volume that is
I           a logical extension of the system residence volume. The
I           symbol name must be specified as a single, simple (not
I           substringed) symbol of no more than six characters including
I           the leading ampersand. If a symbol is intended to represent
I           a six-character volume serial number, the symbol must be
I           six characters long and the ending period must be omitted.
I           As an example:
N
I           VOLUMES(&SYSR2)
N
I           If &SYSR2 has been defined at IPL by an entry in the
I           IEASYMxx member, the value of that symbol will be used when
I           this catalog entry is retrieved from the catalog. If the
I           symbol is not defined, the value returned for the volume
I           serial will be &SYSR2.
N
I           IBM recommends the use of the symbol &SYSR2 for the first
I           logical extension to the system reference volume, &SYSR3 for
I           the second, and so on.
N
I        Exception: VOLUMES is not applicable for an OAM non-VSAM entry
I        and is ignored if specified.
N
I        If you code VOLUMES(******), then the system dynamically
I        resolves this to the system residence volume serial number
I        whenever the catalog entry is used. It is not resolved when
I        the DEFINE NONVSAM is processed. This allows you to later
I        change the volume serial number of system residence volume
I        without also having to recatalog the non-VSAM data sets on
I        that volume.
N
I        Use RACF commands to specify an ERASE attribute in a generic
I        or discrete profile for a non-VSAM data set. Use of this
I        attribute renders all allocated DASD tracks unreadable before
I        space on the volume is made available for reallocation. Refer
I        to the appropriate RACF publications for information about how
I        to specify and use this facility.
N
NOptional Parameters
N-------------------
D      COLLECTION /* Abbreviation: COLLN */ -
I        specifies that the entry being defined is an Object Access
I        Method (OAM) entry. This parameter is required when you define
I        an OAM entry. If you use COLLECTION, you must also specify the
I        RECATALOG parameter.
N
D      FILESEQUENCENUMBERS(number ...) /* Abbreviation: FSEQN */ -
I        specifies the file sequence number of the non-VSAM data set
I        being defined. FILESEQUENCENUMBERS is not applicable for an
I        OAM non-VSAM entry and is ignored if specified.
N
I        This number indicates the position of the file being defined
I        with respect to other files on the tape. If the data set spans
I        volumes or if more than one volume is specified, you must
I        specify a file sequence number for each volume. Either 0 or 1
I        indicates the first data set on the tape volume. The default
I        is 0.
N
D      OWNER(ownerid) -
I        Identifies the generation data set's owner.
N
I        For TSO users, if the owner is not identified with the OWNER
I        parameter, the TSO userid is the default ownerid.
N
I        Exception: If OWNER is not specified, the TSO userid is the
I        default ownerid.
N
D      RECATALOG|NORECATALOG /* Abbreviations: RCTLG and NRCTLG */ -
I        specifies whether the catalog entries for the non-VSAM data
I        set are to be re-created or are to be created for the first
I        time. If RACF is installed, RACF access authority, defined
I        under SMS, is required.
N
I        RECATALOG /* Abbreviation: RCTLG */: specifies that the catalog
I          entries are re-created if valid VVDS entries are found on the
I          primary VVDS volume. If valid VVDS entries are not found on
I          the primary VVDS volume, the command ends. RECATALOG can be
I          specified only for an SMS-managed data set.
N
I          Catalog entries can be re-created only in the catalog
I          specified in the NVR except for entries that are swap space,
I          page space, or SYS1 data sets. In a multihost environment,
I          non-SYS1 IPL data sets that are SMS-managed cannot be
I          recataloged to a different catalog from the one specified in
I          the NVR. SMS-managed IPL data sets must be SYS1 data sets to
I          be shared in a multihost environment.
N
I          The VOLUMES and DEVICETYPES parameters are required,
I          specified as they were when the data set was originally
I          defined. If the CATALOG, OWNER, or FILESEQUENCENUMBERS
I          parameters were specified for the original define, they
I          should be respecified with RECATALOG.
N
I          Exception: RECATALOG must be specified when you use the
I          COLLECTION parameter. DEFINE RECATALOG COLLECTION is intended
I          to be used to rebuild catalog entries.
N
I        NORECATALOG /* Abbreviation: NRCTLG */: creates the catalog
I          entries for the first time.
N
D      TO(date) | FOR(days) -
I        specifies the retention period for the non-VSAM data set being
I        defined. If neither a TO nor FOR is specified, the non-VSAM
I        data set can be deleted at any time.
N
I        For non-SMS-managed non-VSAM data sets, the correct retention
I        period is selected in the catalog entry. The VTOC entry might
I        not contain the correct retention period. Issue a LISTCAT
I        command to see the correct expiration date.
N
I        For SMS-managed data sets, the expiration date in the catalog
I        is updated and the expiration date in the format-1 DSCB is
I        changed. Should the expiration date in the catalog not agree
I        with the expiration date in the VTOC, the VTOC entry overrides
I        the catalog entry. In this case, issue a LISTVTOC to see the
I        correct expiration date.
N
I        Exception: TO|FOR is not applicable for an OAM non-VSAM entry
I        and is ignored if specified. With OAM, a never-expire retention
I        is assigned to the entry which then requires you to specify
I        the PURGE parameter of the DELETE command to delete the OAM
I        non-VSAM entry.
N
I        TO(date): Specifies the earliest date that a command without
I          the PURGE parameter can delete the non-VSAM data set. Specify
I          the expiration date in the form yyyyddd, where yyyy is a
I          four-digit year (to a maximum of 2155) and ddd is the
I          three-digit day of the year from 001 through 365 (for
I          non-leap years) or 366 (for leap years).
N
I          The following four values are "never-expire" dates:
I          99365, 99366, 1999365, and 1999366. Specifying a
I          "never-expire" date means that the PURGE parameter will
I          always be required to delete the non-VSAM data set. For
I          related information, see the "EXPDT Parameter" section of
I          z/OS MVS JCL Reference, SA22-7597.
N
I          Notes:
N
I          1. Any dates with two-digit years (other than 99365 or 99366)
I             will be treated as pre-2000 dates. (See note 2.)
N
I          2. Specifying the current date or a prior date as the
I             expiration date will make the non-VSAM data set
I             immediately eligible for deletion.
N
D        FOR(days): specifies the number of days to keep the non-VSAM
I          data set being defined. The maximum number is 93000. If the
I          number is 0 through 92999 (except for 9999), the entry is
I          retained for the number of days indicated. If the number is
I          either 9999 or 93000, the entry is retained indefinitely.
I          There is a hardware imposed expiration date of 2155.
N
D    ) /* - */
N
M    CATALOG(catname) /* Abbreviation: CAT */
I      identifies the catalog in which the non-VSAM data set, or OAM
I      object is to be defined. Search "Catalog Selection Order for
I      DEFINE" for the order in which a catalog is selected when the
I      catalog's name is not specified.
N
I      catname/alias: Names the catalog or an alias that can be resolved
I        to a catalog. For example, if alias ABCD relates to catalog
I         SYS1.USERCAT, then specifying either ABCD or SYS1.USERCAT will
I         cause the cluster to be defined in SYS1.USERCAT.
N
I        If the catalog's volume is physically mounted, it is
I        dynamically allocated. Mount the volume as permanently
I        resident or reserved.
