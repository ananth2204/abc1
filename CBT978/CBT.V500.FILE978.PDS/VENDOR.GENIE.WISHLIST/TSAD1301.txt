NChapter 13: GETMAIN, FREEMAIN, STORAGE (GFS) trace
N--------------------------------------------------
NStarting and stopping GFS trace
N-------------------------------
NThe following procedure explains how to request a GFS trace.
N
N1. In the DIAGxx parmlib member, set the VSM TRACE GETFREE parameter to
N   ON and define the GFS trace control data.
N
NExample: DIAGxx parmlib member for starting GFS tracing
N-------------------------------------------------------
NThe following DIAGxx parmlib member starts GFS trace and limits the
Ntrace output to requests to obtain or release virtual storage that is
N24 bytes long and resides in address spaces 3, 5, 6, 7, 8 and 9:
N
IIn SYS1.PARMLIB(DIAG01):
DVSM TRACE GETFREE (ON)
DASID (3, 5-9)
DLENGTH (24)
DDATA (ALL)
N
N2. Ask the operator to enter the SET DIAG=01 command to activate GFS
N   trace using the definitions in the DIAGxx parmlib member.
N
N3. Start a GTF trace (ask the operator to enter a START membername
N   command on the operator console). membername is the name of the
N   member that contains the source JCL (either a cataloged procedure or
N   a job). Tell the operator to specify a user event identifier X'F65'
N   to trace GTF user trace records.
N
N4. To stop the GTF trace, ask the operator to enter a STOP procname
N   command on the operator console.
N
N5. To stop GFS trace, create a DIAGxx parmlib member with VSM TRACE
N   GETFREE(OFF) and have the operator enter a SET DIAG=xx command.
N
NExample: DIAGxx parmlib member for stopping GFS tracing
N-------------------------------------------------------
NTo stop GFS trace, create a DIAGxx parmlib member with VSM TRACE
GETFREE(OFF) and have the operator enter a SET DIAG=00 command.
IIn SYS1.PARMLIB(DIAG00):
DVSM TRACE GETFREE(OFF)
* End of WISH.
