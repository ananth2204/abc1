NChapter 11: Component trace
N---------------------------
NThe component trace service provides a way for MVS components to
Ncollect problem data about events. Each component that uses the
Ncomponent trace service has set up its trace in a way that provides
Nthe unique data needed for the component.
N
NA component trace provides data about events that occur in the
Ncomponent. The trace data is used by the IBM Support Center, which uses
Nthe trace data to:
N
N-> Diagnose problems in the component
N
N-> See how the component is running.
N
NYou will typically use component trace while recreating a problem.
