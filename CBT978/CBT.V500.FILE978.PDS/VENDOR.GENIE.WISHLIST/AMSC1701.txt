N----------------------------
NSyntax for DEFINE PAGESPACE Parameters
N--------------------------------------
D  DEFINE /* Abbreviation: DEF */ -
N
NRequired Parameters
N-------------------
D    PAGESPACE( /* Abbreviation: PGSPC */ -
I      specifies that a page space is to be defined.
N
I      Recommendation: Use the KILOBYTES or MEGABYTES option to specify
I      the amount of space for the DEFINE PAGESPACE command.
N
D      NAME(entryname) -
I        specifies the name of the page space being defined.
N
I      CYLINDERS(primary) | /* Abbreviation: CYL */ -
I      KILOBYTES(primary) | /* Abbreviation: KB */ -
I      MEGABYTES(primary) | /* Abbreviation: MB */ -
I      RECORDS(primary) | /* Abbreviation: REC */ -
I      TRACKS(primary) /* Abbreviation: TRK */ -
I        specifies the amount of space that is to be allocated. This
I        parameter is optional if the volume is managed by SMS. If it
I        is specified, it overrides the DATACLASS space specification.
I        If it is not specified, it must be modeled or defaulted by SMS.
I        If it cannot be determined, the DEFINE is unsuccessful.
N
I        If you specify KILOBYTES or MEGABYTES the amount of space
I        allocated is the minimum number of tracks or cylinders required
I        to contain the specified number of kilobytes or megabytes. The
I        maximum space can be specified with unit of KILOBYTES or
I        MEGABYTES is 16,777,215. If the amount requested exceeds this
I        value, you should specify a larger allocation unit.
N
I        If RECORDS or TRACKS is specified, the quantity specified is
I        rounded up to the nearest cylinder and the space is allocated
I        in cylinders.
N
I        To maintain device independence, do not specify the TRACKS or
I        CYLINDERS parameters. If TRACKS or CYLINDERS is specified for
I        an SMS-managed pagespace, space is allocated on the volume
I        selected by SMS in units equivalent to the device default
I        geometry.
N
M          These days the only mainframe DASD devices in use are
M          likely to be 3390 and thus the caution about device
M          independence is no longer applicable. If you have something
M          else it is way past time to migrate to the current geometry.
N
I        The amount of space need not be specified if the RECATALOG
I        parameter is specified.
N
I        To determine the exact amount of space allocated, list the
I        page space's catalog entry, using the LISTCAT command.
N
I        If you do not specify the MODEL parameter, you must specify
I        one, and only one, of the following parameters: CYLINDERS,
I        KILOBYTES, MEGABYTES, RECORDS, or TRACKS.
N
I        Note: Page data sets cannot be defined in cylinder-managed
I        space.
N
I        primary: Specifies the amount of space that is to be allocated
I          to the page space. After the primary extent is full, the
I          page space is full. The page space cannot extend onto
I          secondary extents. The maximum number of paging slots for
I          each page space is 16M. Page spaces regardless of their size
I          have the extended format and extended addressable attributes
I          assigned to them whether they are on an SMS managed volume
I          or a non-SMS managed volume.
N
D      VOLUME(volser) /* Abbreviation: VOL */ -
I        specifies the volume that contains the page space. If you do
I        not specify the MODEL parameter, or if the page space is not
I        SMS-managed, VOLUME must be specified as a parameter of
I        PAGESPACE.
N
I        VOLUME can be specified or modeled for a data set that is to
I        be SMS-managed, but be aware that the volume specified might
I        not be used and, in some cases, can result in an error. If
I        VOLUME is not specified for an SMS-managed data set, SMS
I        selects the volume. See z/OS DFSMSdfp Storage Administration
I        for information about SMS volume selection.
N
I        Nonspecific volumes are indicated for an SMS-managed data set
I        by coding an * for each volume serial. SMS then determines the
I        volume serial.
N
I        The VOLUME parameter interacts with other DEFINE PAGESPACE
I        parameters. Ensure that the volumes you specify for the page
I        space are consistent with the page space's other attributes:
N
I        -> The volume must contain enough unallocated space to satisfy
I           the page space's space requirement.
N
I        -> The volume information supplied with the DD statement
I           pointed to by FILE must be consistent with the information
I           specified for the page space.
N
NOptional Parameters
N-------------------
D      DATACLASS(class) /* Abbreviation: DATACLAS */ -
I        specifies the name, 1-to-8 characters, of the data class for
I        the data set. It provides the allocation attributes for new
I        data sets.
N
I        Your storage administrator defines the data class. However,
I        you can override the parameters defined for DATACLASS by
I        explicitly specifying other attributes. Search "Understanding
I        the Order of Assigned Data Set Attributes" for the order of
I        precedence (filtering) the system uses to select which
I        attribute to assign.
N
I        DATACLASS parameters apply to both SMS-managed and
I        non-SMS-managed data sets. If DATACLASS is specified and SMS
I        is inactive, DEFINE is unsuccessful.
N
D      FILE(ddname)
I        specifies the name of the DD statement that identifies the
I        device and volume to be allocated to the page space. If the
I        FILE parameter is not specified and the volume is physically
I        mounted, the volume identified with the VOLUME parameter is
I        dynamically allocated. The volume must be mounted as
I        permanently resident or reserved.
N
D      MANAGEMENTCLASS(class) /* Abbreviation: MGMTCLAS */ -
I        specifies, for SMS-managed data sets only, the 1-to-8
I        character name of the management class for a new data set.
I        Your storage administrator defines the names of the management
I        classes you can specify. If MANAGEMENTCLASS is not specified,
I        but STORAGECLASS is specified or defaulted, MANAGEMENTCLASS is
I        derived from automatic class selection (ACS). If
I        MANAGEMENTCLASS is specified and STORAGECLASS is not specified
I        or derived, the DEFINE is unsuccessful. If SMS is inactive and
I        MANAGEMENTCLASS is specified, the DEFINE is unsuccessful.
N
D      MODEL(entryname catname) -
I        Specifies that an existing page space entry is to be used as
I        a model for the entry being defined. It is possible to use an
I        already defined page space as a model for another page space.
I        When one entry is used as a model for another, its attributes
I        are copied as the new entry is defined.
N
I        You can use some attributes of the model and override others
I        by explicitly specifying them in the definition of the page
I        space. If you do not want to add or change any attributes, you
I        need specify only the entry type (page space) of the model to
I        be used and the name of the entry to be defined. Search
I        "Understanding the Order of Assigned Data Set Attributes" for
I        more information about the order in which the system selects
I        an attribute.
N
I        entryname: Specifies the name of the page space entry to be
I          used as a model.
N
I        catname:  Specifies the name of the catalog in which the entry
I          to be used as a model is defined.
N
D      OWNER(ownerid) -
I        specifies the identification of the owner of the page space.
N
D      RECATALOG | NORECATALOG /* Abbreviations: RCTLG and NRCTLG */ -
I        Specifies whether the catalog entries for the cluster
I        components are to be re-created or are to be created for the
I        first time.
N
I        RECATALOG /* Abbreviation: RCTLG */: If RECATALOG is specified,
I          the catalog entries are re-created if valid VVDS entries are
I          found on the primary VVDS volume. If valid VVDS entries are
I          not found on the primary VVDS volume, the command ends. For
I          information on resolving VVDS problems, see the text on
I          deleting VVDS records in z/OS DFSMS Managing Catalogs .
N
I          Specification of RECATALOG requires that the NAME and VOLUMES
I          parameters be specified as they were when the cluster was
I          originally defined.
N
I          The CYLINDERS|RECORDS|TRACKS parameter is not required if
I          RECATALOG is specified.
N
I          If the ATTEMPTS, AUTHORIZATION, CATALOG, MODEL or OWNER
I          parameters were specified during the original define, they
I          must be respecified with RECATALOG to restore their original
I          values; otherwise, their default values are used.
N
M            ATTEMPTS and AUTHORIZATION no longer appear as valid
M            parameters.
N
I        NORECATALOG /* Abbreviation: NRCTLG */: creates the catalog
I          entries for the first time.
N
D      STORAGECLASS(class) /* Abbreviation: STORCLAS */ -
I        For SMS-managed data sets: Specifies the name, 1-to-8
I        characters, of the storage class.
N
I        Your storage administrator defines the names of the storage
I        classes you can specify. A storage class is assigned if you
I        use STORAGECLASS or an ACS routine selects a storage class for
I        the new data set.
N
I        The storage class provides the storage attributes that are
I        specified on the UNIT and VOLUME operand for non-SMS-managed
I        data sets. Use the storage class to specify the storage
I        service level to be used by SMS for storage of the data set.
I        If SMS is inactive and STORAGECLASS is specified, the DEFINE
I        is unsuccessful.
N
D      TO(date) | FOR(days) -
I        specifies the retention period for the page space. If neither
I        TO nor FOR is specified, the page space can be deleted at any
I        time.
N
I        The expiration date in the catalog is updated and the
I        expiration date in the format-1 DSCB is changed. Should the
I        expiration date in the catalog not agree with the expiration
I        date in the VTOC, the VTOC entry overrides the catalog entry.
N
I        The MANAGEMENTCLASS maximum retention period, if specified,
I        limits the retention period specified by this parameter.
N
I        TO(date): Specifies the earliest date that a command without
I          the PURGE parameter can delete the page space data set.
I          Specify the expiration date in the form yyyyddd, where yyyy
I          is a four-digit year (to a maximum of 2155) and ddd is the
I          three-digit day of the year from 001 through 365 (for
I          non-leap years) or 366 (for leap years).
N
I          The following four values are "never-expire" dates:
I          99365, 99366, 1999365, and 1999366. Specifying a
I          "never-expire" date means that the PURGE parameter will
I          always be required to delete the page space data set. For
I          related information, see the "EXPDT Parameter" section of
I          z/OS MVS JCL Reference, SA22-7597.
N
I          Notes:
N
I          1. Any dates with two-digit years (other than 99365 or 99366)
I             will be treated as pre-2000 dates. (See note 2.)
N
I          2. Specifying the current date or a prior date as the
I             expiration date will make the page space data set
I             immediately eligible for deletion.
N
D        FOR(days): specifies the number of days to keep the page space.
I          The maximum number is 93000. If the number is 0 through 92999
I          (except for 9999), the entry is retained for the number of
I          days indicated. If the number is either 9999 or 93000, the
I          entry is retained indefinitely.
I          There is a hardware imposed expiration date of 2155.
N
D    ) /* - */
M    CATALOG(catname) /* Abbreviation: CAT */
I      The CATALOG parameter is allowed on the DEFINE PAGESPACE command
I      only when the RECATALOG keyword is also coded. To define a new
I      pagespace that is located in another master catalog (for example,
I      a target system master catalog), create an alias in the current
I      master catalog related to the target master catalog. Define the
I      pagespace using a data set name starting with the alias that was
I      created. Then rename the pagespace with the ALTER command,
I      specifying the CATALOG parameter on the ALTER command.
N
I      To specify catalog names for SMS-managed data sets, you must have
I      authority from the RACF STGADMIN.IGG.DIRCAT facility class.
I      Search "Storage Management Subsystem (SMS) Considerations" for
I      more information.
N
I      catname: Names the catalog or an alias that can be resolved
I        to a catalog. For example, if alias ABCD relates to catalog
I         SYS1.USERCAT, then specifying either ABCD or SYS1.USERCAT will
I         cause the cluster to be defined in SYS1.USERCAT.
N
I        If the catalog's volume is physically mounted, it is
I        dynamically allocated. Mount the volume as permanently
I        resident or reserved.
