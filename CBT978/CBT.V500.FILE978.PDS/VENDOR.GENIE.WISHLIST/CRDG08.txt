NChapter 8. DB2CONN resources
N----------------------------
NA DB2CONN definition defines the attributes of the connection between
NCICS and DB2, and of the pool threads and command threads used with the
Nconnection.
N
NInstalling DB2 connection definitions
N-------------------------------------
NThis section describes the guidelines for installing and discarding
NDB2CONN definitions and the implications of interruptions in partial
Nactivity.
N
NAbout this task
N---------------
N-> Only one DB2CONN can be installed in a CICS system at any one time.
N   An install of a second DB2CONN can implicitly DISCARD the existing
N   DB2CONN and its associated DB2ENTRYs and DB2TRANs (unless
N   reinstalling a DB2CONN of the same name) before proceeding with the
N   installation.
N
N-> A DB2CONN must be installed before any DB2ENTRY or DB2TRAN
N   definitions. DB2ENTRY and DB2TRAN definitions cannot exist on
N   their own, and can only be associated with a DB2CONN that is already
N   installed. Also, if you discard a DB2CONN, the associated DB2ENTRY
N   and DB2TRAN resource definitions are also discarded. Note that there
N   is no attribute on a DB2ENTRY or DB2TRAN that explicitly specifies
N   the DB2CONN to which they belong. This allows DB2ENTRY and DB2TRAN
N   definitions to be shared by DB2CONN definitions without alteration.
N
N   Note: When DB2CONN, DB2ENTRYs, and DB2TRANs are defined in the same
N   group, CICS automatically installs the DB2CONN first. If you install
N   DB2 definitions from multiple groups (by means of a list or multiple
N   INSTALL GROUP commands), the first group you install must contain
N   the DB2CONN definition. Successive groups should not have any
N   DB2CONN definitions. CICS issues an error message when installing
N   a DB2ENTRY or DB2TRAN when no DB2CONN is installed. If multiple
N   DB2CONN definitions are installed, all DB2 definitions installed
N   before the final DB2CONN definition are discarded. CICS issues
N   messages for all discards.
N
N-> A DB2CONN must be installed before the CICS DB2 connection can be
N   started. Because it contains information regarding pool threads and
N   command threads, as well as global type information, a DB2CONN
N   represents the minimum required to start the CICS DB2 connection.
N   There are no entry threads, and all transactions use the pool. You
N   can add DB2ENTRYs and DB2TRANs after the CICS DB2 connection is
N   active.
