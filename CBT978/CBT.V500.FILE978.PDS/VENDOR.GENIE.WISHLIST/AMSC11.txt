NChapter 11. DCOLLECT
N--------------------
nThe DFSMS Data Collection Facility (DCOLLECT) is a function of access
Nmethod services. DCOLLECT collects stored data set, volume and policy
Nvalues into a sequential file you can use as input to other programs
Nor applications.
N
NNote: There is a Report Generator option in the ISMF storage
NAdministrator primary panel 'G' Report Generator that can be used to
Ncreate reports based on the sequential file contents that DCOLLECT
Nproduces. The report generator ships sample report types for DCOLLECT,
Nboth DFSMSdfp and DFSMShsm DCOLLECT record types. In addition, it will
Nship some sample reports based on those.
N
NDCOLLECT obtains data on:
N
N-> Active Data Sets
N
N   DCOLLECT provides data about space use and data set attributes and
N   indicators on the selected volumes and storage groups.
N
N-> VSAM Data Set Information
N
N   DCOLLECT provides specific information relating to VSAM data sets
N   residing on the selected volumes and storage groups.
N
N-> Volumes
N
N   DCOLLECT provides statistics and information on volumes that are
N   selected for collection.
N
N-> Inactive Data
N
N   DCOLLECT produces output for DFSMShsm-managed data, (inactive data
N   management), which includes both migrated and backed up data sets.
N
N   -> Migrated Data Sets: DCOLLECT provides information on space
N      utilization and data set attributes for data sets migrated by
N      DFSMShsm.
N
N   -> Backed Up Data Sets: DCOLLECT provides information on space
N      utilization and data set attributes for every version of a data
N      set backed up by DFSMShsm.
N
N-> Capacity Planning
N
N   Capacity planning for DFSMShsm-managed data (inactive data
N   management) includes the collection of both DASD and tape capacity
N   planning.
N
N   -> DASD Capacity Planning: DCOLLECT provides information and
N      statistics for volumes managed by DFSMShsm (ML0 and ML1).
N
N   -> Tape Capacity Planning: DCOLLECT provides statistics for tapes
N      managed by DFSMShsm.
N
N-> SMS Configuration Information
N
N   DCOLLECT provides information about the SMS configurations. The
N   information can be from either an active control data set (ACDS)
N   or a source control data set (SCDS), or the active configuration.
N
N   DCOLLECT provides attributes that are in the selected configuration
N   for the following:
N
N   -> Data Class Constructs
N   -> Storage Class Constructs
N   -> Management Class Constructs
N   -> Storage Group Constructs
N   -> SMS Volume Information
N   -> SMS Base Configuration Information
N   -> Aggregate Group Construct Information
N   -> Optical Drive Information
N   -> Optical Library Information
N   -> Cache Names
N   -> Accounting Information for the ACS routines
N
NRestriction: Use the DCOLLECT command only with volumes that contain
Nan MVS VTOC. If you use the DCOLLECT command with volumes that contain
Na VM VTOC, the DCOLLECT command fails and error message IDC21804I is
Ndisplayed.
N
NFor information on calling DCOLLECT from ISMF, see z/OS DFSMSdfp
NStorage Administration. For information on using DCOLLECT to monitor
Nspace usage, see Using the Data Collection Application in z/OS DFSMSdfp
NStorage Administration.
