NExample 2: Punch Sequential Data Sets
N-------------------------------------
NIn this example, a sequential data set is punched according to
Nuser specifications.
N
D//PHSEQNO  JOB ...
D//ST01#01 EXEC PGM=IEBPTPCH
D//SYSPRINT  DD SYSOUT=*
D//SYSUT1    DD DISP=(SHR,KEEP),DSN=MASTER.SEQSET
D//SYSUT2    DD SYSOUT=B
D//SYSIN     DD *
D         PUNCH MAXFLDS=1,CDSEQ=0,CDINCR=20
D         RECORD FIELD=(72)
D         LABELS DATA=YES
D/*
N
NThe control statements are discussed below:
N
N  SYSUT1 DD defines the input data set, MASTER.SEQSET, which resides
N  on a disk or tape volume. The data set contains 80-byte, fixed
N  blocked records.
N
N  SYSUT2 DD defines the system output class (punch is assumed). That
N  portion of each record from the input data set defined by the FIELD
N  parameter is represented by one punched card.
N
N  SYSIN DD defines the control data set, which follows in the input
N  stream.
N
N  PUNCH begins the punch operation, indicates that one FIELD parameter
N  is included in a subsequent RECORD statement (MAXFLDS=1), and
N  assigns a sequence number for the first punched card (00000000) and
N  an increment value for successive sequence numbers (20). Sequence
N  numbers are placed in columns 73 through 80 of the output records.
N
N  RECORD indicates that positions 1 through 72 of the input records
N  are to be punched. Bytes 73 through 80 of the input records are
N  replaced by the new sequence numbers in the output card deck.
N
N  LABELS specifies that user header labels and user trailer labels are
N  punched.
I
I  Labels cannot be edited; they are always moved to the first 80 bytes
I  of the output buffer. No sequence numbers are present on the cards
I  containing user header and user trailer records.
* End of WISH.
