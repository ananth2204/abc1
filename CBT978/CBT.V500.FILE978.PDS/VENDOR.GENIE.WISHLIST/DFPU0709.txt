NExample 9: Build a New Copy Modification Module from an Existing Copy
N---------------------------------------------------------------------
N3800 Model 3
N
NIn this example, a copy of an existing copy modification module, RTO1,
Nis used as the basis for a new copy modification module. The new module
Nis added to the SYS1.IMAGELIB data set as a new member. The existing
Nmodule, RTO1, remains unchanged and available for use.

NThe control statements are discussed below:
N
N  The SYSUT1 DD statement includes DISP=OLD to ensure that no other
N  job can modify the data set while this job is executing.
N
N  The INCLUDE statement specifies that a copy of the copy modification
N  module named RTO1 is used as a basis for the new module, and that
N  the first modification segment of RTO1 is to be deleted from the
N  copy.
N
N  OVERRUN=8 in the OPTION statement specifies that the IEBIMAGE
N  program is to print a warning message if the copy modification could
N  cause a line overrun condition when printing at 6 and 8 lines per
N  inch. The program is also to suppress any warning messages that
N  apply to printing at 10 and 12 lines per inch. DEVICE=3800M3 in the
N  OPTION statement specifies 3800 Model 3 compatibility mode
N  processing.
N
N  The COPYMOD statement specifies text that applies to each page of
N  the second, third, and fourth copies of the output data set:
N  LINES=(52,6) and POS=100 specify that the text is to be on the 52nd
N  line and repeated for the 53rd through 57th lines of each page,
N  starting at the 100th print position from the left.
N
N  The TEXT statement specifies the text in hexadecimal form: eight
N  blanks followed by two asterisks (in this example, the assumption is
N  made that X'40' prints as a blank and that X'5C' prints as an
N  asterisk; in actual practice, the character arrangement table used
N  with the copy modification module might translate X'40' and X'5C' to
N  other printable characters).
N
N  The name of the new copy modification module is AP; it is stored as
N  a member of the SYS1.IMAGELIB data set.
