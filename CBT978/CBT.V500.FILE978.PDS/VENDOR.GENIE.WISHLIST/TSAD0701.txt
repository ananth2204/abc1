NProblem data for storage overlays
N---------------------------------
NAlways be aware of the possibility of a storage overlay when analyzing
Na dump. System problems in MVS are often caused by storage overlays
Nthat destroy data, control blocks, or executable code. The results of
Nsuch an overlay vary. For example:
N
N-> The system detects an error and issues an abend code, yet the error
N   can be isolated to an address space. Isolating the error is
N   important in discovering whether the overlay is in global or local
N   storage.
N
N-> Referencing the data or instructions can cause an immediate error
N   such as a specification exception (abend X'0C4') or operation code
N   exception (abend X'0C1').
N
N-> The bad data is used to reference a second location, which then
N   causes another error.
N
NWhen you recognize that the contents of a storage location are not
Nvalid and subsequently recognize the bit pattern as a certain control
Nblock or piece of data, you generally can identify the erroneous
Nprocess/component and start a detailed analysis.
