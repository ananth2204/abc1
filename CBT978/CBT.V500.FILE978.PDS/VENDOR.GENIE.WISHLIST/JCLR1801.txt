NINCLUDE Statement
N=================
NUse the INCLUDE statement to:
N
N->Identify the name of the member of a partitioned data set (PDS) or
N  partitioned data set extended (PDSE) that contains a set of JCL
N  statements (such as DD and OUTPUT JCL statements) called an INCLUDE
N group.
N
N->Imbed the INCLUDE group in the JCL stream at the position of the
N  INCLUDE statement.
N
NThe INCLUDE group replaces the INCLUDE statement, and the system
Nprocesses the imbedded JCL statements as part of the JCL stream. The
NJCL statements, which are subject to all JCL processing rules, must
Nbe complete statements; that is, you cannot use an imbedded statement
Nto continue the statement that precedes INCLUDE.
N
D//INC1 INCLUDE MEMBER=name comments
N
NExample A: Copy in a non-PROC member.
N=====================================
NPulls in JCL from a member of your JCLLIB specification or the
Nconcatenation of PROCLIBs as defined by your installation.
N
D//PROCS JCLLIB ORDER=(&SYSUID..JES.PROCLIB)
