N-----------------------------------------
NExample 8: Loading a Data Set
N-----------------------------
NIn this example, a sequential data set that was created by an IEBCOPY
Nunload operation is loaded.
N
D//LOAD     JOB ...
D//ST01#01 EXEC PGM=IEBCOPY
D//SYSPRINT  DD SYSOUT=*
D//SYSUT1    DD DISP=(OLD),DSN=UNLOADSET
D//SYSUT2    DD DISP=(NEW,CATLG),DSN=DATASET4,
D//             UNIT=disk,
D//             SPACE=(CYL,(10,5,10))
D//SYSUT3    DD DISP=(NEW,DELETE),DSN=&&TEMP1,
D//             UNIT=disk,
D//             SPACE=(80,(15,1))
D//SYSIN     DD DUMMY

NThe control statements are discussed below:
N
N  SYSUT1 DD defines a sequential data set that was previously created
N  by an IEBCOPY unload operation. The data set contains 28 members in
N  sequential organization.
N
N  SYSUT2 DD defines a new partitioned data set on a disk volume. This
N  data set is to be kept after the load operation. Ten cylinders are
N  allocated for the data set; ten blocks are allocated for directory
N  entries.
N
N  SYSUT3 DD defines a temporary spill data set on a disk volume.
N
N  SYSIN DD defines the control data set. Because SYSIN is dummied,
N  SYSUT1 defines a sequential data set, and SYSUT2 defines a
N  partitioned data set, the entire SYSUT1 data set will be loaded into
N  the SYSUT2 data set.
