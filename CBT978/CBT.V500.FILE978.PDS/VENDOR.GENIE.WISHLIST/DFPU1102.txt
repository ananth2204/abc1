NExample 2: Create a Three-Member Library
N----------------------------------------
NIn this example, a three-member partitioned library is created. The
Ninput data is contained solely in the control data set.

NThe control statements are discussed below:
N
N  SYSUT2 DD defines the new partitioned master, OUTLIB. Enough space
N  is allocated to allow for subsequent modifications without creating a
N  new master data set.
N
N  SYSIN DD defines the control data set, which follows in the input
N  stream. The data set contains the utility control statements and the
N  data to be placed as three members in the output partitioned data
N  set.
N
N  The ADD function statements indicate that subsequent data statements
N  are to be placed as members in the output partitioned data set. Each
N  ADD function statement specifies a member name for subsequent data
N  and indicates that the member and control statement is listed in the
N  message data set.
N
N  The data statements contain the data to be placed in each member of
N  the output partitioned data set.
N
N  ENDUP signals the end of control data set input.
M
MBecause sequence numbers (other than blank numbers) are included within
Mthe data statements, no NUMBER detail statements are included in the
Mexample.
