NExample 10: Alter Load Modules in Place
N---------------------------------------
NIn this example, all members of data set MODLIBJ, members MODX, MODY,
Nand MODZ of data set MODLIBK, and all members of data set MODLIBL,
Nexcept MYMACRO and MYJCL, are altered in place.

NThe control statements are discussed below:
N
N  LIBJ DD defines the partitioned data set MODLIBJ, which has been
N  previously created and cataloged.
N
N  LIBK DD defines the partitioned data set MODLIBK, which has been
N  previously created and cataloged.
N
N  LIBL DD defines the partitioned data set MODLIBL, which has been
N  previously created and cataloged.
N
N  SYSIN DD defines the control data set, which follows in the input
N  stream.
N
N  The first ALTERMOD statement specifies that the entire data set
N  defined in LIBJ is to be altered in place.
N
N  The second ALTERMOD statement plus the following SELECT statement
N  indicates that members MODX, MODY, and MODZ are to be altered in
N  place. The remainder of MODLIBK is unchanged.
N
N  The third ALTERMOD statement plus the following EXCLUDE statement
N  indicates that all of MODLIBL is to be altered in place except the
N  members called MYMACRO and MYJCL. These members remain unchanged.
* End of WISH.
