NChapter 10: The Generalized Trace Facility (GTF)
N------------------------------------------------
NCustomizing GTF
N---------------
NYou can customize GTF to the needs of your installation by either
Noverriding IBM's defaults through the START GTF command, or providing
Nyour own parmlib member and cataloged procedure for GTF.
N
NDefining GTF trace options
N--------------------------
NIf you supply your own parmlib member or data set containing GTF trace
Noptions, you can select any of the options listed in
N"GTF trace options" Each instance of GTF can be activated with the same
Nor different set of options.
N
NThe member containing predefined trace options does not have to reside
Nin the parmlib member. GTF will accept any data set specified in the
NSYSLIB DD statement of the cataloged procedure, or in the START
Ncommand, as long as that data set's attributes are compatible with
Nthose of SYS1.PARMLIB.

NSetting up a cataloged procedure
N--------------------------------
NSet up your own GTF cataloged procedure when you want to control
Ndetails of GTF operation such as:
N
N-> Amount of storage needed for tracing
N
N-> Recovery for GTF
N
N-> Number and type of trace output data sets.
N
D//             PARM='parm, parm...'
I               Options specified on the PARM parameter specify where GTF
I               writes trace data and the amount of storage needed for
I               GTF to collect and save trace data in various dump types.
I
I               parm can be any of the following:
I
D               MODE={INT|EXT|DEFER}
I                 Defines where GTF writes the trace data.
I                 MODE=INT directs data to a trace table in virtual
I                 storage, and MODE=EXT directs data to a data set on
I                 tape or DASD. MODE=DEFER will place the trace data in
I                 the GTF address space until you enter the STOP GTF
I                 command.
N
D               SADMP={nnnnnnK|nnnnnnM|40K}
I                 Specifies the amount of storage needed to save GTF
I                 trace data for stand-alone dumps.
N
D               SDUMP={nnnnnnK|nnnnnnM|40K}
I                 Specifies the amount of storage needed to save GTF
I                 trace data for SVC dumps.
N
D               NOPROMPT
I                 If specified, indicates that you will not be prompted
I                 to specify trace options. Message AHL125A and AHL100A
I                 will not be issued. Use this parameter when you have a
I                 parmlib member set up with the desired GTF options and
I                 you want to avoid multiple replies in a sysplex
I                 environment.
N
D               ABDUMP={nnnnnnK|nnnnnnM|0K}
I                 Specifies the amount of GTF trace data to be formatted
I                 in an ABEND or SNAP dump.
N
D               BLOK={nnnnn|nnnnnK|nnnnnM|40K}
I                 Specifies the amount of virtual storage (E)CSA that GTF
I                 will use to collect trace data.
N
D               SIZE={nnnnnnK|nnnnnnM|1024K}
I                 Specifies the size of the buffers.
N
D               TIME=YES
I                 Specifies that every GTF trace record have a time
I                 stamp, as well as the block time stamp associated with
I                 every block of data. The time stamp is the eight-byte
I                 time of day (TOD) clock value at the local time in
I                 which GTF puts the record into the trace table.
N
D               DEBUG={YES|NO}
I                 Specifies whether GTF should attempt recovery after it
I                 encounters an error. If DEBUG=YES, GTF will not attempt
I                 any recovery. Instead, GTF will issue an error message
I                 and end after encountering any error, so that the
I                 contents of the trace table immediately prior to the
I                 error remain intact.
I
I                 If DEBUG=NO, which is the default, GTF does the
I                 following:
I
I                 -> For errors in GTF processing, GTF continues
I                    processing after doing one or more of the following:
I
I                    - Flagging the trace record or trace record field
I                      associated with the error
I
I                    - Issuing a message to the console to inform that an
I                      error occurred
I
I                    - Suppressing the error or function in which the
I                      error occurred.
I
I                 -> For errors that do not occur in GTF itself, GTF ends
I                    abnormally. If GTF stops processing, that will not
I                    cause any other task to also stop.

NGuidelines for defining GTF trace output data sets in a cataloged
Nprocedure
N-----------------------------------------------------------------
NThe trace output data sets must be specific to each instance of GTF and
Ncan be defined in the cataloged procedure. Each instance of GTF to be
Nstarted must have a separate cataloged procedure, or if the same
Ncataloged procedure is used, then a different trace data set must be
Nsupplied with the START command.
N
N
NDetermining GTF's storage requirements
N--------------------------------------
NThe storage that GTF requires depends on the trace options you choose.
N
NThere are several types of storage to calculate:
N
N-> Extended pageable link pack area (EPLPA)
N
N-> System queue area (SQA)
N
N-> Extended common service area (ECSA)
N
N-> Region storage
N
MAt this point you should refer to the manual.
