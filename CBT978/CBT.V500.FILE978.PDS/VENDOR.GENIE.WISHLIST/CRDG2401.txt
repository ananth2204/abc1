NChapter 24. PROCESSTYPE resources
N---------------------------------
NSyntax:
N-------
D  DEFINE
D    PROCESSTYPE(name)
I      Specifies the name of this PROCESSTYPE definition.
N
I      The name can be up to eight characters in length. Leading and
I      embedded blank characters are not permitted. If the name supplied
I      is less than eight characters, it is padded with trailing blanks
I      up to eight characters.
N
D    GROUP(groupname)
I      Every resource definition must have a GROUP name.
I      The resource definition becomes a member of the group and is
I      installed in the CICS system when the group is installed.
N
I      The GROUP name can be up to 8 characters in length. Lowercase
I      characters are treated as uppercase characters.
N
D    DESCRIPTION(text)
I      You can provide a description of the resource that
I      you are defining in this field. The description text can be up to
I      58 characters in length. No restrictions apply to the characters
I      that you can use. However, if you use parentheses, ensure that for
I      each left parenthesis there is a matching right parenthesis. If you
I      use the CREATE command, for each single apostrophe in the text,
I      code two apostrophes.
N
D    AUDITLEVEL(OFF | ACTIVITY | FULL | PROCESS)
I      Specifies the initial level
I      of audit logging for processes of this type. If you specify any
I      value other than OFF, you must also specify the AUDITLOG option.
N
I      ACTIVITY: Activity-level auditing. Audit records will be written
I        from:
N
I      1. The process audit points
N
I      2. The activity primary audit points.
N
I      FULL: Full auditing. Audit records will be written from:
N
I      1. The process audit points
N
I      2. The activity primary and secondary audit points.
N
I      OFF: No audit trail records will be written.
N
I      PROCESS: Process-level auditing. Audit records will be written
I        from the process audit points only.
N
I      For details of the records that are written from the process,
I      activity primary, and activity secondary audit points, see the
I      CICS Business Transaction Services.
N
D    AUDITLOG(journal)
I      Specifies the name of a CICS journal to which
I      audit trail records will be written, for processes of this type
I      and their constituent activities. The name can be up to eight
I      characters long. If you do not specify an audit log, no audit
I      records will be kept for processes of this type.
N
D    FILE(file)
I      Specifies the name of the CICS file definition that will
I      be used to write the process and activity records of this
I      process-type to its associated repository data set. The name can
I      be up to eight characters long.
N
D    STATUS(ENABLED | DISABLED)
I      Specifies the initial status of the
I      process-type following a CICS initialization with START=COLD or
I      START=INITIAL. After initialization, you can use the
I      CEMT SET PROCESSTYPE command to change the status of the
I      process-type.
N
I      The status of the process-type following a restart is recovered
I      to its status at the previous shutdown.
N
I      DISABLED: Processes of this type cannot be created. An
I        EXEC CICS DEFINE ROCESS request that tries to create a process
I        of this type results in the INVREQ condition being returned
I        to the application program.
N
I      ENABLED: Processes of this type can be created.
