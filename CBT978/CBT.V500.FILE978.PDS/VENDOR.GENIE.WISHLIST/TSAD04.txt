NChapter 4: Stand-Alone dump
N---------------------------
NThe stand-alone dump program (SADMP) produces a stand-alone dump of
Nstorage that is occupied by one of the following:
N
N-> A system that failed.
N-> A stand-alone dump program that failed.
N
NEither the stand-alone dump program dumped itself a self-dump,
Nor the operator loaded another stand-alone dump program to dump the
Nfailed stand-alone dump program.
N
NThe stand-alone dump program and the stand-alone dump together form
Nwhat is known as the stand-alone dump service aid. The term stand-alone
Nmeans that the dump is performed separately from normal system
Noperations and does not require the system to be in a condition for
Nnormal operation.
