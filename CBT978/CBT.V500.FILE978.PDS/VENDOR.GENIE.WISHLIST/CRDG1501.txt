NChapter 15. JOURNALMODEL resources
N----------------------------------
NSyntax:
N-------
D  DEFINE
D    JOURNALMODEL(name)
I      Specifies the name of this JOURNALMODEL
I      definition. The journal model name is used to refer to a specific
I      JOURNALMODEL definition in the CSD file it does not have to
I      correspond to a CICS journal name. However, the JOURNALMODEL name
I      is also used as the JOURNALNAME if you omit the JOURNALNAME
I      attribute.
N
I      The name can be up to eight characters in length.
N
D    GROUP(groupname)
I      Every resource definition must have a GROUP name.
I      The resource definition becomes a member of the group and is
I      installed in the CICS system when the group is installed.
N
I      The GROUP name can be up to 8 characters in length. Lowercase
I      characters are treated as uppercase characters.
N
D    DESCRIPTION(text)
I      You can provide a description of the resource that
I      you are defining in this field. The description text can be up to
I      58 characters in length. No restrictions apply to the characters
I      that you can use. However, if you use parentheses, ensure that for
I      each left parenthesis there is a matching right parenthesis. If you
I      use the CREATE command, for each single apostrophe in the text,
I      code two apostrophes.
N
D    JOURNALNAME(journal)
I      Specifies the journal names to which this
I      definition applies. If you omit the JOURNALNAME attribute, the name
I      you specify on the JOURNALMODEL attribute is used as the journal
I      name. Name can be either the specific name of a journal or a
I      generic name, although using a generic name for system log and
I      log-of-logs models does not serve much purpose.
N
I      The name can be up to eight characters in length.
N
I      The forms of the names you can define are as follows:
N
I      For system logs
I      ---------------
I        To define a JOURNALMODEL for system logs, specify the name as
I        DFHLOG for the primary system log stream, and as DFHSHUNT for
I        the secondary log stream. Install one journal model only for
I        each of these log streams in a CICS region.
N
I        CICS-supplied definitions for DFHLOG, DFHSHUNT, and DFHLGLOG are
I        contained in group DFHLGMOD in DFHLIST.
N
I      For log-of-logs
I      ---------------
I        To define a JOURNALMODEL for the log-of-logs, specify the name
I        as DFHLGLOG. See the CICS System Definition Guide for more
I        information about the purpose of the log of logs.
N
I      For autojournals
I      ----------------
I        For autojournals (file control and terminal control), the name
I        must be of the form DFHJnn where nn is a number in the range 1
I        through 99.
N
I        The name can be either the specific name of a journal or a
I        generic name.
N
I      For user journals
I      -----------------
I        For user journals, the name can be up to 8 characters, and can be
I        either the specific name of a journal or a generic name. If
I        compatibility with releases earlier than CICS Transaction Server
I        for z/OS, is required, the name must be of the form DFHJnn where
I        nn is a number in the range 1 through 99.
N
I      For forward recovery logs (non-RLS)
I      -----------------------------------
I        For non-RLS forward recovery logs, the name must be of the form
I        DFHJnn where nn is a number in the range 1 through 99. The name
I        can be either the specific name of a journal or a generic name.
N
I      Note: You cannot define a journal model for use with VSAM RLS
I      forward recovery logs. CICS obtains the fully-qualified LSN
I      directly from the VSAM catalog, and therefore does not need a
I      journal model to obtain the LSN.
N
I      You define generic names, using the special symbols %, +, and *,
I      as follows:
N
I      -> You can use the % or + symbols to represent any single
I         character within a journal name.
N
I      -> You can use the * symbol at end of a name to represent any
I         number of characters. A default name of a single * is used to
I         match any journal names that do match on a more specific name.
N
I      If there are several installed JOURNALMODEL definitions that match
I      a journal name, CICS chooses the best match as follows:
N
I      1. If there is a JOURNALMODEL with a specific JOURNALNAME that
I         exactly matches, CICS uses this model.
N
I      2. If there is no exact match, the journal name is compared with
I         the matching generic entries and the most specific entry is
I         used.
N
I        In comparing names to see which one is more specific, the names
I        are compared character by character. Where they first differ:
N
I        -> If one has a discrete character (not %, +, or *) and the other
I           has a generic character (%, +, or *) the one with the discrete
I           character is used.
N
I        -> If one has a % or a + and the other has a *, the one with % or
I           + is used.
N
I      3. If there are duplicate JOURNALMODEL definitions (that is,
I         definitions with the same JOURNALNAME), CICS uses the last one
I         processed.
N
I      Attention: Take care when defining a completely generic journal
I      name using only the single asterisk (*). This is particularly
I      important if you have not defined a specific journal model for
I      the system log (using journal name DFHLOG), and the log stream
I      name is a fully-qualified literal name. If you define a journal
I      model with JOURNALNAME(*) and do not define a journal model for
I      the system log, CICS uses the log stream name defined on the
I      generic model definition. This causes problems if other journals
I      and forward recovery logs are assigned to the same log stream by
I      means of the generic journal model.
N
D    STREAMNAME(&USERID..&APPLID..&JNAME. | stream_name_template)
I      Specifies either an explicit MVS system logger log stream name,
I      or a template used to construct the log stream name. STREAMNAME
I      is applicable only to journal models defined with a LOGSTREAMTYPE
I      of MVS.
N
I      The four symbolic names, from which you can use a maximum of three,
I      are:
N
I        &USERID.: The symbolic name for the CICS region userid, which
I          can be up to eight characters. If the region does not have a
I          userid, the string 'CICS' will be used.
N
I        &APPLID.: The symbolic name for the CICS region APPLID as
I          specified on the system initialization parameter, and which
I          can be up to eight characters.
N
I          Note: If you are using XRF and you specify the APPLID system
I          initialization parameter as
I          APPLID=(generic_applid,specific_applid), it is the generic
I          applid that CICS uses when resolving &APPLID..
N
I        &JNAME.: The symbolic name for a journal name that references,
I          either by a specific or generic match, this journal model
I          definition. &JNAME. can be up to eight characters in length.
N
I        &SYSID.: The symbolic name for the CICS region SYSID as specified
I          on the SYSIDNT system initialization parameter. If SYSIDNT is
I          not specified, the string 'CICS' will be used.
N
I        The default set of symbolic names is: &USERID..&APPLID..&JNAME.
N
I        For Example:
I        ------------
I        &USERID..&APPLID..&JNAME. = CICSHA##.CICSHAA1.DFHJ02
N
I        where:
I          CICSHA## is the CICS region userid used by all the AORs.
I          CICSHAA1 is the applid of one AOR.
I          DFHJ02 is the journal name of an auto journal.
N
I        An alternative set of symbolic names could be:
I          &SYSID..&APPLID..&JNAME. = SYSA.CICSHAA1.DFHJ02
N
I        where:
I          SYSA is the character string as specified by the SYSIDNT
I            system initialization parameter.
I          CICSHAA1 is the applid of one AOR.
I          DFHJ02 is the journal name of an auto journal.
N
I      CICS installs the JOURNALMODEL resource as defined, including the
I      symbolic names.
N
I      stream_name_template
I      --------------------
I        A log stream name can be either an unqualified name or a
I        qualified name, as defined for MVS data set names:
N
I        -> Unqualified name: 1 through 8 alphanumeric or national
I           characters ($ # @), or a hyphen. The first character of the
I           name must be alphabetic or national (A-Z $ # @).
N
I        -> Qualified name: Multiple names joined by periods, up to a
I           maximum of 26 characters. Each name in a qualified name must
I           follow the rules for an unqualified name, with each qualified
I           name (except the last) followed by a period. For example,
N
I           name_1.name_2...name_n
I           where the number of names is restricted by the 26-character
I           limit.
N
I           For more information about the rules for qualified and
I           unqualified data set names, see z/OS MVS JCL Reference.
N
I        You can construct log stream names consisting of a mixture of
I        specific characters (from within the allowed set), and symbolic
I        names for substitution. After substitution, the name must meet
I        the rules for qualified and unqualified log stream names, and
I        must not exceed 26 characters, including periods. Thus, if each
I        name in a qualified name uses the maximum of eight characters,
I        you are restricted to three names only, with the first and
I        second names, and the second and third names separated by a
I        period. For example:
N
I          CICSDA##.CICSDAA1.FWDRECOV
N
I        for a forward recovery log stream. The log stream name is
I        determined by symbolic substitution when a journal name is first
I        resolved to a JOURNALMODEL definition.
N
I      By specifying the same log stream name for multiple CICS general
I      logs, you can merge the log streams from different CICS regions.
I      However, you cannot merge general log streams with the CICS system
I      log, nor can you merge system logs from different CICS regions.
N
I      When merging log streams from different CICS systems, the log data
I      blocks are written to their log streams in strict MVS system logger
I      time-stamp sequence. However, the individual records from different
I      CICS regions may not be in strict time-stamp sequence across
I      different blocks.
N
I      CICS log streams should not be merged with log streams generated
I      by other products unless any programs that read the log stream are
I      prepared to handle the formats.
N
I      Security note: When you have defined a log stream name to CICS and
I      the MVS system logger, you must ensure that the required security
I      authorizations are defined to RACF (or an equivalent external
I      security manager). This security authorization is necessary before
I      you attempt to start a CICS region that references a new log
I      stream. RACF supports the LOGSTRM general resource class for this
I      purpose.
N
D    TYPE(MVS | DUMMY | SMF)
I      Specifies where the journal records are to be
I      written. It can be up to five characters, and can have the
I      following values:
N
I      DUMMY: No log records are to be written. For example, you can use
I        this to suppress unwanted log records without changing an
I        application, or without changing file or profile resource
I        definitions.
N
I        If you do not want a system log or a log-of-logs, specify DUMMY
I        on the JOURNALMODEL definitions for the DFHLOG, DFHSHUNT, and
I        DFHLGLOG, as required.
N
I      MVS: Records are to be written to an MVS system logger log stream.
I        The name of the log stream is specified in the STREAMNAME
I        attribute.
N
I      SMF: Journal records are to be written in SMF format to the MVS
I        SMF log instead of to an MVS system logger log stream.
N
I        Note: SMF is not allowed for the CICS system log or for forward
I        recovery logs.
N
NThe default JOURNALMODEL
N------------------------
NIf CICS cannot find an installed JOURNALMODEL definition, it assumes
Na set of default attributes.
N
NThe attributes used are those of the following "built-in" default
Ndefinition:
N
I  DEFINE JOURNALMODEL(OTHERS) GROUP(LOGS)
I    JOURNALNAME(*)
I    STREAMNAME(&USERID..&APPLID..&JNAME.)
I    TYPE(MVS)
N
NJOURNALNAME(*) is the default journal model that CICS uses if there
Nis no matching JOURNALMODEL entry for a journal name.
* End of WISH.
