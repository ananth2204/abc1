NAccess Method Services for Catalogs
N-----------------------------------
NChapter 1. Using Access Method Services
N---------------------------------------
NIdentifying Data Sets and Volumes
N---------------------------------
NWhen you use access method services commands, you must identify
Ndata sets and volumes. Data sets must be identified when they are
Naccessed. Volumes must be identified when the system accesses the
Nvolume table of contents (VTOC), allocates or releases space or
Naccesses a VSAM volume data set (part of the catalog).
N
NVSAM data sets or volumes can be identified through the ALLOCATE
Ncommand, through job control language (JCL), or by the data set name
Nor volume serial number within the command that requires the data set
Nor volume for its execution. If you do not use JCL or the ALLOCATE
Ncommand, an attempt is made to dynamically allocate the data set or
Nvolume as required.
N
NUnder the SMS, you should not explicitly identify volumes. The
Nsystem identifies the necessary volumes when a storage class is
Nassigned to the data set. You can allocate your data set to a
Nspecific volume only if your storage administrator has set
NGUARANTEED SPACE=YES in the storage class assigned to your data set.
NSee z/OS DFSMSdfp Storage Administration for further information
Nabout SMS volume selection.
N
NDynamic Allocation
N------------------
NYou can dynamically allocate a data set if the data set name exists
Nand is cataloged. The catalog containing the entry must have a name
Nor alias that matches one or more of the qualifiers of the qualified
Ndata set name. All referenced catalogs must be connected to the
Nsystem master catalog.
N
NAccess method services does not support the S99TIOEX, S99ACUCB, and
NS99DSABA options of dynamic allocation. These three options are called
Nthe XTIOT, UCB nocapture and DSAB-above-the-line options. This
Nrestriction applies to the required SYSIN and SYSPRINT data sets and
Nto the DD names that are identified by keywords on the commands.
N
NThis restriction does not apply to data sets that are handled by the
Nuser routines that are described in "User I/O Routines".
N
NAccess method services dynamically allocates VSAM and non-VSAM data
Nsets with a disposition of OLD.
N
NJCL DD Statements
N-----------------
NWhen you use a JCL DD statement to identify a data set, include this
Non the DD statement:
N
N-> User data set name
N
N-> Catalog name of the BCS
N
N-> VVDS name
N
N-> Unit and volume serial numbers, if the data set is not cataloged
N
N-> Disposition
N
N-> AMP='AMORG' is required for VVDSs
N
NJCL DD Statement for a VSAM Data Set
N------------------------------------
NYou can allocate VSAM data sets directly with the access method
Nservices ALLOCATE command. The following DD statements demonstrate
Ntwo additional methods of describing and allocating a VSAM data set:
N
N-> For allocating and creating a new data set:
N
I//ddname    DD DISP=(NEW,CATLG),DSNAME=dsname,
I//             RECORG=KS,
I//             SPACE=(TRK,10,10),STORCLAS=xxxxx
N
N-> For allocating an existing data set:
N
I//ddname DD DISP=OLD,DSNAME=dsname
N
NAccess method services does not provide protection for data sets in a
Nshared environment. Therefore, you should use DISP=OLD on the DD
Nstatement for any data set that can be accessed improperly in a shared
Nenvironment.
N
NJCL DD Statement for a Volume
N-----------------------------
NTo identify and allocate a volume, include:
N
N->  Volume serial number
N
N->  Disposition
N
N->  Unit
N
NThis DD statement identifies and allocates volume VSER01:
N
I//VOLDD     DD DISP=OLD,UNIT=3380,VOL=SER=VSER01
N
NFor information on concatenated DD statements, see the FILE parameter
Ndescriptions in Chapter 3, "Functional Command Syntax". Examples using
Nconcatenated DD statements follow the description of the REPRO command
Nthat begins on Chapter 30, "REPRO". For additional information about
Nthe various types of concatenated DD statements, see the section on
Nspecial DD statements in z/OS MVS JCL Reference.
N
NJCL DD Statement for a Non-VSAM Data Set
N----------------------------------------
NYou can allocate non-VSAM data sets with the access method services
NALLOCATE command. See the DD statements in the examples that follow
Nthe descriptions of the BLDINDEX, EXPORT, IMPORT, REPRO, and PRINT
Ncommands for additional methods of describing and allocating non-VSAM
Ndata sets.
N
NJCL DD Statement for a Snap Dump
N--------------------------------
NIf access method services encounters a condition that requires it to
Nabnormally end a job, it takes a snap dump of virtual storage. You
Nmust write an AMSDUMP DD statement to get the snap dump; that is,
N
I//AMSDUMP DD SYSOUT=*
N
NIf you do not supply an AMSDUMP DD statement and access method services
Nencounters a condition requiring the job to abnormally end, it produces
Nonly an abbreviated dump.
N
NJCL DD Statement for a Target Data Set
N--------------------------------------
NThe usual target data set for listing is SYSPRINT. The default
Nparameters of this data set are:
N
N-> Record format: variable blocked (VBA)
N-> Logical record length: 125, that is, (121+4)
N-> Block size: 0
N
NPrint lines are 121 bytes long. The first byte is the ANSI (American
NNational Standards Institute) control character. The minimum LRECL is
N121 (U-format records only). If a smaller size is used, it is
Noverridden to 121.
N
NYou can alter the defaults by placing other values in the DCB parameter
Nof the SYSPRINT statement. You cannot, however, use a record format of
NF or fixed block (FB); those are changed to VBA.
N
NJCL DD Statement for an Alternate Target Data Set
N-------------------------------------------------
NIn several commands you can use an alternate target data set for
Nlisting, but do not use F or FB record formats.
N
NJCL statements, system messages, and job statistics are written to the
NSYSPRINT output device, not to the alternate target data set.
N
NDirect Allocation Using JCL
N---------------------------
NYou can directly allocate VSAM data sets through JCL.
N
NThe following example allocates a new data set and, with DATACLAS,
Nuses the allocation attributes predetermined by the storage
Nadministrator through the ACS routines.
N
N//DD1       DD DISP=(NEW,CATLG),DSNAME=EXAMPLE1,
N//             DATACLAS=DCLAS01
* End of WISH.
