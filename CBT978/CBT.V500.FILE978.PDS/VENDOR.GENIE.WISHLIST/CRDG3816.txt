N-------
N    Group(groupname): If this is specified alone, it indicates the name
N                      of the group to be deleted. If a resource is also
N                      specified, it indicates the group to which the
N                      resource belongs.
N
N                      Do not use a generic group name.
N
N    List(listname): specifies the name of the list to be deleted.
N
N                    Do not use a generic list name.
N
N    Remove: If this is specified when the group is deleted, the group
N            is removed from all lists that contained it unless UPGRADE
N            commands are running.
N
N    resource-type(resource-name): specifies the name of the resource to
N                                  be deleted. Do not use a generic
N                                  resource name.
