NChapter 10: The Generalized Trace Facility (GTF)
N------------------------------------------------
NGTF trace options
N-----------------
NThis topic describes the GTF options you can specify through either
Nsystem prompting in response to the START GTF command or in a
Npredefined parmlib or data set member.
M
MSee the manual for additional details.
N
D  ASIDP
I    Requests that GTF tracing be limited to a subset of address spaces.
I    ASIDP requests GTF prompting for one to five address space
I    identifiers (ASID) in which you want GTF tracing to occur. ASIDP
I    works only with a GTF option that generates tracing, such as SVC or
I    IO.
N
D  CCW
I    Requests tracing of channel programs and associated data for I/O
I    events. CCW is valid only if the other trace options include SSCH,
I    SSCHP, IO, or IOP.
N
D  CCWP
I    Requests tracing of channel programs and associated data for I/O
I    events, and requests GTF prompting for the following information:
I
I    -> Tracing channel command words (CCW) or device command words (DCW)
I       for start subchannel (SSCH) operations or I/O interruptions or
I       both
I
I    -> Maximum number of CCWs or device command words (DCW) for each
I       event
I
I    -> Maximum number of bytes of data for each CCW or DCW
I
I    -> Optional input/output supervisor block (IOSB), input/output block
I       extension (IOBE, zHPF channel programs only), and error recovery
I       procedure work area (EWA) tracing
I
I    -> Size of the program controlled interrupt (PCI) table
N
D  CSCH
I    Requests recording for all clear subchannel operations.
N
D  DSP
I    Requests recording for all dispatchable units of work: service
I    request block (SRB), local supervisor routine (LSR), task control
I    block (TCB) and Supervisor Call (SVC) prolog dispatch events. If you
I    specify both the SYSM and DSP trace options, GTF records minimal
I    trace data for DSP. Otherwise, GTF records comprehensive trace data
I    for DSP.
N
D  EXT
I    Requests comprehensive recording for all external interruptions.
N
D  HSCH
I    Requests recording for all halt subchannel operations.
N
D  IO
I    Requests recording of all non-program-controlled I/O interruptions.
I    Unless you also specify the PCI trace option, GTF does not record
I    program-controlled interruptions.
N
D  IOX
I    Requests recording of all non-program-controlled I/O interruptions
I    providing a summary of a complete channel program for the I/O
I    interruption in an I/O summary trace record. Unless you also specify
I    the PCI trace option, GTF does not record program-controlled
I    interruptions.
N
D  IOP
I    Requests GTF prompting for specific device numbers for which you
I    want GTF to record non-program-controlled I/O interruptions. Unless
I    you specify the PCI trace option, GTF does not record
I    program-controlled interruptions.
N
D  IOXP
I    Requests GTF prompting for specific device numbers for which you
I    want GTF to record non-program-controlled I/O interruptions
I    providing a summary of a complete channel program for the I/O
I    interruption in an I/O summary trace record. Unless you specify the
I    PCI trace option, GTF does not record program-controlled
I    interruptions.
N
D  JOBNAMEP
I    Requests that GTF tracing be limited to a subset of jobs. JOBNAMEP
I    requests GTF prompting for one through five job names for which you
I    want GTF tracing to occur.
I
I    These job names can be generic, as well as specific, job names. If
I    you want to specify generic job names, use * or % in the job name.
N
D  MSCH
I    Requests recording for all modify subchannel operations.
N
D  PCI
I    Requests recording of intermediate status interruptions in the same
I    format as other I/O trace records that GTF creates.
I
I    Specifically, PCI causes GTF to record program-controlled I/O
I    interruptions, initial status request interruptions, resume
I    subchannel operation instruction, and suspend channel program
I    interruptions. When you select specific devices as a result of
I    prompting for I/O events (IOP trace option), GTF records
I    intermediate status interruptions for only those devices. PCI is
I    valid only when the other trace options include IO, IOP, SYS, SYSM,
I    or SYSP.
N
D  PI
I    Requests comprehensive recording for all program interruptions
I    (0-255).
N
D  PIP
I    Requests GTF prompting for those interruption codes for which you
I    want GTF to record program interruptions.
N
D  RNIO
I    Requests recording of all Virtual Telecommunications Access Method
I    (VTAM) network activity. If you specify both the SYSM and RNIO trace
I    options, GTF will record minimal trace data for RNIO. Otherwise, GTF
I    records comprehensive trace data for RNIO.
N
D  RR
I    Requests comprehensive recording of data associated with all
I    invocations of recovery routines (such as STAE and ESTAE routines).
I    GTF creates a trace record describing the activity of the recovery
I    routine when control passes from the recovery routine back to the
I    recovery termination manager (RTM).
N
D  SLIP
I    Requests that a trace entry be made each time:
I
I    -> A match occurs for a SLIP trap with ACTION=TRACE
I
I    -> A SLIP trap with the SLIP DEBUG option is checked
I
I    The amount of data and the type of SLIP trace record to be built is
I    specified on the SLIP command.
N
D  SRM
I    Requests recording of trace data each time the system resource
I    manager (SRM) is invoked. If you specify both the SYSM and SRM trace
I    options, GTF records minimal trace data for SRM. Otherwise, GTF
I    records comprehensive trace data for SRM.
N
D  SSCH
I    Requests recording for start subchannel and resume subchannel
I    operations.
N
D  SSCHP
I    Requests GTF prompting for the specific device numbers for which you
I    want GTF to record start subchannel and resume subchannel
I    operations.
N
D  SVC
I    Requests comprehensive recording for all SVC interruptions.
N
D  SVCP
I    Requests GTF prompting for those SVC numbers for which you want data
I    recorded.
N
D  SYS
I    Requests recording of comprehensive trace data for all of the
I    following:
I
I    -> Clear subchannel operations
I
I    -> External interruptions
I
I    -> Halt subchannel operations
I
I    -> I/O interruptions
I
I    -> Modify subchannel operations
I
I    -> Program interruptions
I
I    -> Recovery routines
I
I    -> Start subchannel and resume channel operations
I
I    -> SVC interruptions.
I
I    Because specifying SYS automatically causes GTF to trace all of
I    these events, GTF will ignore the following trace options if you
I    specify them in any form:
I
I      CSCH, HSCH, MSCH, SSCH, EXT, IO, PI, RR, SVC.
N
D  SYSM
I    Requests recording of minimal trace data for the same events as SYS.
I
I    Because specifying SYSm automatically causes GTF to trace all of
I    these events, GTF will ignore the following trace options if you
I    specify them in any form:
I
I      CSCH, HSCH, MSCH, SSCH, EXT, IO, PI, RR, SVC.
N
D  SYSP
I    Requests recording for the same events as the SYS option, but causes
I    GTF to prompt for selection of specific SVC, IO, SSCH, and PI events
I    that you want recorded.
I
I    Because specifying SYSm automatically causes GTF to trace all of
I    these events, GTF will ignore the following trace options if you
I    specify them in any form:
I
I      CSCH, HSCH, MSCH, SSCH, EXT, IO, PI, RR, SVC.
N
D  TRC
I    Requests recording of those trace events that are associated with
I    GTF itself. Unless you request TRC, GTF will not trace these events.
I    TRC works only with a GTF option that generates tracing, such as SVC
I    or IO.
N
D  USR
I    Requests recording of all data that the GTRACE macro passes to GTF.
I    You must specify USR or USRP to trace data from the GTRACE macro.
I    Use USRP for specific events. If USR is used instead of USRP, the
I    trace data set might be full of unwanted records. When you code the
I    GTRACE macro but do not specify USR or USRP, GTF ignores the GTRACE
I    macro.
N
D  USRP
I    Requests GTF prompting for specific event identifiers (EID) of the
I    data that the GTRACE macro passes to GTF. The EIDs represent user,
I    program product, or IBM subsystem and component events.
N
D  XSCH
I    Requests recording all cancel subchannel operations.
N
N
NCombining GTF options
N---------------------
NTable 17 shows those TRACE options that GTF will not use in
Ncombination. If two or more options from the same row are specified,
NGTF uses the option that has the lower column number and ignores the
Nother options.
N
NFor example, if you specify both SYSP and PI (see row D), GTF uses
NSYSP (column 2) and ignores PI (column 5).
