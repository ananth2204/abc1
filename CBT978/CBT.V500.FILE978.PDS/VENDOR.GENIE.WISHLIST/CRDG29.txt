NChapter 29. TDQUEUE resources
N-----------------------------
NA TDQUEUE definition defines the attributes of a transient data queue.
NThe following transient data resources can be managed using RDO:
N
N-> Intrapartition
N
N-> Extrapartition
N
N-> Indirect
N
N-> Remote
N
NIntrapartition definitions contain attributes that provide information
Nabout recovery characteristics, trigger levels, associated
Ntransactions, facilities, and userids.
N
NExtrapartition definitions contain information about the associated
NQSAM data set, and the number of buffers that are to be used.
N
NIndirect definitions identify the underlying queue name.
N
NRemote definitions contain the name of the remote system and the name
Nby which the queue is known on that remote system.
N
NBefore a transient data queue can be used by an active CICS system,
Nyou must install its definition in the running system. CICS uses the
Ndefinition to access the data set associated with the queue, and
Nrecords the number of read and write operations on the queue.
