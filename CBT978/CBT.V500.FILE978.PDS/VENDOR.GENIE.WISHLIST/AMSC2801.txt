NSyntax for LISTDATA COUNTS|STATUS|PINNED|DSTATUS|ACCESSCODE Parameters
N----------------------------------------------------------------------
D  LISTDATA /* Abbreviation: LDATA */ -
N
D    COUNTS | /* Abbreviation: CNT */ -
D    STATUS | /* Abbreviation: STAT */ -
D    PINNED | /* Abbreviation: PIN */ -
D    DSTATUS | /* Abbreviation: DSTAT */ -
D    ACCESSCODE /* Abbreviation: ACODE */ -
I      specifies that an operator message with the remote access code is
I      issued or if any of the following reports are printed:
N
I      -> Subsystem counters report
N
I      -> Subsystem status report
N
I      -> Pinned track to data set cross reference report
N
I      -> Device status report
N
I      -> Space efficient volume status report
N
I      -> Extent pool configuration status report
N
I      COUNTS /* Abbreviation: CNT */: specifies that a Subsystem
I        Counters report be printed. This parameter is the default.
N
I        Note: COUNTS can be used with DEVICE, SUBSYSTEM, or ALL.
N
I      STATUS /* Abbreviation: STAT */: specifies that a Subsystem
I        Status report be printed.
N
I        Notes:
N
I        1. STATUS can be issued to an offline device by using the
I           UNITNUMBER parameter.
N
I        2. STATUS can be used with WTO parameters
N
I        3. The data returned on a 3990 IDCAMS LISTDATA STATUS command
I           equals the total cache size. The data returned on a 2105 or
I           2107 control unit only returns the CACHEing information
I           associated with the device. The complete size of CACHE must
I           have 2 device requests done, one for each cluster of the
I           control unit. See APAR OA34771 for more details.
N
I      PINNED /* Abbreviation: PIN */:  specifies that a Pinned Data
I        Status report be printed. The basic syntax is :
N
I        LISTDATA PINNED FILE(XYZ) ALL|SUBSYSTEM|DEVICE
N
I        Notes:
N
I        1. PINNED can be used with DEVICE, SUBSYSTEM, or ALL.
N
I        2. PINNED DEVICE can be issued to an offline device by using
I           the UNITNUMBER parameter.
N
I        3. The LISTDATA PINNED report produced in z/OS V1R10 identifies
I           a range of pinned tracks associated with a data set. In
I           prior releases the report listed each individual track and
I           its associated data set name.
N
I        4. In z/OS V1R10, a 28-bit cylinder address, X'CCCCcccH', is
I           used in the display. The 'ccc' are the high order 12-bits
I           of the cylinder address and 'CCCC' are the low order 16-bits
I           of the cylinder address. The 'H' is the 4-bit track address.
I           The 'F' column in the display with an '*' value will
I           designate when a 28-bit cylinder address is greater than
I           65535 (X'FFFF').
N
I      DSTATUS /* Abbreviation: DSTAT */: specifies that a Device Status
I        report with device identifier, channel connection addresses
I        (CCA), and director-to-device connection (DDC) addresses is
I        printed.
N
I        Notes:
N
I        1. DSTATUS can be used with DEVICE, SUBSYSTEM, or ALL.
N
I        2. DSTATUS does not show offline devices. To show offline
I           devices, use the STATUS and UNITNUMBER parameters.
N
I      ACCESSCODE /* Abbreviation: ACODE */: specifies that the remote
I        access authorization code is sent to the operator's console in
I        message IDC01557I. The WTO message is issued for all storage
I        clusters in the Storage Control.
N
I        Notes:
N
I        1. ACCESSCODE can also be used with the 3990 and 9390 Models
I           1 and 2.
N
I        2. ACCESSCODE can be issued to an offline device by using the
I           UNITNUMBER parameter.
N
I        3. On the operator panel, the storage cluster modem switch must
I           be set to Enable for the storage cluster to which the
I           command is directed. If the modem switch is not set to
I           Enable, the Storage Control does not generate a remote
I           support access code and IDC21558I is issued.
N
I        4. The remote support access code can be used to establish one
I           remote support session within one hour of the time the code
I           is generated. If a remote support session is not established
I           within one hour, the Storage Control invalidates the remote
I           support access code.
N
I        5. RACF* READ access authority to the FACILITY class resource
I           STGADMIN.IDC.LISTDATA.ACCESSCODE is required to use the
I           ACCESSCODE parameter.
N
I        6. The storage cluster modem switch must be in the ENABLE
I           position to generate an access code.
N
NRequired Parameters
N-------------------
D    FILE(ddname) -
I      specifies the name of a DD statement that identifies the device
I      type and volume of a unit within the subsystem. For ddname,
I      substitute the name of the DD statement identifying the device
I      type and volume serial number.
N
D    VOLUME(volser) /* Abbreviation: VOL */ -
I      specifies the volume serial number of a volume within the
I      subsystem. For volser, substitute the volume serial number of
I      the volume.
N
D    UNIT(unittype) -
I      specifies the unit type of the subsystem. This parameter is
I      required only when the VOLUME parameter is specified.
N
D    UNITNUMBER(devid) /* Abbreviation: UNUM */ -
I      specifies the MVS device number. UNITNUMBER can be used with
I      online or offline devices. The UNITNUMBER parameter is only
I      accepted with STATUS, DEVICE PINNED, and ACCESSCODE.
N
I      Note: The UNITNUMBER parameter cannot be used for an online
I      device in the "Intervention Required" state. For
I      SPACEEFFICIENTVOL, the UNITNUMBER parameter cannot be used with
I      SUBSYSTEM or ALL.
N
NOptional Parameters
N-------------------
D    DEVICE | /* Abbreviation: DEV */ -
D    SUBSYSTEM | /* Abbreviation: SSYS or SUBSYS */ -
D    ALL -
I      specifies the scope of the Subsystem Counters report, Pinned
I      Track report, or the Service Status report. One of these
I      parameters is specified when the COUNTS, PINNED, or DSTATUS
I      parameter is specified.
N
I      DEVICE /* Abbreviation: DEV */: specifies that only the addressed
I        device is included in the Subsystem Counters report, Pinned
I        Track report, or the Device Status report.
N
I      SUBSYSTEM /* Abbreviation: SSYS or SUBSYS */: specifies that all
I        devices within the subsystem are included in the Subsystem
I        Counters report, Pinned Track report, or Device Status report.
N
I      ALL: specifies that all devices on all like Storage Control
I        models are included in the Subsystem Counters report, Pinned
I        Track report, or the Device Status report. ALL is the default
I        parameter when the COUNTS, DSTATUS or PINNED parameter is
I        specified.
N
D    LEGEND | /* Abbreviation: LGND */ -
D    NOLEGEND /* Abbreviation: NOLGND */ -
I      specifies whether a legend be printed at the completion of the
I      requested report.
N
I      LEGEND /* Abbreviation: LGND */: specifies that the headings and
I        any abbreviations used in the report are listed. LEGEND can be
I        specified for all printed reports.
N
I      NOLEGEND /* Abbreviation: NOLGND */:  specifies that the headings
I        and any abbreviations used in the report are not listed.
I        NOLEGEND is the default parameter value.
N
D    OUTFILE(ddname) | /* Abbreviation: OFILE */ -
D    OUTDATASET(dsname) /* Abbreviation: ODS or OUTDS */ -
I      OUTFILE /* Abbreviation: OFILE */: specifies the name of a DD
I        statement identifying the data set used to contain the report.
I        For ddname, substitute the name of the DD statement identifying
I        the data set.
N
I      OUTDATASET /* Abbreviation: ODS or OUTDS */: specifies the name
I        of the alternate target data set. For dsname, substitute the
I        name of the data set to be used. The data set name must be
I        cataloged.
N
I        Notes:
N
I        1. Erase the previous alternate target data set before
I           specifying the OUTDATASET parameter. If you do not erase the
I           old data set, your reports can be inaccurate. If a report
I           seems to be in error, compare the time field with the time
I           the job was submitted.
N
I        2. OUTFILE or OUTDATASET can be specified for all printed
I           reports.
N
D    WTO
I      WTO as used with LISTDATA STATUS specifies that information on
I      the overall condition of the subsystem is sent to the system
I      console and a full report is printed. For 3990 or 9390, other
I      status messages can appear on the system console. That is, a
I      message indicating the status of NVS and DASD fast write appears.
I      If the addressed device is one of a duplex pair, a status message
I      on the pair appears.
* End of WISH.
