NJOB Statement
N=============
NCOND Parameter
N--------------
NUse the COND parameter to specify the return code tests the system
Nuses to determine whether a job will continue processing. Before and
Nafter each job step is executed, the system performs the COND
Nparameter tests against the return codes from completed job steps.
NIf none of these tests is satisfied, the system executes the job
Nstep; if any test is satisfied, the system bypasses all remaining
Njob steps and terminates the job.
N
NThe tests are made against return codes from the current execution
Nof the job. A step bypassed because of an EXEC statement COND
Nparameter does not produce a return code.

I                 Specify up to eight return code tests.
I                 code: Specifies a number that the system compares to
I                       the return codes from all previous steps in
I                       the job or from specific steps. code is a
I                       decimal number from 0 through 4095.
I                 operator: Specifies the type of comparison to be made
I                           to the return code. If the specified test
I                           is true, the step is bypassed.

I                           used in the test.
M                        -> LIMITS THE TEST TO A SPECIFIC STEP.
I                        -> If you omit stepname, the code you specify
I                           is compared to the return codes from all
I                           previous steps.

MKenneth Tomiak remark:
M'Programming Using The Kenneth Tomiak Method' (PUTKTM-JCL) strongly
Mencourages you to forsake the use of the COND Parameter for other
Mthan EVEN and ONLY. The code,operator format will have you thinking
Mhow to bypass this step. The IF...THEN/ELSE/ENDIF Statement construct
Mwill have you thinking WHEN to execute this step. And that is how
MEVEN and ONLY function.
N
NCertain error conditions prevent the system from executing a step,
Nregardless of any requests specified through the COND parameter.
N
NExample 1: Plan for success.
N----------------------------
NA properly designed system does not continue if errors occur.
NThus the only example I give is to halt for any non-zero
Nreturn code. I do concede a final step might be worthy of
NABEND=ONLY if it alerts someone to the failure.
N
D//jobname  JOB COND=(0,NE)
I
IThis example is great for showing how to get yourself into trouble.
IIBM programs typically return 0 for success and an increasing
Imultiple of 4 as the severity increases. Thus the above example
Iis coded to skip the step if the previous step worked when what
Iyou more likely wanted was to skip this step if the prior step
Iwas unhappy.
I
IJOB scheduling tools are written with the belief that success
Iis better than failure. Extra handling is required to allow
Ia non-zero return code to continue. Thus trying to run a step
Iwhen the previous step failed is counter-intuitive.
I
IFor what is worth: Job scheduling tools are also not happy with
Ithe IF...THEN/ELSE/ENDIF Statement construct. You may find yourself
Ihaving to remove all uses of COND= and IF...THEN/ELSE/ENDIF
Ibefore promoting TEST JCL to production. For that reason a
I//jobname JOB COND=(0,NE) might be your next best friend.
