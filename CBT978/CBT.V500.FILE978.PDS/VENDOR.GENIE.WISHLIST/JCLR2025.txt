NPASSWORD Parameter
N------------------
NUse the PASSWORD parameter to identify a current RACF password or
Nspecify a new RACF password. You can specify a new password at any
Ntime and must specify a new password when your current one expires.
N
NIf the installation contains the installation exit routine used to
Nverify the password, a new password specified in the PASSWORD parameter
Ntakes effect when the job is read in. The new password takes effect
Neven if the job is held for execution later and may take effect even if
Nthe job fails because of JCL errors. When changing the password, other
Njobs that use the new or old password may fail, depending on when their
Npasswords are verified.
