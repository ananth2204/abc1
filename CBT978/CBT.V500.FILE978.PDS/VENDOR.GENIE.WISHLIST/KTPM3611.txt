NExample 2: Create a Partitioned Data Set from Sequential Input
N--------------------------------------------------------------
NIn this example, a partitioned data set (consisting of three members)
Nis created from sequential input.

NThe control statements are discussed below:
N
N  SYSUT1 DD defines the input data set (INSET). The data set is the
N  first data set on a tape volume.
N
N  SYSUT2 DD defines the output partitioned data set (NEWSET). The data
N  set is to be placed on a disk volume. Ten tracks of primary space,
N  five tracks of secondary space, and five blocks (256 bytes each) of
N  directory space are blocked to reduce the space required by the data
N  set.
N
N  SYSIN DD defines the control data set, which follows in the input
N  stream. The utility control statements are used to create members
N  from sequential input data; the statements do not specify any
N  editing.
N
N  GENERATE indicates that three member names are included in
N  subsequent MEMBER statements and that the IDENT parameter appears
N  twice in subsequent RECORD statements.
N
N  The first MEMBER statement assigns a member name (MEMBER1) to the
N  first member.
N
N  The first RECORD statement (GROUP1) identifies the last record to be
N  placed in the first member. The name of this record (FIRSTMEM)
N  appears in the first eight positions of the input record.
N
N  The remaining MEMBER and RECORD statements define the second and
N  third members. Note that, as there is no RECORD statement associated
N  with the third MEMBER statement, the remainder of the input file
N  will be loaded as the third member.

M  Kenneth asks, 'what is in this INSET data set?
I  And then fabricated some sample data for you with an alternate
I  set of RECORD statements in this wish.
