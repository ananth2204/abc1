NChapter 5. Procedures and Symbols
N---------------------------------
NUsing System Symbols and JCL symbols
N------------------------------------
NSystem symbols and JCL symbols are character strings that represent
Nvariable information in JCL. They allow you to modify JCL statements
Nin a job easily. A symbol-defining string is limited to eight
Ncharacters, not including an identifying & (ampersand) character.
N
NWhat are System Symbols?
N------------------------
NSystem symbols represent values that are unique to each system. A
Nsystem replaces those symbols with its own values when it processes
Nstarted task JCL (jobs and procedures read from a procedure library)
Nand TSO logons. (A started task is a task resulting from JCL that is
Nprocessed immediately as a result of a START command.
N
NWhat are JCL Symbols?
N---------------------
NJCL symbols differ from system symbols in that you must define them in
Nstarted task JCL before you can use them in that JCL. The JCL symbols
Nthat you define are valid only for the current job. Conversely, there
Nis no need to define system symbols; they are either defined to MVS or
Ndefined by your installation, and you can use them in any set of
Nstarted task JCL.
N
NCoding symbols in JCL
N---------------------
NJCL symbols and system symbols can represent parameters,
Nsubparameters, or values in procedures or in the parameter field of
Nstatements; those that vary each time a job runs are good candidates
Nto be coded as symbols.
N
NDetermining equivalent JCL
N--------------------------
NWhen you submit JCL that specifies symbols, the system responds as if
Nyou had coded the equivalent JCL (without symbols) produced by the
Nfollowing sequence of operations:
N
N1. Determine the substitution texts.
N
N2. Substitute all symbols.
N
NExamples of Defining and Coding Symbols in JCL
N----------------------------------------------
NExample 1: Override the coded value.
N------------------------------------
N//jobname  JOB ...
N//         SET OUTCLASS='*'
N//LOCPROC PROC LOC='POK'
N//PS01#01 EXEC PGM=WRITER,ACCT=('&SYSUID.',CBT,JCL,'2017-001')
N//DSA       DD SYSOUT=&OUTCLASS,DEST=&LOC
N//        PEND
N//ST01#01 EXEC PROC=LOCPROC,LOC=NYC
N//
NExample 2: Nullify the &NUMBER JCL symbol.
N------------------------------------------
N//jobname  JOB ...
N//         SET OUTCLASS='*'
N//LOCPROC PROC LOC='POK',NUMBER=3350
N//PS01#01 EXEC PGM=...
N//PIN DD DSNAME=REPORT,DISP=(OLD,KEEP),UNIT=&NUMBER
N//POUT DD SYSOUT=A,DEST=&LOC
N//        PEND
N//ST01#01 EXEC PROC=LOCPROC,NUMBER=,LOC=NYC
