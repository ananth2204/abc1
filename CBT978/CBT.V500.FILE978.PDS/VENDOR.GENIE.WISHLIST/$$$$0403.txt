NChapter 4. Installing new TOPICs, CHAPTERs, and WISHes
N------------------------------------------------------
NBuilding your own WISH member
N-----------------------------
NThe member hierarchy
N--------------------
NEvery WISH member should be accompanied by a TOPIC and CHAPTER member.
NThe four character TOPIC member is the starting point of what GENIE
Nwill show on the GENIE Member Selector panel. Most of the delivered
NTOPICs correspond to a manual. RXCP is based on a presentation and
NKTPM is the TOPIC containing a bunch of CHAPTERs donated to FILE972
Ndonated by Kenneth Tomiak showing his Programming Method with some
Nreal world examples.
N
NA TOPIC is then divided into six character CHAPTER members. This
Nfollows the way the manuals are organized. A CHAPTER is divided
Ninto the eight character WISH members. Some manuals are laid out that
Nmakes it easy to number WISH members. Some require creative thinking.
N
NRecord lengths
N--------------
NThe WISHLIST pds is defined with LRECL=81 to allow for a record
Nidentifier (ID@TYPE shown below) and up to 80 characters on a
NDATALINE. An INFOLINE is also capable of using up to 80 characters.
NIt is an ISPF restriction that MSGLINE and NOTELINE are limited to
N72 characters. I learned this after I gad created 1,359 WISHLIST
Nmembers and spent a few hours splitting lines that were too long or
Nchanging their ID@TYPE.
N
NSpecial handling of text INFOLINE
N---------------------------------
NI spent hours disgnosing why an insert was failing and discovered
Na NOTELINE can not insert 'INFOLINE' as the only data on a line. I
Nadded logic to GENIE to add a space if you should run into this
Ncondition. This member may be the only cause where it gets done.
N
NRecord layouts
N--------------
NI started out simple, using an ID@TYPE followed by the data
Nassociated with it. For the most part, an ID@TYPE contains
Ndata in a free format. I do have my own style and conventions
Nyou may want to follow. Some are optional. The bulk of a
NWISHLIST member that adds value are the D, I, M, and N ID@TYPEs.
NThe two required ID@TYPEs are S and T.
N
NWISH member format
N------------------
NI chose to step down to the WISH description by coding the
NTOPIC, dashed, the CHAPTER, dashed, and any sub-headings,
Nalso dashed, that brings the inserted NOTELINEs to the
NWISH content. Some WISHLIST members will only contain NOTELINEs,
Nwhile the useful WISH members will be populated with DATALINEs
Ninserted as real records in the PDS member and accompanying
NINFOLINEs that describe the DATALINE and how to tailor it.
NOther useful WISH members will have sample code as DATALINES
Nor Examples as INFOLINEs. The enduser can convert any of the
Nnon-DATALINEs using the MD line command. As part of that being
Ncreative in naming WISH comes further dividing a WISH member
Nwith sub-headings, dashed.
N
NID@TYPEs define what a record is used for
