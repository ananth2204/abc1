NChapter 15. JOURNALMODEL resources
N----------------------------------
NA JOURNALMODEL resource defines the connection between a CICS journal
Nname (or identifier) and the associated physical log streams managed by
Nthe MVS system logger, or between the journal name and the SMF log.
N
NAlthough they are intended mainly for user journals, you can also
Ndefine journal models for the system log and forward recovery logs
N(non-RLS only). However, for forward recovery logs, you are recommended
Nto define all log stream names for forward recovery in the VSAM
Ncatalog. This is mandatory for VSAM files processed in RLS mode, but
Noptional for non-RLS mode files.
N
NUnlike the journal control table, you do not need to define a journal
Nmodel for every journal that CICS uses. Instead, define some generic
Nmodel definitions that describe the mapping to log stream names for the
Nmajority of your CICS journals.
N
NYou may find that you can use the default models supplied by CICS and
Nneed not define any of your own. In addition to generic models, you can
Ndefine the necessary specific models where special handling is required
N(for example, SMF logging, or merging with other log streams).
N
NYou can change JOURNALMODEL definitions at any time, but any journal
Nentries that CICS has already created using model definition cannot
Nreflect the change unless you first delete the existing entry using a
NDISCARD JOURNALNAME() command.
