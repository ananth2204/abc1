NExample 9: Unload Selected Members, Load, Copy and Merge
N--------------------------------------------------------
NIn this example, members are selected, excluded, unloaded, loaded, and
Ncopied. Processing will occur as follows:
N
N  1. unload, excluding members
N  2. unload, selecting members
N  3. load and copy to merge members

NThe control statements are discussed below:
N
N  PDS1 DD defines a partitioned data set called ACCOUNTA that contains
N  six members (A, B, C, D, E, and F).
N
N  PDS2 DD defines a partitioned data set called ACCOUNTB that contains
N  three members (A, K, and L).
N
N  SEQ1 DD defines a new sequential data set called SAVAC.
N
N  SEQ2 DD defines a new sequential data set called SAVACB on a tape
N  volume. The tape has IBM standard labels.
N
N  NEWUP DD defines an old sequential data set called NEWACC that is
N  the unloaded form of a partitioned data set that contains eight
N  members (A, B, C, D, M, N, O, and P). It resides on a tape volume.
N
N  MERGE DD defines a partitioned data set called ACCUPDAT that
N  contains six members (A, B, C, D, Q, and R).
N
N  SYSUT3 and SYSUT4 DD define temporary spill data sets.
N
N  SYSIN DD defines the control data set, which follows in the input
N  stream.
N
N  The first COPY statement indicates the start of the first copy
N  operation. The OUTDD parameter specifies that SAVAC is the output
N  data set, and the INNDD parameter specifies that ACCOUNTA is the
N  input data set. Because SAVAC is a sequential data set, ACCOUNTA
N  will be unloaded in this copy operation.
N
N  The EXCLUDE statement specifies that members D and C are not to be
N  unloaded to SAVAC with the rest of ACCOUNTA.
N
N  The second COPY statement indicates the start of the second copy
N  operation.
N
N  The OUTDD parameter specifies that SAVACB is the output data set,
N  and the INDD parameter specifies that ACCOUNTB is the input data
N  set. Because SAVACB is a sequential data set, ACCOUNTB will be
N  unloaded in this copy operation.
N
N  The SELECT statement specifies that members A and K are the only
N  members of ACCOUNTB that are to be unloaded to SAVACB.
N
N  The third COPY statement indicates the start of the last copy
N  operation. The OUTDD parameter specifies that ACCUPDAT is the output
N  data set. The EXCLUDE statement specifies that member A is excluded
N  from this copy operation. The three data sets specified in the INDD
N  parameter will be processed as follows:
M
M  1. The data set NEWACC is a sequential data set, so it is loaded into
M     ACCUPDAT. Because the replace option is specified, members B, C,
M     and D in NEWACC replace identically named members in ACCUPDAT. The
M     remaining members of NEWACC are also copied to ACCUPDAT, except
M     for A, which is excluded from the copy operation.
M
M  2. The data set ACCOUNTA is a partitioned data set, so its members
M     are copied to ACCUPDAT. Because replacement is not specified, only
M     members E and F are copied.
M
M  3. The data set ACCOUNTB is a partitioned data set, so its members
M     are copied to ACCUPDAT. Only members K and L are copied.
M
* End of WISH.
