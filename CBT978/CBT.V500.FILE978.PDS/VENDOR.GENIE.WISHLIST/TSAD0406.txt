NChapter 4: Stand-Alone dump
N---------------------------
NMessage output
N--------------
NThere are three types of message output from a stand-alone dump
Nprogram, as follows:
N
N-> MNOTES from the AMDSADMP macro
N
N-> Messages on the 3480, 3490, or 3590 display
N
N-> Messages on the system console or the operator console
N
N
NMNOTES from the AMDSADMP macro
N------------------------------
MThese were produced when you created the stand-alone (IPLable)
Mprogram as shown in TSAD0403: Chapter 4: Stand-Alone dump -Generating
Mthe stand-alone dump program.
N
N
NStand-alone dump messages on the 3480, 3490, or 3590 display
N------------------------------------------------------------
NWhen stand-alone dump output is sent to a 3480, 3490, or 3590 magnetic
Ntape subsystem, stand-alone dump uses the subsystem's eight-character
Nmessage display to inform and prompt the operator. The leftmost
Nposition on the message display indicates a requested operator action.
NThe eighth position (rightmost) gives additional information.
N
NThe stand-alone dump messages that can appear on the display are:
N-----------------------------------------------------------------
N
NDvolser (alternating)
N
NMSADMP#U Informs the operator that a labeled tape has been rejected
N         and a new tape must be mounted.
N
NMSADMP#U (blinking) Requests that the operator mount a new tape.
N
NRSADMP#U (blinking) Indicates that the stand-alone dump program has
N         finished writing to the tape.
N
NRSADMP# (alternating)
N
NMSADMP#U Informs the operator that an end-of-reel condition has
N         occurred and a new tape must be mounted.
N
NSADMP# (blinking) Indicates that the tape is in use by
Nstand-alone dump.
N
NSADMP# (alternating)
N
NNTRDY Informs the operator that some type of intervention is required.
N
NThe symbols used in the messages are:
N-------------------------------------
N# A variable indicating the actual number of cartridges mounted for
N  stand-alone dump. It is a decimal digit starting at 1 and increasing
N  by 1 after each end-of-cartridge condition. When the # value exceeds
N  9, it is reset to 0.
N
ND Demount the tape and retain it for further system use, for example
N  as a scratch tape. Stand-alone dump does not write on the tape.
N
NM Mount a new tape.
N
NR Demount the tape and retain it for future stand-alone dump use.
N
NU The new tape should not be file-protected.
N
Nvolser A variable indicating the volume serial number on the existing
N       tape label.
