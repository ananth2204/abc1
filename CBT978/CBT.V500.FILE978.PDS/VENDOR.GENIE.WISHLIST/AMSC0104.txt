N-----------------------------------
NChapter 1. Using Access Method Services
N---------------------------------------
NOrder of Catalog Use
N--------------------
NTo select the catalog to be searched or chosen for an entry, use
Nthe CATALOG parameter. You can use the CATALOG parameter with several
Ncommands such as ALTER, BLDINDEX, DEFINE, DELETE, EXPORT, and LISTCAT.
NIf you use an alias name, the catalog associated with the name is
Nsearched or selected.
N
NThe multilevel alias facility enhances catalog selection that is based
Non high-level qualifiers of the data set name. It employs a right to
Nleft search of the multiple levels of qualifiers of the data set name
Nfor a matching alias name or user catalog name. The alias name or
Nuser catalog name with the greatest number of matching qualifiers is
Nselected. For additional information on the multilevel alias facility,
Nsee z/OS DFSMS Managing Catalogs.
N
NThroughout the following "catalog search" and "catalog selection"
Nsections, the catalog name cannot be specified for SMS-managed
Ndata sets unless you have authority from the
NRACF STGADMIN.IGG.DIRCAT FACILITY class. With this authorization,
Na data set can be directed to a specific catalog. For more information
Nabout this FACILITY class, see z/OS DFSMSdfp Storage Administration.
N
NCatalog Search Order for ALTER
N------------------------------
N1. If a catalog is given in the CATALOG parameter, only that catalog
N   is searched. If the entry is not found, a no-entry-found error is
N   returned.
N
N2. If the entry is identified with a qualified entry name, and it is
N   not generic, and its qualifiers are the same as the name or the
N   alias of a catalog, or if the entry is found, no other catalog is
N   searched.
N
N3. The master catalog is searched. If the entry is not found in any
N   of the indicated catalogs, a no-entry-found error is returned.
N
NCatalog Selection Order for BLDINDEX
N------------------------------------
NThis section applies only to users of BLDINDEX who code NOSORTCALL.
N
N1. If a catalog is specified with the CATALOG parameter, that catalog
N   is selected to contain work file entries.
N
N2. If the entry (data set name on the DD statement) is identified with
N   a qualified entry name, and:
N
N   -> One or more of its qualifiers is the same as the name or the
N      alias of a catalog,
N
N   or
N
N   -> The first qualifier is the same as the name or the alias of a
N      VSAM user catalog
N
N   then the user catalog so identified is selected to contain the
N   work file entries.
N
N3. The master catalog is selected to contain the work file entries.
N
NCatalog Selection Order for DEFINE
N----------------------------------
N1. If a catalog is defined in the CATALOG parameter, that catalog is
N   selected to contain the to-be-defined entry.
N
N2. When a non-VSAM generation data group (GDG) data set is defined,
N   the catalog containing the GDG base is selected to contain the
N   to-be-defined non-VSAM entry.
N
N3. If no user catalog is specified for the current job step or job,
N   the entry's name is a qualified name, and:
N
N   -> One or more of its qualifiers is the same as the name or the
N      alias of a catalog,
N
N   or
N
N   -> The first qualifier is the same as the name or the alias of a
N      VSAM user catalog,
N
N   then the catalog so identified is selected to contain the
N   to-be-defined entry.
N
N4. If no catalog has been identified, either explicitly or implicitly,
N   VSAM defines an object in the master catalog.
N
NCatalog Search Order for DELETE
N-------------------------------
NIf this is not a generic delete, the order in which catalogs are
Nsearched to locate an entry to be deleted is:
N
N1. If a catalog is given in the CATALOG parameter, only that catalog
N   is searched. If the entry is not found, a no-entry-found error is
N   returned.
N
N2. If the entry is identified with a qualified entry name, and:
N
N   -> One or more of its qualifiers is the same as the name or the
N      alias of a catalog, If the entry is found, no other catalog is
N      searched.
N
N3. If the entry is not found, the master catalog is searched. If the
N   entry is not found in the master catalog, a no-entry-found error
N   is returned.
N
NIf this is a generic delete, the order in which catalogs are searched
Nto locate all applicable entries to be deleted is:
N
N1. If a catalog is given in the CATALOG parameter, only that catalog
N   is searched. If an entry that matches the supplied qualifiers is
N   not found, a no-entry-found error is returned.
N
N2. If the entry is identified with a qualified entry name and if one
N   of the following situations occur, then the catalog search continues
N   with step 4:
N
N   -> One or more of its qualifiers is the same as the name of a
N      catalog
N
N   -> One or more of its qualifiers is the same as the alias of a
N      catalog
N
N   -> The first qualifier is the same as the name of a VSAM user
N      catalog
N
N3. The master catalog is searched.
N
N4. If an entry matching the supplied qualifiers is not found in any
N   of the catalogs searched, a no-entry-found error is returned.
N
NIf this is a mask delete, which is having the MASK keyword specified
Nin the DELETE command, the order in which catalogs are searched to
Nlocate all applicable entries to be deleted is:
N
N1. If a catalog is given in the CATALOG parameter, only that given
N   catalog is searched. If there are no entries matching the supplied
N   mask filter entry in that catalog, a no-entry-found error is
N   returned.
N
N2. If no catalog is given in the CATALOG parameter, only the master
N   catalog is search. No other catalogs are searched. If there are no
N   entries matching the supplied mask filter entry in the master
N   catalog. A no-entry-found error is returned.
N
NCaution: Unwanted deletions can take place if the catalog is not
Nspecified with the CATALOG parameter. Other catalogs are searched,
Naccording to the order previously described, and any entries matching
Nthe supplied qualifiers are deleted.
N
NFor information about generic catalog selection for the DELETE
Ncommand, see "Generic Catalog Selection for DELETE and LISTCAT".
N
NCatalog Selection Order for EXPORT DISCONNECT
N---------------------------------------------
N1. If a catalog is specified with the CATALOG subparameter, that
N   catalog is selected. If the data set is not found in that catalog,
N   the command will be unsuccessful.
N
N2. If the entry is identified with a qualified entry name and one of
N   the following situations occur, then the catalog search will
N   continue with step 3:
N
N   -> One or more of its qualifiers is the same as the name or the
N      alias of a catalog
N
N   -> The first qualifier is the same as the name or the alias of a
N      VSAM user catalog
N
N   -> The user catalog so identified is searched.
N
N3. Then the master catalog is searched. If the entry is not found in
N   the master catalog, a no-entry-found error is returned.
N
NCatalog Search Order for LISTCAT
N--------------------------------
NWhen you do not use the ENTRIES parameter, or the command is not run
Nthrough TSO/E and it is not a generic LISTCAT, the order in which
Ncatalogs are searched when entries are to be listed using the
NLISTCAT command is:
N
N1. If a catalog is specified in the CATALOG parameter, only that
N   catalog is listed.
N
N2. If no user catalog is named in the current job step or job, the
N   master catalog is listed.
N
NIf the command is not a generic LISTCAT and the ENTRIES or LEVEL
Nparameter is used, or when the command is run through TSO/E, the
Norder in which catalogs are searched when entries are to be listed
Nusing the LISTCAT command is:
N
N1. If a catalog is in the CATALOG parameter, only that catalog is
N   searched. If the entry is not found, a no-entry-found error is
N   returned.
N
N2. If the entry is not found, the entry's name is a qualified name,
N   and:
N
N   -> One or more of its qualifiers is the same as the name or the
N      alias of a catalog that user catalog is searched. If the entry
I      is found, no other catalog is searched.
N
N3. The master catalog is searched. If the entry is not found, a
N   no-entry-found error is returned.
N
NWhen the ENTRIES parameter is used and this is a generic LISTCAT, the
Norder in which catalogs are searched when entries are to be listed
Nusing the LISTCAT command is:
N
N1. If a catalog is shown in the CATALOG parameter, only that catalog
N   is searched. If an entry is not found that matches the supplied
N   qualifiers, a no-entry-found error is returned.
N
N2. If the entry's name is a qualified name, and:
N
N   -> One or more of its qualifiers is the same as the name or the
N      alias of a catalog is searched. The catalog search continues
N      with step 4.
N
N3. The master catalog is searched. If an entry has not been found in
N   any of the catalogs searched that matched the supplied qualifiers,
N   a no-entry-found error is returned.
N
NGeneric Catalog Selection for DELETE and LISTCAT
N------------------------------------------------
NThe multilevel alias facility enhances generic catalog selection. If
Nyou use generic catalog selection with multilevel aliases, you can
Nselect several catalogs if the number of qualification levels of the
Ngeneric name is less than the maximum your system allows. See
Nz/OS DFSMS Managing Catalogs for information about setting multilevel
Nalias levels in the catalog address space. If the number of
Nqualification levels in the data set name is less than the maximum
Nyour system allows, and aliases exist that match the generic data set
Nname, then every catalog related to those aliases (including the
Nmaster catalog) is selected.
N
NThe multilevel alias facility and the system-generated name format
Nrequire special attention, such as:
N
N -> During the DEFINE of a VSAM data set, if the specified data/index
N    name does not point to the same catalog as the cluster, an error
N    occurs.
N
N -> During the DEFINE of a VSAM cluster or a GDG, if the name of the
N    cluster or GDG matches an existing alias or user catalog, the
N    DEFINE request is denied with a duplicate-name error. This is to
N    prevent the data/index component or a GDS from becoming
N    inaccessible.
N
N -> When you add an alias to the catalog, make sure that it does not
N    cause existing data sets to become inaccessible.
N
NWith the multilevel alias facility, a non-VSAM data set with the same
Nhigh-level qualifier as an existing alias of a user catalog can be
Ndefined. For more details, see z/OS DFSMS Managing Catalogs.
N
NThe selection order is based upon alias names encountered that match
Nthe generic data set name, not upon the catalogs or the data set
Nnames selected. For LISTCAT, therefore, entries appear in the
Ndata set within alias entry order.
N
NShould two or more aliases relate to the same catalog, only the first
Ncatalog reference is used.
N
NIf no catalogs are found in the prior searches, the master catalog is
Nsearched.
