NExample 8: Edit Double-Byte Character Set Data
N----------------------------------------------
NIn this example, an edited data set containing double-byte character
Nset data is created. Shift-out/shift-in characters (< and >) are
Ninserted to enclose the DBCS strings.

NThe control statements are discussed below.
N
N  SYSUT1 DD defines the input data set, INPUT, which resides on a disk
N  volume.
N
N  SYSUT2 DD defines the output data set, OUTPUT, which will reside on
N  a disk volume.
N
N  SYSIN DD defines the control data set, which follows in the input
N  stream.
N
N  GENERATE indicates that a maximum of four FIELD parameters and nine
N  literal characters will appear on subsequent RECORD statements, and
N  that the input data set contains DBCS data.
N
N  RECORD specifies how input records will be edited before being
N  placed in the output data set. The first FIELD parameter indicates
N  that the first 20 positions (bytes) of the input records are to be
N  placed in the first 20 positions of the output records.
N
N  The second FIELD parameter indicates that data in positions 33
N  through 48 are to be checked to ensure that they are valid DBCS
N  data, and that shift-out/shift-in characters are to be inserted
N  around this field. For DBCS data to be valid, each byte of the
N  2-byte characters must have a hexadecimal value between X'41' and
N  X'FE', or the 2-byte character must be a DBCS space (X'4040'). Once
N  the checking and inserting are completed, this field is to be copied
N  to the output records beginning at position 21.
N
N  The third FIELD parameter operates on the 30-byte field beginning at
N  position 50 in the input records. This field is checked for valid
N  DBCS data, and shift-out/shift-in characters are inserted around the
N  field. The resulting field is copied to the output records beginning
N  at position 39.
I
INotice that in specifying the output locations in the FIELD parameter,
Iyou have to account for the additional positions that the SO/SI
Icharacters will use. For instance, the eight-character (16-byte) DBCS
Istring beginning at position 21 does not end at position 36, but at 38.
IThe SO/SI characters are single-byte characters, so the pair will take
Iup two positions.
I
IThe final FIELD parameter clears out the final positions of the output
Irecords with asterisks.
