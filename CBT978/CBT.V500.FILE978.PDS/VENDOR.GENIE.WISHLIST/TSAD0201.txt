NChapter 2: SVC dump
N-------------------
NPlanning data set management for SVC dumps
N------------------------------------------
N
NSetting up allocation authority
N-------------------------------
NTo allocate dump data sets automatically, the DUMPSRV address space
Nmust have authority to allocate new data sets. Do the following:
N1. Associate the DUMPSRV address space with a user ID. Use the RACF.
N   STARTED general resource class or the RACF Started Procedures Table,
N   ICHRIN03, to associate DUMPSRV with a user id.
N
N2. Authorize DUMPSRV's user ID to create new dump data sets using the
N   naming convention in the following topic. With the high-level
N   qualifier of SYS1, the data sets are considered group data sets.
N   You can assign CREATE group authority to the DUMPSRV user ID within
N   that group.
N
NConfiguration
N-------------
NTo verify dump status issue the DISPLAY DUMP,STATUS command.
DD DUMP,STATUS
NTo see DUMP options issue the DISPLAY DUMP,OPTIONS command.
DDISPLAY DUMP,OPTIONS
N
NEstablishing a name pattern
N---------------------------
IA set of symbols is available so that you can include the following
Ikinds of information in the names of your automatically allocated
Idump data sets:
I
I-> System name
I-> Sysplex name
I-> Job name
I-> Local and GMT time and date
I-> Sequence number
N
NUse the DISPLAY SYMBOLS command to display the current static system
Nsymbols and their associated substitution texts.
DD SYMBOLS
M
MMessage from Kenneth Tomiak:
MNowhere did I find the date and time symbols documented.
M
NBy default, the system uses one of three name patterns. The system
Ntypically uses the normal pattern
N
N1. SYS1.DUMP.D&DATE..T&TIME..&SYSNAME..S&SEQ
I   &SYSNAME. does not start with a numeric.
N2. SYS1.DUMP.D&YYMMDD..T&HHMMSS..S&SYSNAME..S&SEQ
I   &SYSNAME. starts with a numeric AND is less than 8 characters.
N3. SYS1.DUMP.D&YYMMDD..T&HHMMSS..S&SYSNAME(2&colon.8)..S&SEQ
I   &SYSNAME. starts with a numeric AND is 8 characters.
I   Note: In a SYSPLEX this could resolve to the same name if
I         you only vary the last character.
N
NSet up your installation data set name pattern using the
NDUMPDS command.
NSample:
DDUMPDS NAME=SYS1.DUMP.&SYSNAME..&JOBNAME..Y&YR4.M&MON..D&DAY.T&HR.&MIN..S&SEQ.
N
NDefining resources for dump data sets
N-------------------------------------
NWhen automatic allocation is inactive, dumps are written to
Npre-allocated
NSYS1.DUMPxx data sets if they exist.
N
NYou can define dump data set resources using
N-> DUMPDS ADD,VOL=volser (for DASD volumes)
N-> DUMPDS ADD,SMS=class (for SMS classes)
DDUMPDS ADD,VOL=(SCRTH1,HSM111)
DDUMPDS ADD,SMS=(DUMPDA)
N
NActivating automatic allocation
N-------------------------------
NBy default, automatic allocation is inactive after IPLing the system.
Nadd to your COMMNDxx parmlib member the
N-> DUMPDS NAME= command,
N-> DUMPDS ADD commands,
N-> DUMPDS ALLOC=ACTIVE command
N
NAllocating SYS1.DUMPxx data sets
N--------------------------------
NSPACE: An installation must consider the size of the page data set that
Nwill contain the dump data. The data set must be large enough to hold
Nthe amount of data as defined by the MAXSPACE parameter on the CHNGDUMP
Ncommand, VIO pages, and pageable private area pages.
IThe maximum size of a data set is 65,535 tracks. For a 3390 this is
I4,369 cylinders, and will hold about 2.8 gigabytes of data
N
NCLEAR a SYS1.DUMP data set
N--------------------------
NThe system writes only one dump in each SYS1.DUMPxx data set.
NBefore the data set can be used for another dump, clear it using
Nthe DUMPDS command with the CLEAR keyword.
N
DDD CLEAR,DSN=nn
N
NChoosing SVC dump data sets
N---------------------------
NIBM recommends using extended format sequential data sets as dump data
Nsets for SVC Dumps.
DDSNTYPE=LARGE
N
NFinding automatically allocated dump data sets
N----------------------------------------------
DDISPLAY DUMP,TITLE,AUTODSN=5
