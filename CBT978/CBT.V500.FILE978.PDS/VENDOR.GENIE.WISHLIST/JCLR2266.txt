NOUTPUT JCL Statement
N====================
NPRTERROR Parameter
N------------------
NSpecifies the disposition of the SYSOUT data set used if a terminating
Nerror occurs during printing through the PSF functional subsystem.
N(A terminating error is an error that the automated recovery of PSF
Ncannot correct.) You can specify which of the following actions PSF
Nis to take for a terminating error:
N
N->Use the default error disposition (DEFAULT),
N->Release the SYSOUT data set back to JES as complete (QUIT), or
N->Hold for operator action (HOLD).
N
D//outds OUTPUT PRTERROR={DEFAULT | QUIT | HOLD}
I                 DEFAULT: Specifies that PSF will take the standard
I                   (default) action if a terminating error occurs
I                   during printing. When operator action is expected
I                   to correct the error, PSF releases the SYSOUT data
I                   set for hold. Otherwise, it treats the SYSOUT data
I                   as complete. For JES2, processing of the data set
I                   proceeds according to the OUTDISP keyword value
I                   that is associated with it. For JES3, the data set
I                   is deleted from the SPOOL.
I
I                 QUIT: Specifies that PSF is to release the data set
I                   complete even if a terminating error occurs during
I                   printing. JES then disposes of the data set as if
I                   it completed printing successfully. For JES2,
I                   processing of the data set proceeds according to
I                   the OUTDISP keyword value that is associated with
I                   it. For JES3, the data set is deleted from the
I                   SPOOL.
I
I                 HOLD: Specifies that if a terminating error occurs
I                   during printing, the data set will remain on the
I                   JES SPOOL until the system operator releases it.
