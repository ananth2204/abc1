NSyntax for LISTCAT Parameters
N-----------------------------
D  LISTCAT /* Abbreviation: LISTC */ -
N
NRequired Parameters
N-------------------
N    The LISTCAT command has no required parameters.
N
N    When the LISTCAT command is entered as a job step (that is, not
N    through TSO/E) and no parameters are specified, an entire catalog
N    is listed. Search "Catalog Search Order for LISTCAT" for a
N    description of how the catalog to be listed is selected.
N
N    For TSO/E users, when LISTCAT is invoked from a TSO/E terminal and
N    no operands are specified, the prefix (the TSO/E userid) becomes
N    the highest level of entryname qualification and only those entries
N    with a matching highest level of qualification are listed. It is
N    as though you specified:
N
N      LISTCAT LEVEL(TSO/E user prefix)
N
NOptional Parameters
N-------------------
D    ALIAS | -
D    ALTERNATEINDEX | /* Abbreviation: AIX */ -
D    CLUSTER | /* Abbreviation: CL */ -
D    DATA | -
D    GENERATIONDATAGROUP | /* Abbreviation: GDG */ -
D    INDEX | /* Abbreviation: IX */ -
D    LIBRARYENTRY | /* Abbreviation: LIBENTRY | LIBENT */ -
D    NONVSAM | /* Abbreviation: NVSAM */ -
D    PAGESPACE | /* Abbreviation: PGSPC */ -
D    PATH | -
D    USERCATALOG | /* Abbreviation: UCAT */ -
D    VOLUMEENTRY | /* Abbreviation: VOLENTRY | VOLENT */ -
I      specifies that certain types of entries are to be listed. Only
I      those entries whose type is specified are listed. For example, if
I      you specify CLUSTER but not DATA or INDEX, the cluster's entry is
I      listed and its associated data and index entries are not listed.
N
I      If you use ENTRIES and also specify an entry type, the entryname
I      is not listed unless it is of the specified type. You can specify
I      as many entry types as desired. When you want to completely list
I      a catalog, do not specify any entry type.
N
I      ALIAS: specifies that alias entries are to be listed.
N
I      ALTERNATEINDEX /* Abbreviation: AIX */: specifies that entries
I        for alternate indexes are to be listed. If ALTERNATEINDEX is
I        specified and DATA and INDEX are not also specified, entries
I        for the alternate index's data and index components are not
I        listed.
N
I      CLUSTER /* Abbreviation: CL */: specifies that cluster entries
I        are to be listed. If CLUSTER is specified and DATA and INDEX
I        are not also specified, entries for the cluster's data and
I        index components are not listed.
N
I      DATA: specifies that entries for data components of clusters and
I        alternate indexes are to be listed.
N
I        If a VSAM object's name is specified and DATA is coded, only
I        the object's data component entry is listed. When DATA is the
I        only entry type parameter coded, the catalog's data component
I        is not listed.
N
I      GENERATIONDATAGROUP /* Abbreviation: GDG */: specifies that
I        entries for generation data groups are to be listed. GDSs in
I        the active state, existing at the time the LISTCAT command is
I        entered, are identified as such when ALL is specified.
N
I      INDEX: Abbreviation: IX */: specifies that entries for index
I        components of key-sequenced clusters and alternate indexes are
I        to be listed. If a VSAM object's name is specified and INDEX
I        is coded, only the object's index component entry is listed.
I        When INDEX is the only entry type parameter coded, the
I        catalog's index component is not listed.
N
I      LIBRARYENTRY /* Abbreviation: LIBENTRY | LIBENT */: specifies
I        that tape library entries are to be listed.
N
I        libent: specifies the name of the tape library entry.
N
I      NONVSAM: /* Abbreviation: NVSAM */: specifies that entries for
I        non-VSAM data sets are to be listed. If a generation data
I        group's name and non-VSAM are specified, GDSs in the deferred,
I        active, or rolled-off state, associated with the GDG are listed
I        by specifying the ALL option.
N
I      PAGESPACE /* Abbreviation: PGSPC */: specifies that entries for
I        page spaces are to be listed.
N
I      PATH: specifies that entries for paths are to be listed.
N
I      USERCATALOG /* Abbreviation: UCAT */: specifies that catalog
I        connectors are to be listed. The user catalog connector entries
I        are in the master catalog. (User catalog connector entries can
I        also be in a user catalog, but the operating system does not
I        recognize them when searching for a user catalog.)
N
I      VOLUMEENTRY /* Abbreviation: VOLENTRY | VOLENT */: specifies that
I        tape library volume entries are to be listed. Prefix the name
I        of the tape volume with the letter 'V'. For example 'Vxxxxx',
I        where xxxxx equals the volume name. You can specify the
I        CATALOG parameter to list tape volume entries from a specific
I        catalog.
N
I        volent: specifies the name of the tape volume entry to be
I          listed.
N
D    CREATION(days) /* Abbreviation: CREAT */ -
I      specifies that entries of the indicated type (CLUSTER, DATA, and
I      so on,) are to be listed only if they were created the specified
I      number of days ago or earlier.
N
I      days: specifies the number of days ago. The maximum number that
I        can be specified is 9999; zero indicates that all entries are
I        to be listed.
N
D    ENTRIES(entryname ...) | /* Abbreviation: ENT */ -
D    LEVEL(level) /* Abbreviation: LVL */ -
D      NOCDILVL | CDILVL -
I      ENTRIES: specifies the names of entries to be listed.
N
I      Unexpired GDSs that have been rolled off and recataloged can be
I      displayed using LISTCAT ENTRIES(gdg.*), LISTCAT LEVEL(gdg) where
I      gdg is the original name of the GDG, LISTCAT HISTORY, and
I      LISTCAT ALL. Current and deferred generations are displayed as
I      well as those that have been rolled off, in alphabetical order.
N
I      For TSO/E users, TSO/E will prefix the user ID to the specified
I      data set name when the ENTRIES parameter is unqualified. The
I      userid is not prefixed when the LEVEL parameter is specified.
N
I      Exception: You can use LISTCAT ENTRY LEVEL command only to list
I      the cluster information of the entry. To list the data component
I      information for the entry, you must use the LISTCAT ENTRY ALL
I      command.
N
I      ENTRIES(entryname ...) /* Abbreviation: ENT */: specifies the
I        name or generic name of each entry to be listed. (See the
I        generic examples following the description of the LEVEL
I        parameter.) When you want to list the entries that describe a
I        user catalog, the catalog's volume must be physically mounted.
I        You then specify the catalog's name as the entryname.
N
I      LEVEL(level) /* Abbreviation: LVL */: specifies that all entries
I        that match the level of qualification specified by (level) are
I        to be listed irrespective of the number of additional
I        qualifiers.
N
I        If you specify a generic level name, only one qualifier
I        replaces the *. The * must not be the last character specified
I        in the LEVEL parameter. LEVEL(A.*) will give you an error
I        message.
N
I        When you are using a generic name with the LEVEL parameter you
I        can use a '%' . The'%'acts as a place holder for a single
I        character. For example, you can specify the following:
N
I          LISTCAT LVL(DMP.S7P2.D%%%%%%.T%%%%%%.YDMJBA00)
N
I        LEVEL can result in more than one user catalog being searched
I        if the multilevel alias search level is greater than 1. For
I        example if TEST is an alias for UCAT.ONE and TEST.PROD is an
I        alias for UCAT.TWO, and the multilevel alias search level is 2,
I        LEVEL(TEST) results in both catalogs being searched, and data
I        sets satisfying both aliases are listed. If TEST and
I        TEST.PROD are not defined as aliases, and there are catalogs
I        called TEST.UCAT1 and TEST.UCAT2, LEVEL(TEST) with a multilevel
I        alias search level of 2 results in both catalogs, as well as
I        the master catalog, being searched for data sets with a
I        high-level qualifier of TEST. In this situation, where a level
I        is being searched that is not also an alias, the master catalog
I        and all user catalogs with the same high-level qualifier and a
I        number of qualifiers equal to the multilevel alias search level
I        are searched for data sets matching the level requested. This
I        situation should not occur if proper aliases are defined for
I        user catalogs.
N
I        When multiple catalogs are searched, the listed entries appear
I        in sorted order within the catalogs to which they belong.
N
I        NOCDILVL | CDILVL:
I          You can only specify NOCDILLVL | CDILVL parameters with the
I          LEVEL parameter.
N
I          NOCDILVL: specifies that only the objects whose patterns
I            match the LEVEL pattern be listed.
N
I            NOCDILVL is the default.
N
I          CDILVL: specifies that DATA and INDEX objects in CLUSTERs
I            and AIXs be listed if at least one of the three objects
I            matches the LEVEL pattern.
N
D    EXPIRATION(days) /* Abbreviation: EXPIR */ -
I      specifies that entries of the indicated type (CLUSTER, DATA, and
I      so on) are to be listed only if they will expire in the specified
I      number of days or earlier.
N
I      days: specifies the number of days. The maximum number that can
I        be specified is 9999 and it indicates that all entries are to
I        be listed. Zero indicates that only entries that have already
I        expired are to be listed.
N
D    FILE(ddname) -
I      specifies the name of a DD statement that identifies the devices
I      and volumes that contain information in the VVDS that is to be
I      listed. If FILE is not specified, the volumes are dynamically
I      allocated. The volumes must be mounted as permanently resident
I      or reserved.
N
D    LIBRARY(libname) /* Abbreviation: LIB */ -
I      specifies the name of the tape library entry for which tape
I      volume entries are to be listed. Only those tape volumes that are
I      entries in the specified tape library are listed.
N
I      libname: specifies a 1-to-8 character tape library name. You can
I        use a partial tape library name followed by an * to list tape
I        volume entries for more than one tape library.
N
D    NAME | -
D    HISTORY | /* Abbreviation: HIST */ -
D    VOLUME | /* Abbreviation: VOL */ -
D    ALLOCATION | /* Abbreviation: ALLOC */ -
D    ALL -
I      specifies the fields to be included for each entry listed.
I      Appendix B, "Interpreting LISTCAT Output Listings" on page 367
I      in the manual, shows the listed information that results when you
I      specify nothing (which defaults to NAME), HISTORY, VOLUME,
I      ALLOCATION, or ALL. For SMS-managed data sets and catalogs, the
I      SMS class names and last backup date are listed in addition to
I      the other fields specified. The class definitions are not
I      displayed.
N
I      Exception: For tape library and tape volume entries, only the
I      ALL parameter is functional. If the HISTORY, VOLUME, and
I      ALLOCATION parameters are specified for tape library and tape
I      volume entries, these parameters are ignored. If ALL is not
I      specified, only the names of the tape library or tape volume
I      entries are listed.
N
I      NAME: specifies that the name and entry type of the entries are
I        to be listed. Some entry types are listed with their associated
I        entries. The entry type and name of the associated entry
I        follow the listed entry's name. For details, see
I        "ASN: Associations Group" on page 376 in Appendix B, and
I        "Interpreting LISTCAT Output Listings," on page 367.
N
I        For TSO/E users, only the name of each entry associated with
I        the TSO/E user's prefix is listed when no other parameters are
I        coded.
N
I      HISTORY /* Abbreviation: HIST */: specifies that only the
I        following information is to be listed for each entry: name,
I        entry type, ownerid, creation date, expiration date, and
I        release. For GDG base and non-VSAM entries, status is also
I        listed. For alternate indexes, "SMS-managed (YES/NO)" is also
I        listed. For SMS-managed data sets, storage class, management
I        class, data class, and last backup date are also listed. If the
I        last backup date is unavailable, as in the case of migrated
I        data sets, LISTCAT displays a field of all "X's" instead of an
I        actual date.
N
I        HISTORY can be specified for CLUSTER, DATA, INDEX,
I        ALTERNATEINDEX, PATH, GENERATIONDATAGROUP, PAGESPACE, and
I        NONVSAM. See examples, Figure 14 on page 414 and Figure 15 on
I        page 417 in the manual.
N
I        The OWNER-IDENT field in the HISTORY subset has been renamed
I        DATASET-OWNER. This displays the contents of the data set owner
I        field in the BCS. The ACCOUNT information is listed when the
I        HISTORY or ALL parameter is specified.
N
I      VOLUME /* Abbreviation: VOL */: specifies that the information
I        provided by specifying HISTORY, plus the volume serial numbers
I        and device types allocated to the entries, are to be listed.
I        Volume information is only listed for data and index component
I        entries, non-VSAM data set entries, and user catalog connector
I        entries.
N
I        For TSO/E users, only the name and volume serial numbers
I        associated with the TSO/E user's prefix are listed when no
I        other parameters are coded.
N
I      ALLOCATION /* Abbreviation: ALLOC */:  specifies that the
I        information provided by specifying VOLUME plus detailed
I        information about the allocation are to be listed. The
I        information about allocation is listed only for data and index
I        component entries.
N
I      ALL: specifies that all fields are to be listed, including fields
I        that are not listed under the NAME, HISTORY, VOLUME, and
I        ALLOCATION options, such as CA-RECLAIM, and fields under
I        ATTRIBUTES, and STATISTICS.
N
I        When multiple catalogs are searched, the listed entries appear
I        in sorted order within the catalogs to which they belong.
N
D    OUTFILE(ddname) /* Abbreviation: OFILE */ /* - */
I      specifies a data set, other than the SYSPRINT data set, to
I      receive the output produced by LISTCAT (that is, the listed
I      catalog entries). Completion messages produced by access method
I      services are sent to the SYSPRINT data set, along with your job's
I      JCL and input statements.
N
I      ddname: identifies a DD statement that describes the alternate
I        target data set. If OUTFILE is not specified, the entries are
I        listed in the SYSPRINT data set. If an alternate data set is
I        specified, it must meet the requirements in "JCL DD Statement
I        for an Alternate Target Data Set".
N
M    CATALOG(mastercatname) /* Abbreviation: CAT */
I      Specifies the name of the catalog that contains the entries to
I      be listed. Search "Catalog Search Order for LISTCAT" for the
I      order in which catalogs are searched.
N
I      This parameter cannot be used to LISTCAT a user catalog, and is
I      ignored when you LISTCAT members of a partitioned data set or the
I      tape library entry. To specify catalog names for SMS-managed data
I      sets, you must have authority from the RACF STGADMIN.IGG.DIRCAT
I      FACILITY class. Search "Storage Management Subsystem (SMS)
I      Considerations" for more information.
N
I      catname: identifies the catalog that contains the entry to be
I        listed.
* End of WISH.
