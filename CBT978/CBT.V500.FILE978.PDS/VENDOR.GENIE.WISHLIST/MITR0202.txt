NWhat are System Symbols?
N------------------------
NSystem symbols are elements that allow systems to share parmlib
Ndefinitions while retaining unique values in those definitions. System
Nsymbols act like variables in a program; they can take on different
Nvalues, based on the input to the program. When you specify a system
Nsymbol in a shared parmlib definition, the system symbol acts as a
N"place holder". Each system that shares the definition replaces the
Nsystem symbol with a unique value during system initialization.

NDynamic System Symbol
N---------------------
NA system symbol whose substitution text can change at any point in an
NIPL. Dynamic system symbols represent values that can change often,
Nsuch as dates and times. A set of dynamic system symbols is defined to
Nthe system; your installation cannot provide additional dynamic system
Nsymbols. Unless otherwise specified, date and time symbols are
Nbased on Coordinated Universal Time (UTC).
N
N   -> &DATE     = Date equivalent to &YR2.&MON.&DAY.
N   -> &LDATE    = (Local) Date equivalent to &YR2.&MON.&DAY.
N
N   -> &DAY      = The day of the month
N   -> &LDAY     = (Local) The day of the month
N
N   -> &DS       = dump section number for multiple data sets in a
N                  transaction dump (TDUMP
N
N   -> &HHMMSS   = Time
N   -> &LHHMMSS  = (Local) Time
N
N   -> &HR       = Hour of the day 00-23
N   -> &LHR      = (Local) Hour of the day 00-23
N
N   -> &JDAY     = Day of the year (often misnamed Julian day)
N   -> &LJDAY    = (Local) Day of the year (often misnamed Julian day)
N
N   -> &JOBNAME  = Name of the job
N
N   -> &MIN      = Minute of the hour 00-59
N   -> &LMIN     = (Local) Minute of the hour 00-59
N
N   -> &MON      = Month of the year 01-12
N   -> &LMON     = (Local) Month of the year 01-12
N
N   -> &SEC      = Second of the minute 00-59
N   -> &LSEC     = (Local) Second of the minute 00-59
N
N   -> &SEQ      = Unique sequence number for DUMPDS 00000-99999
N
N   -> &TIME     = Time a dump was taken equivalent to &HR.&MIN.&SEC.
N   -> &LTIME    = (Local) Time a dump was taken equivalent to
N                  &HR.&MIN.&SEC.
N
N   -> &WDAY     = Three character day-of-week
N   -> &LWDAY    = (Local) Three character day-of-week
N
N   -> &YR2      = Two digit year
N   -> &LYR2     = (Local) Two digit year
N
N   -> &YR4      = Four digit year
N   -> &LYR4     = (Local) Four digit year
N
N   -> &&YYMMDD  = Date equivalent to &YR2.&MON.&DAY.
N   -> &LYYMMDD  = (Local) Date equivalent to &YR2.&MON.&DAY.

NStatic System Symbol
N--------------------
NA symbol whose substitution text is defined at system initialization
Nand remains fixed for the life of an IPL. (One exception, &SYSPLEX,
Nhas a substitution text that can change at one point in an IPL; see
N"Step 6. Code support for system symbols in LOADxx" in the manual for
Ndetails.) Static system symbols are used to represent fixed values
Nsuch as system names and sysplex names.
N
NStatic system symbols have two types:
N
N-> System-defined static system symbols already have their names
N   defined to the system. Your installation defines substitution texts
N   or accepts system default texts for the static system symbols,
N   which are:
N
N   -> &SYSCLONE
N
N   -> &SYSNAME
N
N   -> &SYSPLEX
N
N   -> &SYSR1 (Note: Your installation cannot define substitution text
N      for &SYSR1.)
N
N   -> &SYSALVL (Note: Your installation cannot define substitution text
N      for &SYSALVL.)
N
N-> Installation-defined static system symbols are defined by your
N   installation. The system programmer specifies their names and
N   substitution texts in the SYS1.PARMLIB data set.
