NDD Statement
N============
NSEGMENT Parameter
N-----------------
NIn a JES2 system, use the SEGMENT parameter to allow part of a job's
Noutput to be printed while the job is still executing, or to allow
Nmultiple segments of a job's output to be printed simultaneously on
Nmultiple printers. With SEGMENT, portions of a data set are spun, one
Nsegment at a time. You determine the size of the portion with the
NSEGMENT parameter. SEGMENT allows you to specify the number of pages
Nproduced for a sysout data set before the system processes the segment
Nof the data set. To count pages, JES2 uses the carriage control
Ncharacters in the data that skip to channel 1.
N
NSEGMENT is supported by JES2 only. The SEGMENT parameter applies only
Nto line mode data sets with RECFM=A or RECFM=M. The system might
Nsuspend segmentation if it reaches the threshold for segmentation
Nallowed by JES2.
M
MKenneth Tomiak remark:
MKeep in mind your program could fail and the effect of a restart from
Mthe beginning means printing all over again.

D//             SEGMENT=page-count
I                 page-count: Indicates the number of pages produced
I                             for the sysout data set for the current
I                             segment. When the number is reached, the
I                             system spins-off the data segment for
I                             output processing.
N
NExample 1: 4 Segments if there are 301 to 400 pages.
N----------------------------------------------------
NIn this example, if the sysout data set produced 400 pages, then four
Nseparate segments, 100 pages in each, are produced for output
Nprocessing.
