NSTRIP
N-------
NSTRIP returns string with leading or trailing characters or both
Nremoved, based on the option you specify. The following are valid
Noptions. (Only the capitalized and highlighted letter is needed; all
Ncharacters following it are ignored.)
N
NBoth removes both leading and trailing characters from string.
NThis is the default.
N
NLeading removes leading characters from string.
N
NTrailing removes trailing characters from string.
N
NThe third argument, char, specifies the character to be removed, and
Nthe default is a blank. If you specify char, it must be exactly one
Ncharacter long.
N
M
MWhy am I picky about apostrophe and quote?
M
MFrom http://www.thefreedictionary.com/double+quotes
Mdouble quotes - a pair of quotation marks.
M
MThus the Apostrophe (') and Quote(") are single character values.
MIf you tell me double quotes then I will enter two quotes ("").
MIf you tell me double apostrophes then I will enter two ('').
M('') is not the same as (").
