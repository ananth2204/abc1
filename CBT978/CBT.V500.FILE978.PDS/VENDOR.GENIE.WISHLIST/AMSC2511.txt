NThe JCL statements are:
N-----------------------
N-> SOURCE DD: describes the portable file, TAPE1, which resides on a
N   magnetic tape file that is not mounted by the operator until
N   access method services opens TAPE1 for processing.
N
NThe IMPORT parameters are:
N--------------------------
N-> INFILE: points to the SOURCE DD statement.
N
N-> OUTDATASET: gives the name of the renamed cluster. In this example,
N   the data set either might not exist or, if it does exist, it must
N   not be empty because INTOEMPTY is not specified.
N
N-> OBJECTS: changes some of the attributes for the object being
N   imported:
N
N   -> HRB.EXAMPLE.ESDS1: identifies the entry-sequenced cluster as it
N      is currently named on VSAMBKUP.EXAMPLE.ESDS1(-1).
N
N      -> NEWNAME: specifies that the cluster's name is to be changed to
N         K83.EXAMPLE.SMS.ESDS1.
N
N      -> STORAGECLASS: specifies that the data set requires the storage
N         class, FAST. If the data set K83.EXAMPLE.SMS.ESDS1 existed at
N         the time of the import and was not empty, it would be deleted
N         and redefined. If the data set is redefined, the storage class
N         used for redefinition is derived by the storage class
N         selection routines using FAST as input. The management class
N         used for redefinition is derived by the management class
N         selection routines using the management class in effect when
N         the object was exported.
N
N   -> HRB.EXAMPLE.ESDS1.DATA: identifies the data component as it is
N      currently named.
N
N      -> NEWNAME: specifies that the data component's name it to be
N         changed to K83.EXAMPLE.SMS.ESDS1.DATA.
