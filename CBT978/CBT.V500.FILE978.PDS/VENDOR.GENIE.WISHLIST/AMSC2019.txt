NThe DELETE parameters are:
N--------------------------
N-> PROD: is the name of the ALIAS entry.
N
N-> ALIAS: specifies the type of entry to be deleted. AMS verifies that
N   PROD is an alias entry and then deletes it. If PROD identifies
N   any other entry, AMS does not delete the entry, but notes the
N   discrepancy with a message to the programmer.
N
N-> CATALOG: identifies the catalog containing the entry, MSTRCAT.
