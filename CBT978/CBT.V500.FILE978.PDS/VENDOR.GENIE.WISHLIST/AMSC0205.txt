NNull Command
N------------
NThe null command is a THEN or ELSE command that is not followed by a
Ncommand continuation character. If THEN or ELSE is not followed by
Neither a continuation character or by a command in the same record,
Nthe THEN or ELSE results in no action. The null command supports an
NELSE command that balances an IF-THEN-ELSE command sequence, and
Nallows null THEN commands.
N
NIf you want to indicate a null ELSE command, say:
N
D  ELSE
N
NIf you want to indicate a null THEN command, say:
N
D  IF ... THEN
D  ELSE ...
N
NUse the null command to indicate that no action is to be taken if
Nthe IF clause is satisfied (a null THEN command) or if the IF clause
Nis not satisfied (a null ELSE command).
