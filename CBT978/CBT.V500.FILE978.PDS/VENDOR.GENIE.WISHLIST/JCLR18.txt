NINCLUDE Statement
N=================
NUse the INCLUDE statement to:
N
N->Identify the name of the member of a partitioned data set (PDS)
N  or partitioned data set extended (PDSE) that contains a set of
N  JCL statements (such as DD and OUTPUT JCL statements) called an
N  INCLUDE group.
N
N->Imbed the INCLUDE group in the JCL stream at the position of the
N  INCLUDE statement.
N
NThe INCLUDE group replaces the INCLUDE statement, and the system
Nprocesses the imbedded JCL statements as part of the JCL stream. The
NJCL statements, which are subject to all JCL processing rules, must
Nbe complete statements; that is, you cannot use an imbedded statement
Nto continue the statement that precedes INCLUDE.
N
D//Ýname¨ INCLUDE MEMBER=name Ýcomments¨
N
NThe INCLUDE statement consists of the characters // in columns 1
Nand 2 and four fields:
N
N->name,
N->operation (INCLUDE),
N->keyword parameter (MEMBER), and
N->comments.
* End of WISH.
