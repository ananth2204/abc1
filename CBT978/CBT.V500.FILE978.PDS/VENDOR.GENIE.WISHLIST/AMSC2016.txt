NExample 6: Delete a Key-Sequenced VSAM Cluster
N----------------------------------------------
MTruthfully, we are letting AMS delete whatever type of entry it is.
N
D//DELETE6  JOB ...
D//STEP1   EXEC PGM=IDCAMS
D//SYSIN     DD *
D  DELETE -
D    EXAMPLE.KSDS01 -
D    FILE(DD1) -
D    PURGE -
D    ERASE
D/*
D//SYSPRINT  DD SYSOUT=*
D//DD1       DD DISP=OLD,DSNAME=EXAMPLE.KSDS01,
D//             UNIT=SYSALLDA,VOL=SER=VSER01
N
NThe JCL statements are:
N-----------------------
N-> DD1: specifies the VOLSER where the cluster resides.
N
NThe DELETE parameters are:
N--------------------------
N-> EXAMPLE.KSDS1: which is a key-sequenced VSAM cluster, is the
N   entryname of the object being deleted.
N
N-> FILE: is not required but improves performance if specified.
N
N-> PURGE: specifies that the cluster is to be deleted regardless of
N   its retention period or date.
N
N-> ERASE: specifies that the cluster's data component be overwritten
N   with binary zeros. If the NOERASE attribute was specified when the
N   cluster was defined or altered, this is ignored.
