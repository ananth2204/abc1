NChapter 10: The Generalized Trace Facility (GTF)
N------------------------------------------------
NStopping GTF
N------------
NYou can enter the STOP command at any time during GTF processing. The
Namount of time you let GTF runs depends on your installation and the
Nproblem you are trying to capture, but a common time is between 15 and
N30 minutes.
N
NTo stop GTF processing, enter the STOP command. The STOP command must
Ninclude either the GTF identifier specified in the START command,
Nor the device number of the GTF trace data set if you specified
NMODE=EXT or MODE=DEFER to direct output to a data set. If
Nyou have not specified the GTF identifier in the START command,
Nthen those instances of GTF will have the same identifier:
N
N->  the volume serial number.
N
DSTOP id or device-id
