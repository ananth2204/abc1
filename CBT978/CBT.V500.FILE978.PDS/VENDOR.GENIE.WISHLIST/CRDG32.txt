NChapter 32. TRANSACTION resources
N---------------------------------
NA TRANSACTION resource defines transaction attributes that relate to
Nfunctions provided by CICS.
N
NA CICS application consists of one or more programs written to perform
Na specific function. A particular invocation of such an application is
Nknown as a transaction, and the CICS transaction manager identifies it
Nby its transaction identifier (TRANSID). The TRANSACTION resource can
Nalso be used as an application entry point. Entry points are described
Nin Application entry points.
N
NYou tell CICS how you want your transaction to run, primarily in a
NTRANSACTION definition, by providing such information as the
Ntransaction priority, security key, and the length of the transaction
Nwork area (TWA). The name of this definition, the TRANSACTION name, is
Nthe same as the TRANSID. You also link the transaction with other
Nresources by coding the names of their definitions in the TRANSACTION
Ndefinition. These other resources are PROGRAM, PROFILE, PARTITIONSET,
NREMOTESYSTEM, and TRANCLASS.
