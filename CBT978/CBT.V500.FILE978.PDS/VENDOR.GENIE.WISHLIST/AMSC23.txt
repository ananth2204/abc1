N-----------------------------------
NChapter 23. EXPORT
N------------------
NThe EXPORT command either exports a cluster or an alternate index or
Ncreates a backup copy of a catalog. An empty candidate volume cannot
Nbe exported. Access method services acknowledges and preserves the SMS
Nclasses during EXPORT.

NAccess method services does not use RLS. If an RLS keyword is specified
Non the DD statement of a file to be opened by AMS, the keyword will be
Nignored and the file will be opened and accessed in non-RLS mode.
