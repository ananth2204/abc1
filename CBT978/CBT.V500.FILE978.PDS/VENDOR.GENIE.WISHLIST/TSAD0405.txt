NChapter 4: Stand-Alone dump
N---------------------------
NCopying, viewing, and printing stand-alone dump output
N------------------------------------------------------
NWhen stand-alone dump processing completes the dump, the output resides
Non a tape volume, a DASD, or a combination of devices. The easiest way
Nto view the dump is to copy the dump to a DASD data set. When a
Nstand-alone dump resides on multiple devices and/or dump data sets, you
Ncan concatenate the dump into one data set. After the dump is available
Non DASD, it can be viewed online using IPCS.
N
INote: If the dump resides in a DASD dump data set, IBM recommends that
Nyou copy the dump to another data set for IPCS processing and clear
N(reinitialize) the dump data set using the AMDSADDD or IPCS SADMP dump
Ndata set utilities.
N
N
NCopying the dump to a data set
N------------------------------
NIf you want to view the dump online, copy the dump to a data set.
NThere are two tools you can use to copy the dump:
N
N-> Use the IPCS COPYDUMP subcommand when the IPCS environment has been
N   set up on your system. This is the only option recommended if the
N   dump was written to a multi-volume DASD data set.
N
N-> Use the IEBGENER utility when the IPCS environment has not been set
N   up on your system. Many operators take a stand-alone dump so that
N   the system programmer can view the dump. The operator does not
N   require IPCS on the system because the operator will not be viewing
N   the dump. Therefore, the operator should use the IEBGENER utility
N   to copy the dump to a data set accessible by the system
N   programmer's system.
N
N
NViewing stand-alone dump output
N-------------------------------
NYou can view the stand-alone dump output at a terminal using IPCS. Do
Nthe following:
N
N1. Start an IPCS session.
N
N2. On the IPCS Primary Option Menu panel, select the SUBMIT option to
N   copy the dump and do initial dump analysis.
N
N3. Return to the IPCS Primary Option Menu panel. Select the DEFAULTS
N   option.
N
N4. IPCS displays the IPCS Default Values panel. Enter the name of the
N   data set containing the dump on the Source line.
N
N5. Return to the IPCS Primary Option Menu panel. Select the BROWSE,
N   ANALYZE, or COMMAND option to view the dump.
N
N
NPrinting stand-alone dump output
N--------------------------------
NYou can print an analysis of the stand-alone dump or the entire dump
Nusing IPCS.
N
NTo print an analysis of the dump in batch mode:
N-----------------------------------------------
N
N1. Start an IPCS session.
N
N2. On the IPCS Primary Option Menu panel, select the SUBMIT option to
N   copy the dump and do initial dump analysis.
N
N3. On the IPCS Dump Batch Job Option Menu panel, enter the requested
N   information.
N
N4. On the next panel, enter the sysout output class. IPCS writes the
N   dump analysis to the specified output class.
N
N5. The system prints the dump in the printout of the output class.
N
NTo print the full dump in batch mode:
N-------------------------------------
N
N1. Use IPCS CLIST BLSCBSAP.
N
NExample: Printing an unformatted stand-alone dump
N-------------------------------------------------
NThe following example runs an IPCS CLIST that:
N
N-> Copies the stand-alone dump from the tape data set defined in an
N   IEFRDER DD statement to a cataloged, direct access data set named
N   SA1DASD.
N
N-> Analyzes and formats the dump.
N
N-> Writes the formatted dump output to a data set named IPCSPRNT. A
N   TSO/E CLIST used for IPCS should allocate this print output data
N   set to a sysout print class, as follows:
N
I   ALLOCATE DDNAME(IPCSPRNT) SYSOUT(A)
N
NAfter the CLIST runs, the dump remains available in the SA1DASD data
Nset for supplementary formatting jobs.
