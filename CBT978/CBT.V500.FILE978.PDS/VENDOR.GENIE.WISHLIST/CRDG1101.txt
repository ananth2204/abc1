N---------------------------------
NSyntax:
N-------
D  DEFINE
D    DOCTEMPLATE(name)
I      Specifies the name of this document template
I      definition. The name can be up to eight characters in length.
N
D    GROUP(groupname)
I      Every resource definition must have a GROUP name.
I      The resource definition becomes a member of the group and is
I      installed in the CICS system when the group is installed.
N
I      The GROUP name can be up to 8 characters in length. Lowercase
I      characters are treated as uppercase characters.
N
D    DESCRIPTION(text)
I      You can provide a description of the resource that
I      you are defining in this field. The description text can be up to
I      58 characters in length. No restrictions apply to the characters
I      that you can use. However, if you use parentheses, ensure that for
I      each left parenthesis there is a matching right parenthesis. If you
I      use the CREATE command, for each single apostrophe in the text,
I      code two apostrophes.
N
D    APPENDCRLF(YES | NO)
I      Specifies whether CICS is to delete trailing
I      blanks from and append carriage-return line-feed to each logical
I      record of the template.
N
D    FILE(file)
I      when the template resides in a CICS file, specifies the
I      name of the file. The name can be eight characters in length.
N
I      If you specify this attribute, you cannot specify DDNAME, EXITPGM,
I      HFSFILE, MEMBERNAME, PROGRAM, TDQUEUE or TSQUEUE.
N
D    HFSFILE(hfsfile)
I      When the template resides in a z/OS UNIX System
I      Services file, this specifies the fully qualified (absolute) or
I      relative name of the z/OS UNIX file. The name can be specified as
I      an absolute name including all directories and beginning with a
I      slash, for example, /u/facts/images/bluefish.jpg. Alternatively,
I      it can be specified as a name relative to the HOME directory of the
I      CICS region userid, for example, facts/images/bluefish.jpg. Up to
I      255 characters can be used.
N
I      If you specify this attribute, you cannot specify DDNAME, EXITPGM,
I      MEMBERNAME, PROGRAM, TDQUEUE or TSQUEUE.
N
I      Note: The CICS region must have permissions to access z/OS UNIX,
I      and it must have permission to access the z/OS UNIX directory
I      containing the file, and the file itself. Java Applications in
I      CICS explains how to grant these permissions.
N
D    EXITPGM(program)
I      specifies the name of an exit program that
I      generates a template. The name can be up to eight characters in
I      length.
N

I      HFSFILE, MEMBERNAME, PROGRAM, TDQUEUE or TSQUEUE.
N
D    MEMBERNAME(member)
I      when the template resides in an MVS partitioned
I      data set (PDS), specifies the name of the member containing the
I      template. The name can be up to eight characters in length.
N
I      If you specify this attribute, you cannot specify EXITPGM, FILE,
I      HFSFILE, PROGRAM, TDQUEUE or TSQUEUE.
N
D      DDNAME(DFHHTML | ddname)
I        when the template resides in an MVS
I        partitioned data set (PDS), specifies the DDname of the PDS.
I        the name can be up to eight characters in length.
N
I        If you specify a value for the MEMBERNAME attribute, but do not
I        specify a value for DDNAME, the default value of DFHHTML is taken.
N
I        If you specify this attribute, you cannot specify EXITPGM, FILE,
I        HFSFILE, PROGRAM, TDQUEUE or TSQUEUE.
N
D    PROGRAM(program)
I      when the template resides in a CICS program,
I      specifies the name of the program. The name can be up to eight
I      characters in length.
N
I      If you specify this attribute, you cannot specify DDNAME, EXITPGM,
I      FILE, HFSFILE, MEMBERNAME, TDQUEUE or TSQUEUE.
N
D    TDQUEUE(tdqueue)
I      when the template resides in a transient data
I      queue, specifies the name of the queue. The name can be up to four
I      characters in length.
N

I      FILE, HFSFILE, MEMBERNAME, PROGRAM, or TSQUEUE.
N
D    TEMPLATENAME(template)
I      specifies the name by which the template is
I      known to application programs that use it. The name can be up to
I      48 characters in length.
N

N
D    TYPE(EBCDIC | BINARY)
I      specifies the format of the contents of the
I      template.
