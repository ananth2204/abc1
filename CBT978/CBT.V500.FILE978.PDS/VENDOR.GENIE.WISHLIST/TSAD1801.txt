NChapter 18: Problem Documentation Upload Utility
N------------------------------------------------
NPlanning to use PDUU
N--------------------
NUse the PDUU as the primary utility for sending large volumes of
Ndocumentation, such as stand-alone dumps, to the IBM FTP site. The
Nencryption capability ensures that the transfer occurs in a secure
NManner. AMATERSE is useful for compressing (packing) and unpacking
Nrelatively small amounts of service data, but is incompatible with PDUU
N(output and input), and offers no data transfer capability. If you have
Npreviously used the PDUU, shipped as the MTFTPS stand-alone program
Nfrom:
Uwww-01.ibm.com/support/docview.wss?uid=isg3T1011823
Nyou must understand the following changes made to package the PDUU
Nutility as part of z/OS:
N
N-> The PDUU utility name is AMAPDUPL; however MTFTPS ships as an alias
N   entry point to AMAPDUPL.
N
N-> AMAPDUPL resides in SYS1.MIGLIB (which must be a data set in the
N   LNKLST concatenation), so a STEPLIB DDNAME is not necessary to
N   invoke AMAPDUPL.
N
NPrerequisites and restrictions for PDUU
