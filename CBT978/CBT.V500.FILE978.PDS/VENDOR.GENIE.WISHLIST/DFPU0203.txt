NExample 3: Compare Sequential Data Sets Written at Different Densities
N----------------------------------------------------------------------
NIn this example, two sequential data sets that were written at
Ndifferent densities on different tape units are compared.

NThe control statements are discussed, as follows:
N
N  SYSUT1 DD defines an input data set, SET1, which is the first
N  or only data set on a labeled, 7-track tape volume. The blocked
N  data set was originally written at a density of 556 bits per
N  inch (DEN=1) with the data converter on (TRTCH=C).
N
N  SYSUT2 DD defines an input data set, SET2, which is the first
N  or only blocked data set on a labeled tape volume. In this
N  example, assume SYSUT2 is on a 9-track tape drive.
N
N  SYSIN DD defines the control data set, which follows in the
N  input stream.
N
N  COMPARE TYPORG=PS specifies that the input data sets are
N  sequentially organized.
N
N  EXITS identifies the names of routines to be used to process
N  user input header labels and trailer labels.
N
N  LABELS DATA=NO specifies that the user input header and trailer
N  labels for each data set are not to be compared.
