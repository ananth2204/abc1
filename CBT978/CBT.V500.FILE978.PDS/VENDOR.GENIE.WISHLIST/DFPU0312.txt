NChapter 3. IEBCOPY (Library Copy) Program
N-----------------------------------------
NExample 12: Reblock Load Library and Distribute it to different
NDevice Types
N--------------------------------------------------------------
NIn this example, a load library is distributed (by copying it) to
Ndevices whose maximum block size differs from that on which the
Noriginal load library resides. The library is first reblocked to a
Nmaximum block size that is compatible with each of the devices to which
Nthe library will be copied. Then, the library is copied to those
Ndevices.
N
NThis example illustrates how load libraries can be developed on one
Ntype of direct access device and then distributed to other types of
Ndirect access devices.

NThe control statements are discussed below:
N
N  The REBLOCK EXEC statement begins the reblocking step.
N
N  TESTED DD defines the cataloged load library TESTED.MASTER.LOADLIB.
N
N  STDSIZE DD defines an existing data set, PROGRAM.MASTER.LOADLIB,
N  which resides on a 3390 direct access device and has a block size of
N  23470.
N
N  The COPYMOD statement in the SYSIN data set specifies that
N  TESTED.MASTER.LOADLIB is to be merged into PROGRAM.MASTER.LOADLIB.
N  It also specifies that PROGRAM.MASTER.LOADLIB is to be reblocked
N  with a maximum block size of 13030. This block size is chosen
N  because it is small enough to fit on both 3380 and 3390 direct
N  access devices.
N
N  The DISTRIB EXEC statement begins the distribution step, where the
N  reblocked data set is copied to devices with different maximum block
N  sizes.
N
N  STDSIZE DD defines the same data set that was reblocked in the
N  previous step.
N
N  LIB3380 DD defines the data set PROGRAM.LIB3380.LOADLIB, which
N  resides on a 3380 direct access device.
N
N  The COPY statements in the SYSIN data set specify that the data set
N  PROGRAM.MASTER.LOADLIB is to be copied to the output data sets
N  without being reblocked. If PROGRAM.MASTER.LOADLIB had not been
N  reblocked to the smaller block size, this step would end
N  unsuccessfully.
* End of WISH.
