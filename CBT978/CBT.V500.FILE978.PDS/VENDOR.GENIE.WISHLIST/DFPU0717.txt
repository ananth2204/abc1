NExample 17: Build a Graphic Character Modification Module from
NMultiple Sources
N--------------------------------------------------------------
N3800 Model 1
N
NIn this example, a graphic character modification module is created.
NIts contents come from three different sources: nine segments are
Ncopied from an existing module with the INCLUDE statement;
Nthe GRAPHIC statement is used to select another segment to be
Ncopied; the GRAPHIC statement is also used to establish
Nstatement is also used to establish characteristics for a user-designed
Ncharacter. The new graphic character modification module, when built,
Nis added to the SYS1.IMAGELIB.

NThe control statements are discussed below:
N
N  The SYSUT1 DD statement includes DISP=OLD to ensure that no other
N  job can modify the data set while this job is executing.
N
N  The INCLUDE statement specifies that a copy of the graphic character
N  modification module named CSTW is to be included with the new
N  module. All segments of CSTW, except the third segment (as a result
N  of DELSEG=3), are to be copied into the new module and become the
N  module's first through ninth modification segments.
N
N  The GRAPHIC statement specifies the module's tenth and eleventh
N  segments:
N
N  REF=(1,6A) and GCM=BODE specify that the 10th segment of the new
N  module is to be obtained by copying the first segment from the
N  graphic character modification module named BODE. In addition, the
N  segment's 8-bit data code is to be changed so that its character is
N  identified with the code X'6A'.
N
N  ASSIGN=9A specifies that the new module's 11th segment is a
N  user-designed character whose 8-bit data code is X'9A' and whose
N  width is 10-pitch (the default when no pitch value is specified).
N  The GRAPHIC statement is followed by data statements that specify the
N  character's scan pattern.
N
N  The name of the graphic character modification module is JPCK, it is
N  stored as a new module in the SYS1.IMAGELIB data set.
