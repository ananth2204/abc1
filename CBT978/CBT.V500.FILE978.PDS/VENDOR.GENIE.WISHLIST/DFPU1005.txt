NExample 5: Print Sequential Data Set According to User Specifications
N---------------------------------------------------------------------
NIn this example, a sequential data set is printed according to user
Nspecifications.
N
D//PTNONSTD JOB ...
D//ST01#01 EXEC PGM=IEBPTPCH
D//SYSPRINT  DD SYSOUT=*
D//SYSUT1    DD DISP=(OLD),DSN=SEQSET
D//SYSUT2    DD SYSOUT=*
D//SYSIN     DD *
D         PRINT MAXFLDS=1
D         EXITS INHDR=HDRIN,INTLR=TRLIN
D         RECORD FIELD=(80)
D         LABELS DATA=YES
D/*
N
NThe control statements are discussed below:
N
N  SYSUT1 DD defines the input data set, SEQSET, which is the second
N  data set on a tape volume.
N
N  SYSUT2 DD defines the output data set on the system output device
N  (printer assumed). Each printed line contains 80 contiguous
N  characters (one record) of information.
N
N  SYSIN DD defines the control data set, which follows in the input
N  stream.
N
N  PRINT begins the print operation and indicates that one FIELD
N  parameter is included in a subsequent RECORD statement (MAXFLDS=1).
N
N  EXITS indicates that exits will be taken to user header label and
N  trailer label processing routines when these labels are encountered
N  on the SYSUT1 data set.
N
N  RECORD indicates that each input record is processed in its entirety
N  (80 bytes). Each input record is printed in columns 1 through 80 on
N  the printer.
N
N  LABELS specifies that user header and trailer labels are printed
N  according to the return code issued by the user exits.

MKenneth asks, where is the source for those EXITS?
