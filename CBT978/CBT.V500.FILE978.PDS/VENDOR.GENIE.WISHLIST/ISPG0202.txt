NChapter 2. Description of the ISPF services
N-------------------------------------------
NBRIF-Browse interface
N---------------------
NThe Browse Interface (BRIF) service provides browse functions for data
Naccessed through dialog-supplied I/O routines. The invoking dialog must
Nperform all environment-dependent functions such as file allocation,
Nopening, reading, closing, and freeing. The dialog is also responsible
Nfor any Enqueue/Dequeue serialization that is required. With the dialog
Nproviding the I/O routines, BRIF allows you to:
N
N-> Browse data other than partitioned data sets or sequential files,
N   such as subsystem data and in-storage data.
N
N-> Do preprocessing of the data being browsed.
N
NThe invoking dialog provides addresses of routines that will:
N
N-> Respond to a read request for a specific record by its relative
N   position in the data.
N
N-> Perform processing for the BROWSE primary command. If this routine
N   is not provided, ISPF will process any request for the BROWSE
N   primary command. All addresses must be 31-bit addresses, and the
N   routines must have an addressing mode (AMODE) of 31.
N
NThe dialog-supplied read, write, and command processing routines are
Ncalled directly by ISPF at the same task level (TCB) that displays the
NISPF screens. If you need to ensure that your program runs at the same
Ntask level as the routines, use the SELECT PGM( ) service to start your
Nprogram. This may be a factor if your program expects to create or
Nshare data spaces or other task-specific resources between the main
Nprogram and the read, write, or command routines.
N
NCommand invocation format
N-------------------------
NCommand procedures cannot be used to invoke this service.
N
MWhat-if someone used LINKMVS on ISPLINK? Hmmm.
N
NCall invocation format
N----------------------
D  CALL ISPLINK ('BRIFbbbb', +
D      data-name | 'b', +
I        This parameter allows you to specify a data name for the source
I        data to be browsed. This name will be displayed in the Title
I        line of the default Browse panel; if data-name is not
I        specified, no name is displayed on the panel. This parameter
I        must not have any embedded blanks, and its maximum length is
I        54 characters. This name is stored in ZDSNT in the function
I        pool.
N
D      rec-format, +
I        The record format of the data to be browsed:
I        -> F - fixed
I        -> FA - fixed (ASA printer control characters)
I        -> FM - fixed (machine code printer control characters)
I        -> V - variable
I        -> VA - variable (ASA printer control characters)
I        -> VM - variable (machine code printer control characters)
I        -> U - undefined.
N
D      rec-len, +
I        The record length, in bytes, of the data to be browsed. For
I        variable and undefined record formats, this is the maximum
I        record length. This parameter must be a positive numeric value
I        with a maximum value of 32,760 bytes.
N
I        The dialog can hide data during a Browse session by specifying
I        the record length to be less than the actual data being
I        browsed. By doing this, BRIF displays only the data up to the
I        specified record length.
N
D      read-routine, +
I        A fullword address indicating the entry point of a
I        dialog-supplied read routine. See "Read routinein the manual
I        for more information about this parameter.
N
I        If a read-routine displays its own panel, then a CONTROL
I        DISPLAY SAVE should be done at the beginning of the panel and
I        a CONTROL DISPLAY RESTORE should be done at the end.
N
D      cmd-routine | 'b', +
I        A fullword address indicating the entry point of a
I        dialog-supplied routine that processes the BROWSE primary
I        command or any dialog-specific primary commands. See "Command
I        routine" in the manual for more information about this
I        parameter. If this  parameter is not specified, ISPF initiates
I        a recursive Browse session to handle any request for the BROWSE
I        primary command.
N
I        If a cmd-routine displays its own panel, then a CONTROL DISPLAY
I        SAVE should be done at the beginning of the panel and a CONTROL
I        DISPLAY RESTORE should be done at the end.
N
D      dialog-data | 'b', +
I        A fullword address indicating the beginning of a dialog data
I        area. This address is passed to the dialog-supplied routines.
I        If no address is supplied, zeros are passed to the dialog
I        routines. This data area provides a communication area for the
I        dialog.
N
D      ISRBROBA | panel-name | 'b', +
I        The name of the panel to use for displaying the data. The
I        default is the standard Browse data display panel (ISRBROBA).
I        Refer to GC19-3623-30 (f54PC00_v2r3.pdf) z/OS ISPF Planning and
I        Customizing for information about developing a customized
I        panel.
N
M        SC19-3619-30 (f54dg00_v2r3.pdf) ISPF Dialog Developer's Guide
M        and Reference Chapter 6 and Chapter 7 have the details you want
M        for defining a panel.
N
D      format-name | 'b', +
I        The name of the format to be used to reformat the data. The
I        default is no format. This parameter is provided to support the
I        IBM 5550 terminal using the Double-Byte Character Set (DBCS).
N
D      'NObbbbb' | 'YESbbbb' | 'b' +
I        Specifies whether the data is treated as mixed-mode DBCS data.
I        If YES is specified, the BRIF service treats the data as
I        mixed-mode DBCS data. If NO is specified, the data is treated
I        as EBCDIC (single-byte) data. This parameter is provided to
I        support the IBM 5550 terminal using the Double-Byte Character
I        Set (DBCS).

NBRIF service Return codes
N-------------------------
NThese return codes are possible:
N
D  call_brif_rc = RC
D  SELECT
D    WHEN (call_brif_rc = 0) THEN DO
D      /* Normal completion. */
D      NOP
D    END
D    WHEN (call_brif_rc = 12) THEN DO
D      /* No data to browse. */
D      SAY "Ask your programmer to display it is an empty data set."
D    END
D    WHEN (call_brif_rc = 16) THEN DO
D      /* Unexpected return code received from a dialog-supplied
D         routine; unable to continue. When an unexpected return code
D         is received, the BRIF service terminates immediately with a
D         return code of 16. */
D      SAY "Ask your programmer to fix the the failing" ,
D        "dialog-supplied routine."
D    END
D    WHEN (call_brif_rc = 20) THEN DO
D      /* Severe error; unable to continue. */
D      SAY "Ask your programmer to fix the logic."
D    END
