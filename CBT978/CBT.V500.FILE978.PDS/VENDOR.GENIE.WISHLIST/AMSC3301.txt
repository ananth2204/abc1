N------------------
NSyntax for VERIFY Parameters
N----------------------------
D  VERIFY /* Abbreviation: VFY */ -
N
NRequired Parameters
N-------------------
D    FILE(ddname) | -
D    DATASET(entryname) /* Abbreviation: DS */ -
I      specifies the cluster to be verified.
N
I      FILE: points to a DD statement that specifies the data set.
N
I        ddname: names a DD statement identifying the cluster or
I          alternate index being verified. For further information, see
I          "Using VERIFY to Fix Improperly Closed Data Sets" in
I          z/OS DFSMS Using Data Sets. The data set is deallocated at
I          the VERIFY job step termination.
N
I      DATASET /* Abbreviation: DS */: names the data set that will by
I        dynamically allocated.
N
I        entryname: specifies the name of the object being verified. If
I          DATASET is specified, the object is dynamically allocated.
I          The data set is deallocated dynamically at job termination.
N
I      You can use the VERIFY command following a system error that
I      caused a component opened for update processing to be improperly
I      closed. You can also use it to verify an entry-sequenced data set
I      defined with RECOVERY that was open in create mode when the
I      system error occurred. However, the entry-sequenced data set
I      must contain records (not be empty) to successfully verify.
N
NOptional Parameters
N-------------------
D    RECOVER
I      Completes previously interrupted VSAM processing. The data set
I      cannot be opened on any system; otherwise, the command will fail
I      with an OPEN error.
N
I      Recommendation: When sharing data sets between different
I      processors, IBM recommends that you run VERIFY as the first step
I      of a job stream to prevent job termination caused by an open
I      access method control block (ACB) error code if the other
I      processor already has the data set open. IBM also recommends that
I      you specify the RECOVER parameter after a key-sequenced data set
I      has been closed improperly.
