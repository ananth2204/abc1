NChapter 2. REXX general concepts
N--------------------------------
N  Structure and general syntax
N  ----------------------------
NTokens
N------
NA token is the unit of low-level syntax from which clauses are built.
NPrograms written in REXX are composed of tokens. They are separated
Nby blanks or comments or by the nature of the tokens themselves. The
Nclasses of tokens are:
N
NLiteral Strings:
N----------------
NA literal string is a sequence including any characters and delimited
Nby the single quotation mark (') or the double quotation mark (").
I
ITypists and mainframers know the difference between an apostrophe (')
Iand the quote("). PC people eventually learn quotation mark refers to
Imore than the apostrophe and quote and includes various flavors of
Ismart quotes. So you younger folks have to deal using double single
Iquotation marks and double double quotation marks when writing code.
N
NA literal string is a constant and its contents are never modified
Nwhen it is processed.
N
D'Fred'
D'''Fred'''
D"'Fred'"
D"Fred"
D'"Fred"'
D"""Fred"""
N
NHexadecimal Strings:
N--------------------
NA hexadecimal string is a literal string, expressed using a
Nhexadecimal notation of its encoding. It is any sequence of zero or
Nmore hexadecimal digits (0-9, a-f, A-F), grouped in pairs. The groups
Nof digits are optionally separated by one or more blanks, and the
Nwhole sequence is delimited by single or double quotation marks, and
Nimmediately followed by the symbol X or x.
