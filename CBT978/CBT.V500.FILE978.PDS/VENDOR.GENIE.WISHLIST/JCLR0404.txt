NBackward References
N-------------------
NMany parameters in job control statements can use a backward reference
Nto fill in information. A backward reference is a reference to an
Nearlier statement in the job or in a cataloged or in-stream procedure
Ncalled by a job step. A backward reference is in the form:
N
N-> *.name or *.ddname where name or ddname is the name field of the
N   referenced statement.
N
N-> *.stepname.name or *.stepname.ddname where the referenced statement,
N   name or ddname, is in an earlier step, stepname, in the same job.
N
N-> *.stepname.procstepname.name or *.stepname.procstepname.ddname where
N   this job step or an earlier job step, stepname, calls a procedure;
N   the procedure contains procedure step, procstepname, which contains
N   the referenced statement, name or ddname.
N
NIf stepname is specified without a procstepname, it identifies an EXEC
Nstatement that contains a PGM parameter, not one that invokes a
Nprocedure. Similarly, if stepname.procstepname is coded, procstepname
Nidentifies an EXEC statement containing the PGM parameter in the
Nprocedure invoked by stepname.
N
NThe backward reference lets you copy previously coded information or
Nrefer to an earlier statement. The following parameters can make
Nbackward references:
N
N-> DD CNTL refers to earlier CNTL statement.
N
N-> DD DCB refers to earlier DD statement to copy its DCB parameter.
N
N-> DD DSNAME refers to earlier DD statement to copy its DSNAME
N   parameter, whether or not the data set is a partitioned data set,
N   and whether or not the data set is a temporary data set.
N
N-> DD OUTPUT refers to earlier OUTPUT JCL statement.
N
N-> DD REFDD refers to earlier DD statement to copy its data set
N   attributes.
N
N-> DD VOLUME=REF refers to earlier DD statement to use the same
N   volume(s). The LABEL label type subparameter is also copied from
N   the referenced DD statement.
N
N-> EXEC PGM refers to an earlier DD statement that defines the program
N   to be executed as a member of a partitioned data set.
N
NThe following statements cannot be referenced:
N
N-> DD * statement in DCB, DSNAME, or VOLUME parameter.
N
N-> DD DATA statement in DCB, DSNAME, or VOLUME parameter.
N
N-> DD DUMMY statement in VOLUME or UNIT parameter. The referring DD
N   statement acquires a dummy status.
N
N-> DD DYNAM statement.
N
N-> DD statement containing FREE=CLOSE in VOLUME or UNIT parameters.
N
N-> Nested procedure statements.
N
N-> Sysout DD statement.
N
N-> DD statement that is the target of a DDNAME= reference.
N
N-> A DD statement containing a PATH parameter.
* End of WISH.
