NChapter 2: SVC dump
N-------------------
NAn SVC dump provides a representation of the virtual storage for the
Nsystem when an error occurs. Typically, a system component requests
Nthe dump from a recovery routine when an unexpected error occurs.
NHowever, an authorized program or the operator can also request an
NSVC dump when diagnostic dump data is needed to solve a problem.
