NExample 1: Place Binary Zeros in Records Copied from Sequential
NData Set
N---------------------------------------------------------------
NIn this example, binary zeros are placed in two fields of 100 records
Ncopied from a sequential data set. After the operation, each record in
Nthe copied data set (OUTSET) contains binary zeros in locations 20
Nthrough 29 and 50 through 59.

NThe control statements are discussed below:
N
N  SEQIN DD defines a sequential input data set (INSET). The data set
N  was originally written on a unlabeled tape volume.
N
N  SEQOUT DD defines the test data set (OUTSET). The output records are
N  identical to the input records, except for locations 20 through 29
N  and 50 through 59, which contain binary zeros at the completion of
N  the operation.
N
N  SYSIN DD defines the control data set, which follows in the input
N  stream.
N
N  DSD marks the beginning of a set of utility control statements and
N  refers to the DD statements defining the input and output data sets.
N
N  The first and second FD statements create two 10-byte fields (FIELD1
N  and FIELD2). Because no pattern is specified for these fields, each
N  field contains the default fill of binary zeros. The fields are to
N  begin in the 20th and 50th bytes of each output record.
N
N  CREATE constructs 100 output records in which the contents of
N  previously defined fields (FIELD1, FIELD2) are placed in their
N  respective starting locations in each of the output records. Input
N  records from data set INSET are used as the basis of the output
N  records.
N
N  END signals the end of a set of utility control statements.
* End of WISH.
