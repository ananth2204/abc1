N==============================================================
NChapter 1. Introduction to ISPF services
N----------------------------------------
NISPF services help you develop interactive ISPF applications called
Ndialogs. These services can make your job easier because they perform
Nmany tedious and repetitious operations. In addition, the ISPF services
Nallow you to start a dialog in batch mode and let it run in the
Nbackground while you work with another application in the foreground.
N
NPDF component services communicate with the dialog through dialog
Nvariables. Thus, you can use PDF component services with DM component
Nservices. For information about DM component services and writing
Ndialogs, refer to the z/OS ISPF Dialog Developer's Guide and Reference.
N
NYou can also use PDF component services within edit macros, or you can
Nuse edit macros through the EDIT service. For information about writing
Nedit macros, refer to SC34-4820-10 z/OS ISPF Edit and Edit Macros
Nor PDF ispzem90.PDF.
