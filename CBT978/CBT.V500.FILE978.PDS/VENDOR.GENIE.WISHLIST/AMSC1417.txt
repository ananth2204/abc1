N
NThe DEFINE CLUSTER parameters are:
N----------------------------------
N-> NAME: indicates that the cluster's name is EXAMPLE.KSDS2.
N
NThe DATA component parameters are:
N----------------------------------
N-> ERASE: specifies that the cluster's data is to be erased
N   (overwritten with binary zeros) when the cluster is deleted.
N
N-> EXCEPTIONEXIT: specifies the name of the exception exit routine,
N   DATEXIT, that is to be processed if an I/O error occurs while a
N   data record is being processed.
N
N-> FREESPACE: specifies the amounts of free space to be left in the
N   data component's control intervals (20%) and the control areas
N   (10% of the control intervals in the control area) when data records
N   are loaded into the cluster.
N
N-> KEYS: specifies the location and length of the key field in each
N   data record. The key field is 6 bytes long and begins in the fifth
N   byte (byte 4) of each data record.
N
N-> RECORDS: specifies that an amount of tracks equal to at least
N   500 records is to be allocated for the data component's space. When
N   the data component is extended, it is to be extended in increments
N   of tracks equal to 100 records.
N
N-> RECORDSIZE: specifies that the cluster's records are variable
N   length, with an average size of 80 bytes and a maximum size of
N   100 bytes.
N
N-> VOLUMES: specifies that the cluster is to reside on volume VSER01.
N
NThe INDEX componENT parameters are:
N-----------------------------------
N-> RECORDS: specifies that an amount of tracks equal to at least
N   300 records is to be allocated for the index component's space.
N   When the index component is extended, it is to be extended in
N   increments of tracks equal to 300 records.
N
N-> VOLUMES: specifies that the cluster is to reside on volume VSER01.
