NThe JCL Statements are:
N-----------------------
N-> PDS: allocates the NONVSAM data set with a disposition of SHR.
N
NThe DELETE parameters are:
N--------------------------
N-> EXAMPLE.NONVSAM2(MEM1): is the entryname of a member of the
N   partitioned data set, EXAMPLE.NONVSAM2. The entryname identifies
N   the member to be deleted.
N
N-> FILE(PDS): points to the DD statement PDS which allocates the data
N   set with SHR to the job, hence avoiding dynamic allocation with OLD
N   of the entire PDS.
