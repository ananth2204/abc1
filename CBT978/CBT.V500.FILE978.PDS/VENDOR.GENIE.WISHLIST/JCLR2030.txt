NRESTART Parameter
N-----------------
NUse the RESTART parameter to indicate the step, procedure step, or
Ncheckpoint at which the system is to restart a job. You can specify
Nthat the system perform either of two restarts:
N
N->Deferred step restart, which is a restart at the beginning of a
N  job step.
N
N->Deferred checkpoint restart, which is a restart from a checkpoint
N  taken during step execution by a CHKPT macro instruction.

D//jobname  JOB ,RESTART=({* | {stepname.procstepname},{checkid})
I                 *: Indicates that the system is to restart execution
I                    (1) at the beginning of or within the first job
I                    step or (2), if the first job step calls a
I                    cataloged or in-stream procedure, at the beginning
I                    of or within the first procedure step.
I                 step.procstep: Indicates that the system is to restart
I                    execution at the beginning of or within a step of a
I                    cataloged procedure. Stepname identifies the EXEC
I                    statement of the job step that calls the procedure;
I                    procstepname identifies the EXEC statement of the
I                    procedure step. The step identified by procstepname
I                    must contain the PGM keyword rather than invoke a
I                    procedure.
I                 checkid: Specifies the name of the checkpoint at which
I                          the system is to restart execution. This
I                    checkpoint must be in the job step specified in the
I                    first subparameter.
M
MWhen the system is to restart execution in a job step, place a
MSYSCHK DD statement immediately following the JOB statement.
MThe SYSCHK DD statement defines the data set on which the system
Mentered the checkpoint for the step being restarted.
M
MNote that the stepname and procstepname specified to identify the

MReview all EXEC statement COND parameters.
M
MReview all IF/THEN/ELSE/ENDIF structures.
Mrestart step must be unique within the job.
M
MChange any DISP= Parameters.
M
MCheck all backward references to steps before the restart step.
M
MRefer to a generation data set by its present relative generation
Mnumber.

NExample B2: Restart in the second step from CHKPT3.
N---------------------------------------------------
NThe JOB statement indicates that the system is to restart execution
Nat checkpoint CHKPT3 in job step ST02#05.
N
NThe SYSCHK DD statement must follow the JOB statement; it defines
Nthe data set on which the system wrote checkpoint CHKPT3.
