NOptions
N-------
N    Group(groupname): Specifies only those resource definitions within
N                      the named group. You can specify a generic group
N                      name.
N
N    LIst(listname): Specifies only those resource definitions within
N                    the groups contained in the named list. You can use
N                    a generic list name only if you are not using the
N                    OBJECTS option.
N
N    Objects: Returns the detail of each resource definition. You can
N             extract resource definition data at two levels of detail:
N
N             -> Without the OBJECTS option, the command extracts either
N                the names of all the groups within a specified list, or
N                the names of all the resource definitions within a
N                specified group.
N
N             -> With the OBJECTS option, all the resource definition
N                attributes are also extracted.
N
N             You must specify OBJECTS for the supplied sample user
N             programs DFHxCRFy and DFHxFORy. It is optional for
N             DFH0CBDC and user-written user programs.
N
N    USerprogram(user-written program): Specifies the name of the
N                                       user-written program that is to
N                                       process the data retrieved by
N                                       the EXTRACT command. You must
N                                       supply a USERPROGRAM value.
N
N      CICS supplies three types of sample user program: DFHxCRFy,
N      DFHxFORy, and DFH0CBDC. The letter x in the program name is $
N      for assembler or PL/I and 0 for COBOL. The letter y in the
N      program name denotes the programming language, where y=A is the
N      assembler version, y=C is the COBOL version, and y=P is the
N      PL/I version.
N
N      All other user programs are available in source form, in
N      prefix.SDFHSAMP, and the assembler versions are also available
N      in pregenerated form in prefix.SDFHLOAD.
