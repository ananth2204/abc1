NCalculating Virtual Storage Space for an Alternate Index
N--------------------------------------------------------
N3. The key-pointer pairs are sorted in ascending alternate key order.
NIf your program provides enough virtual storage, access method services
Ndoes an internal sort. (The sorting of key-pointer pairs takes place
Nentirely within virtual storage.)
N
NUse the following process to determine the amount of virtual storage
Nrequired to sort the records internally:
N
N  a. Sort record length = alternate key length + (prime key length (
N     for a key-sequenced data set) or 4 (for an entry-sequenced data
N     set)).
N
N  b. Record sort area size = either the sort record length times the
N     number of records in the base cluster rounded up to the next
N     integer multiple of 2048 (the next 2K boundary), or a minimum of
N     32768, whichever is greater.
N
N  c. Sort table size = (record sort area size/sort record length) x 4.
N
N  d. The sum of b + c = required amount of virtual storage for an
N     internal sort. (The amount for an internal sort is in addition
N     to the normal storage requirements for processing an access method
N     services command.)
N
NIf you do not provide enough virtual storage for an internal sort, or
Nif you specify the EXTERNALSORT parameter, access method services
Ndefines and uses two sort work files and sorts the key-pointer pairs
Nexternally. Access method services uses the sort work files to contain
Nmost of the key-pointer pairs while it sorts some of them in virtual
Nstorage. An external sort work file is a VSAM entry-sequenced cluster,
Nmarked reusable. The minimum amount of virtual storage you need for an
Nexternal sort is:
N
N -> 32768 + ((32768/sort record length) x 4)
N
NThe amount of space that access method services requests when defining
Neach sort work file is calculated as follows:
N
N  a. Sort records per block = 2041/sort record length
N
N  b. Primary space allocation in records = (number of records in base
N     cluster/sort records per block) + 10
N
N  c. Secondary space allocation in records = (primary space allocation
N     x 0.10) + 10
N
NBoth primary and secondary space allocation are requested in records
Nwith a fixed-length record size of 2041 bytes. The control interval
Nsize is 2048 bytes.
N
NThere must be enough space on a single DASD volume to satisfy the
Nprimary allocation request; if there is not, the request fails. To
Ncorrect the problem, specify the volume serial of a device that has
Nsufficient space (see "DD Statements That Describe the Sort Work
NFiles").
