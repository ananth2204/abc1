D  DEFINE
D    ENQMODEL(name)
I      Specifies the 1 to 255-character resource name.

I      You can also use a * (asterisk) as the last character, to denote a
I      generic name.
N
D    GROUP(groupname)
I      Every resource definition must have a GROUP name.
I      The resource definition becomes a member of the group and is
I      installed in the CICS system when the group is installed.
N
I      The GROUP name can be up to 8 characters in length. Lowercase
I      characters are treated as uppercase characters.
N
D    DESCRIPTION(text)
I      You can provide a description of the resource that
I      you are defining in this field. The description text can be up to
I      58 characters in length. No restrictions apply to the characters
I      that you can use. However, if you use parentheses, ensure that for
I      each left parenthesis there is a matching right parenthesis. If you
I      use the CREATE command, for each single apostrophe in the text,
I      code two apostrophes.
N

I      Specifies the name of this ENQMODEL definition. The
I      name can be up to eight characters in length.

I      file. It is not used within the active CICS system.
N
D    ENQSCOPE(scope)
I      Specifies the optional 4-character enqueue model
I      scope name. If omitted or specified as blanks, matching enqueue
I      models will have a local scope.

D    STATUS(ENABLED | DISABLED)
I      Specifies whether the enqueue model is
I      to be installed in ENABLED or DISABLED status. ENABLED is the
I      default.

I      DISABLED: Matching enqueue requests are rejected, and the issuing
I        task is abended. Matching INSTALL CREATE and DISCARD requests are
I        processed.
