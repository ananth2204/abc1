N->comments.

MKenneth Tomiak remark:
MComments are used PRIMARILY to convey information above and
Mbeyond what the JCL constructs show. Just what that information
Mis will vary to meet the desires at each installation.
M
MThe 'Kenneth Tomiak Programming Method' (KTPM03) recommends
Mplacing documentation in a separate library (DOCLIB). It is not
Munusual to have a run-book that contains the documentation about a
Mjob.
I
IInformation Technology Infrastructure Library (ITIL) implemented at
Iits worst:
M
MPicture yourself wanting to correct a spelling mistake in a
Mcomment and learning you must then follow proper change control
Mprocedures. That can get to be a time-consuming activity when
Myou have to:
M
M->Estimate how much time is required to complete the activity.
M  The saying 'Time is money' alludes to budget considerations.
M  * See my Dilbert footnote.
M
M--Prepare a 'management presentation' of why the change is
M  necessary and beneficial. Include a 'Risk Assessment' and
M  how you plan to mitigate those impacts.
M
M->Get buy-in to make the change from all parties impacted.
M  <Sarcasm>
M  Be prepared to explain to the end user (business unit) how
M  important their agreeing to change NOT to NOTE really is.
M  </Sarcasm>
M
M->Create your test cases,  validation plan, implementation
M  plan, and backout plan.
M
M->Create the 'request for change' ticket and wait for management
M  approval.
M
M->Present your justification of doing the change to the "Change
M  Advisory Board" (CAB).
M
M->Wait for CAB approval.
M
M->Copy the production JCL to the development environment.
M
M->Make the change.
M
M->Execute and document all of the test cases required for the JOB(s).
M  You might have changed a PROCedure and need to test several.
M
M->Follow your change control process to move the change forward.
M  What happens next is highly dependent on your change process.
M
M  ->You may need someone in another department to review the
M    change(s) you made.
M
M  ->You may need someone to review your test case(s) and
M    the result(s).
M
M  ->You may need to provide a job (that itself was thoroughly
M    tested) to promote the change to the next level, or prepare
M    a request in a separate system that does so.
M
M  ->A 'Performance and Capacity' group might study your change to
M    discern if there are any negative impacts on the overall system.
M
M  ->The change may pass through a 'Quality Assurance' group that
M    verifies the change meets or exceeds the installations standards.
M    * Be prepared to learn some part you never touched must be
M      fixed before the change can move on. This will blow your
M      time and budget estimate.
M
M  ->End user (business unit) approval may be required to move forward.
M
M->Meet with the implementer(s) and review the implementation
M  plan and backout plan.
M
M->Attend a pre-implementation Change Meeting to entertain questions.
M
M->Wait for approval.
M  What happens next is highly dependent on your change process.
M
M  ->Logon during the maintenance window and validate your change.
M    Capture the result(s).
M
M  ->Assist the end-user (business unit) to get their sign-off
M    the change is correct.
M
M  ->Update the ticket.
M    * Be prepared to have the change backed out when some piece you
M      never touched fails.
M
M  ->Be prepared for the backlash when the production control staff
M    flounder because the documentation still says NOT instead of NOTE
M    when they RESTART using the backed out JCL.
M
MITIL would still have you do a change to a DOCLIB member, but gone
Mare the steps important to an actual JCL statement. And for those
Mthinking 'but we have exemptions...", gone are proving to the
Mauditors those exemptions were justified even though the JOB failed
Mon its next scheduled execution for reasons unrelated to the backed
Mout change.

I* Dilbert footnote:
IPointy haired boss tells Dilbert he will need a plan to justify the
Iresources to change their software. Dilbert responds that he can make
Ithose changes in ten seconds and declares 'Done'. The boss
Icongratulates Dilbert with 'Good Work. Now all we need is that plan'.
