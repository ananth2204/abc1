NProblem data from recovery work areas
N-------------------------------------
NYou can use the recovery work area (RWA) to find the failing module. In
Nmost cases, you would use the TCB and RB structure to find the failing
Nmodule instead of the RWA. Use the RWA in the following situations:
N
N-> When an SVC dump is requested in a SLIP trap. In this dump, the
N   current status at the time of the problem is in the recovery save
N   areas or in the SDUMP SQA 4K buffer.
N
N-> When the problem is in the recovery process itself.
N
N-> When a stand-alone dump is written because of a suspected loop.
N
N
NThe recovery work areas are:
N
N-> Logrec records
N
N-> Logrec buffer in the system: obtained by an IPCS
N
IVERBEXIT LOGDATA
N
Nsubcommand
N
N-> System diagnostic work area (SDWA), including the variable recording
N   area (VRA) formatted in logrec records and in the logrec buffer.
N
N-> Functional recovery routine (FRR) stacks: described in the
N   next topic.
N
N-> Recovery termination manager (RTM) data areas, including the RTM2
N   work area (RTM2WA): formatted by a SUMMARY FORMAT subcommand or
N   obtained in a formatted ABEND or SNAP dump by the ERR option.
N
NThe RTM2WA and SDWA blocks contain registers, PSW, and other time of
Nproblem information. Use these blocks in diagnosis when they are
Nassociated with a task control block (TCB).
