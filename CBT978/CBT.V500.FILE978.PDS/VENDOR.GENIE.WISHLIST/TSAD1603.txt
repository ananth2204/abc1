NChapter 16: SPZAP
N-----------------
NUpdating the System Status Index (SSI)
N--------------------------------------
NYou can use the SETSSI control statement to overlay the existing data
Nin the SSI with your own data.
N
NThe SSI is a 4-byte field created by the linkage editor in the
Ndirectory entry of a load module. It is useful for keeping track
Nof any modifications that are performed on a load module. SPZAP updates
Nthe system status index automatically whenever it replaces data in the
Nassociated module.
N
NNot all load modules have system status information. In those that do,
Nthe SSI is located in the last four bytes of the user data field in the
Ndirectory entry.
M
MThere is rarely a good reason for you to mess with the SSI.
