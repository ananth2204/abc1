NDO-END Command Sequence
N-----------------------
N
D  DO
I    Requires that the group of commands that follow is to be treated
I    as a single unit. That is, the group of commands run as a result
I    of a single IF command. The END command ends the set of commands.
I    A command following a DO must begin on a new line.
N
D  END
I    Specifies the end of a set of commands initiated by the nearest
I    unended DO. END must be on a line by itself.
N
N    Restriction: Do not use continuation characters in the DO-END
N    sequence; they are taken as a null command or cause unpredictable
N    results.
* End of WISH.
