Sam,
I got the email below. I don't know how that member got
corrupted, but there is a new version on your z/OS system with
the name JOARMC.SQLITE38.CNTL.XMIT, if you can replace the file
on the CBT, I'd appreciate it.

Note:  This file now represents the new version described
       by John.  (SBG - Jun 6, 2014)

Hi John,

I spotted this your contribution to the CBT tape and thought it
looked interesting, but I keep getting a file corrupt message
when I try to unpax/unzip file PAXFULL. PAXRUN works fine. Is it
just my copy or do you get the same problem? If so, any chance
you could make a new version available?

Regards,
Staffan
