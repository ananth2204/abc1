Since I'm using your system for this, I thought you might want an
update. I have upgraded the sqlite system from release 3.7.17 to
the just released release 3.8. One thing that I did for this was
to rename the 3.7.17 PDSE library to JOARMC.SQLITE3.CNTL to
JOARMC.SQLITE3.CNTL.V3717. I put the 3.8 into PDSE library
JOARMC.SQLITE38.CNTL. Since the UNIX data is in the
JOARMC.SQLITE3.CNTL.V3717(PAXFULL) member, I deleted the
associated UNIX filesystem VSAM LDS data set. I created a new,
properly sized, VSAM LDS for the release 3.8 UNIX files. This is
named OMVS.JOARMC.SQLITE38.ZFS.

In the new JOARMC.SQLITE38.CNTL, I have made minor updates to the
$README and the SQLITE3A program. I have also updated the
TESTCOB1 program to be a more complete test and example of SQLITE
3.8 via the SQLITE3A interface program.

This is more up to date than the current FILE897. I don't know if
you would want to update the file on CBTTape.org or not. I'm
still doing work, such as the PL/I example. A good "point in time"
data set to post would be JOARMC.SQLITE.V308000.XMIT. (That is
what I posted. SBG)
