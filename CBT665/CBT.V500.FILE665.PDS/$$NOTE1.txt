Input/Output Field Editing Routines

    (Assembler)  I first started putting together this collection
    when I discovered BIF DEDIT didn't do much for fields entered
    into my CICS programs.  But the collection first became a
    set, and also became re-entrant, back in 1993 when I had some
    spare time.  The logic for the numbers to words routine
    (OFMTMONY) was originally in written in COBOL back in 1976
    when another programmer told me I couldn't write the routine
    in COBOL efficiently enough to run in production.

    I updated the installation procedure on September 3, 2003.
    So if you have an earlier version, and have checked back here
    and are worried that the version you got on an earlier date
    needs updating, relax.  There have been no significant
    changes to the routines themselves, just an update to the
    jobstreams that load them onto your system.  And I made a
    minor change to the Installation Verification COBOL program's
    report (the output for IFMTLJST was not printing the field
    returned from the assembler routine).

    The installation/verification jobstream is in fmt$load.tgz.
    That jobstream produced most of the members in this pds.
    When the installation jobs run, they will create a PDS load
    library.  Again, on my system it is configured to reside on
    the same 3330 as the source library and is named
    JAY01.FORMAT.LOADLIB.  These two datasets are referenced in a
    number of DD cards in the jobstreams, so it would probably be
    easiest for you to use a text editor on your host OS
    (Linux/Windows/???) and make all the changes in the "reload"
    jobstream before you submit it to MVS.
