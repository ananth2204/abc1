)F ASM  TSOPUTLN macro - TSO putline not needing setup.

The  macro is  self-contained in  that it  does not  need an  external
subroutine, the subroutine is generated  internally at the first macro
expansion.

The  macro  works even  if  used  in a  mdule  started  with the  BAKR
insteuction, because the generated subroutine uses EXTRACT and LOCASCB
to get the  neccessary runtime info, it does not  rely on tracing back
through save areas.

It  may cause  a slight  performance  degradation as  the module  must
format the message string, so GETMAINs and FREEMAINs a work area. This
has the  added benefit  of making the  subroutine fully  reentrant and
resuable.
