//*           concatenation program which works for SWA above the   *   FILE 831
//*           line.  The program was fixed and commented in French  *   FILE 831
//*           (possibly by Serge Jolicoeur), and the comments and   *   FILE 831
//*           messages were translated into English by Sam Golob,   *   FILE 831
//*           with the help of Jacques.  Anyway, it works.          *   FILE 831
