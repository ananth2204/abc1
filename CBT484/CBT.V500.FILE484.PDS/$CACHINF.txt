 Since Amdahl is no longer in the S390 market  I thought I would
 get around to contributing a utility program I developed for
 Amdahl customers at no charge.

 I call this program Cacheman.  It is an ISPF dialog that
 displays and modifies 3990 (and 3880) cache statuses at both the
 controller and device level.  It has been in use since 1994 at
 over 200 sites worldwide.   I am including a small portion of
 the documentation file here to give you a better idea what this
 utility does.

                        Cacheman (Amdahl Cache Utility)

 This document contains a description of the tool Cacheman, a
 brief history of the product,  a sample of the ISPF panels and
 output from an actual session, and the instructions for
 installing on a host MVS system.

 Description:  Cacheman is a software tool that allows the user
 to display the cacheing status of DASD controllers and devices
 connected to cached controllers.  This dialog is much easier to
 use than the ISMF panels but is NOT a replacement for ISMF.  The
 dialog features a user customizable options panel, logging, and
 field level help.

 Cacheman is an ISPF dialog that formats the output from the
 LISTDATA and SETCACHE commands and displays the results in a
 tabular format.  The status of devices and controllers can be
 easily monitored and modified from these panels.  An options
 panel allows the user to easily 'tailor' certain aspects of this
 dialog.  Help panels and field level help are both available in
 this dialog. It will work for 3990, 3880-11,13,21,23, and 3rd
 party 3990 compatible controllers (Amdahl, Hitachi, EMC, etc)

 Cacheman is coded in TSO/E REXX.  There are three small
 assembler routines which scan the UCB chains and return
 information. No modules require APF authorization. RACF or ACF/2
 authorizations will be required to allow users to issue the
 LISTDATA and SETCACHE commands.

 I am currently still at Amdahl and my phone number at work is
 (408) 746-4784.  email:  chuck_baumann@amdahl.com


 I believe I have all the files in the proper form (TSO XMIT)
 except for the .txt file which is a sequential but was FTP'd to
 my PC in binary format.   The 8 files have been compressed using
 WinZip 7.0.  Chuck Baumann
