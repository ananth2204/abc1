#                  RESETTODUPLEX HELP
!
!  #RESETTODUPLEX!establishes a duplex pair from a suspended duplex pair.
!   The subsystem always attempts to match channel connection addresses
!   (CCAs) and director-to-device connection (DDC) addresses, and will
!   swap the devices after synchronization if a swap would result in a
!   match.  If the pair is swapped, all the data in the cache is inval-
!   idated. DASD Fast Write status and caching status are maintained.
