   The%Cache Utility Option+panel allows you to control whether to create
   a log file for a simple audit trail and whether to display the output
   of each LISTDATA or SETCACHE command in a popup window.

   You may also specify the values for Line commands for both the Controller
   panel and the Device panel.

   You can specify which PFKEY to press to 'refresh' the information of the
   current display.  The previous setting of the PFKEY is saved and restored
   upon exiting this dialog.

   The first time this dialog is invoked this options panel will be displayed
   with default action abbreviations.  You can reset these values to either a
   YES or NO value.  The values will be stored in a application profile.
   You can also change the values at other times by typing%OPT+on the
   command line.
