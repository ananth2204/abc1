   The%Cache Performance Statistic+panel displays the output of cache
   performance over the interval that you specified.

   The only two valid actions from this panel are to press the:
    Enter key      which starts another interval to calculate performance.
      or
    PF3/15 key     which returns to the controller display panel.

   The interval may vary from what you entered depending on when the
   Enter key is pressed.  While waiting for the interval to complete the
   TSO userid is swapped out and is NOT consuming CPU resources.

   Field level help is available.  Position the cursor over one of the field
   values and press PF1 to display help for that field.
