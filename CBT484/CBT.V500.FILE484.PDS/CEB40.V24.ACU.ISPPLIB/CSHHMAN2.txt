   The%Cache Utility Selection+panel allows you to filter the volsers or
   range of addresses that will be included in the displayed panel.

   You must select either a VOLUME, a Group (defined by the user) or a
   RANGE of addresses.  You cannot select from more than one category.

   If you select by%VOLUME+you can enter a full or partial volser and any
   volumes that match will be included in the table that will be created.
   (for example a partial name of VOL  would select volsers like VOL001,
    VOL002, etc)

   If you select by%GROUP+ only those controllers that match ones in the
   group will be displayed on the controller panel.  A GROUP is defined
   from any controller panel by selecting controllers with an M action.
   Existing GROUP members may be modified by typing MEMBER on the command
   line.

   If you select by%address range+any online UCB address that is included
   in this range will be included in the table that will be created.
