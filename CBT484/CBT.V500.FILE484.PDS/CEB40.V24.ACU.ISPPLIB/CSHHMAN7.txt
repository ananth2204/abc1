   The%Exception+panel displays the reason that a controller is considered
   to be in an exceptional state.  This panel will be displayed automatically
   if the user has specified so on the OPT panel.

   Only the controllers that pass the initial selection filtering will be
   checked for exceptions.  The user can modify the CACHXCPT exec to
   add or delete other exceptional conditions that they want checked.

   These conditions are considered exceptions:
     Subsystem cache is OFF
     NVS is in a disabled state (neither ON or OFF)
     This controller has memory offline
     This controller has pinned data
