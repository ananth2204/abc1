   The%Cache Performance Statistic+panel allows you to collect statistics
   of cache performance from a storage controller.  You will specify the
   length of each sample interval in seconds.  The delta between the
   values collected from two LISTDATA COUNTS reports are used to determine
   cache performance.

   For 'realtime' monitoring you should specify 'F' to execute this in your
   current TSO session.  To monitor for longer periods of time or to not
   reserve your TSO session you should specify 'B' in the mode field to
   submit a Batch TSO job.  The report output will appear in the SYSTSPRT
   DD of the batch job.

   For batch jobs you must also enter the number of intervals (reports)
   that you want.  For example   an interval of 900 secs and 4 intervals
   would create 4 reports of 15 minutes each.
