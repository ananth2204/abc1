+  The%Cache Utility+dialog will display the current status of selected
   DASD caching controllers.  It allows a storage administrator to easily
   update the caching status of a controller and/or devices.  It also
   allows the administrator to view counts, status, and pinned data reports.

   This dialog gathers its data from the output of LISTDATA and SETCACHE
   commands. It displays a table with a row for each controller that was
   found during the process of filtering volumes or address ranges.
   Standard PFkeys are used to scroll up and down.

   The modifiable fields are for subsystem cache status, SD cache status,
   and NVS.  The valid values for these fields are%ON+or%YES+,%OFF+or%NO+.
  %To modify these statuses you just key over the existing status;+no
   line command operator is required.

   Valid primary commands are:
   %SORT+    UNIT, MEM or CACHE, SSID, NVS,   A scending or D escending
   %DCACHE+  Display status of all cached volumes for this system.
   %EXCEPT+  Display controllers with exceptionsal conditions from selected.
   %MEMBER+  Display a panel for modifying an existing selection group member.
   %NEW+     Display changed and new features for this release.
