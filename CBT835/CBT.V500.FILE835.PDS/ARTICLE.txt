Scanning the PPT

The Program Properties Table (PPT) contains a list of programs
that require special properties such as:

1      Being non-swappable

2      Having a program protect key other than 8

3      Running in privileged state

4      Dataset integrity

5      Bypass security protection

6      CPU affinity.

MVS/ESA is packaged with a default PPT that contains IBM
programs that require these special properties. Examples of these
programs are:

1      IEEMB860 - Master

2      HASJES20 - JES2

3      CSVLLCRE - LLA

4      IFASMF - SMF.

The properties are assigned at job-step attach time by the initiator
module IEFSD162. An installation can supplement the IBM
default list at IPL time by using the PARMLIB member
SCHEDxx or dynamically using the operator SET SCH=(xx,L)
command. This article contains an ISPF/PDF windowed dialog
that will display all the entries in the PPT and, for each program,
will display the assigned properties. To obtain the PPT entries, the
IEFPPSCN macro is used. This prevents the system from
dynamically updating the PPT while it is being scanned.

This dialog is made up of the following code elements:

o      PPTPAN01 - panel.

o      PPTPAN02 - panel.

o      PPTSCAN - Assembler routine which obtains the PPT
      information by executing macro IEFPPSCN. It communicates
      the PPT details back to the REXX program PPTSCANR by
      calling IKJCT441 to create REXX stem variables. PPTSCAN
      will set the following return codes:

      0 - successful invocation

      4 - stem build error

      8 - PPT scan error.

o      PPTSCANR - REXX EXEC which calls PPTSCAN to
      obtain the PPT information for display.

The Assembler routine PPTSCAN must be linked into an
authorized library with the attribute AC(1); this is because of the
requirements of the IEFPPSCN macro. The TSO PARMLIB
member IKJTSO00 must be updated to include command
PPTSCAN in the AUTHCMD section of this member. To invoke
this dialog execute the REXX EXEC PPTSCANR from an ISPF
menu panel or from option 6 of TSO. The REXX EXEC
PPTSCANR includes a LIBDEF command for panel invocation.
This can be removed or updated as required.
