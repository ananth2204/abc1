(I didn't have to email myself.)

This note is from Sam Golob, and concerns the new program called
PPTD (PPT Display), and its associated members.  All new members
included in this pds are:

  PPTD   -  PPTD assembler source for PPT display program
  PPTD$  -  JCL to assemble and linkedit PPTD
  TSOB   -  REXX to trap and ISPF Browse PUTLINE program output
  TSOE   -  REXX to trap and ISPF Edit PUTLINE program output
  TSOR   -  REXX to trap and TSO REVIEW PUTLINE program output
  TSOV   -  REXX to trap and ISPF View PUTLINE program output

PPTD is an APF-authorized TSO command which displays the PPT entries
on the TSO screen, and not in an ISPF pop-up window the way PPTSCANR
does.  The advantage is that you can trap the output and use the
TSOx display REXX programs from Mark Zelden, to display the command
output in scrollable, full-screen mode.  In particular, TSOR does
not need ISPF.  TSOR can be run from TSO READY mode, because it
invokes the REVIEW TSO command which does not need ISPF.  REVIEW is
on CBT File 134 (source modules) and 135 (load modules).  (Generally
include all members starting with REV**** and their aliases.)

A not-generally-known fact about the newer versions of the REVIEW
command, is that it has an ISPF-Edit-like attachment called REVEDIT,
which allows ISPF-like editing of datasets, while in TSO READY mode,
without ISPF being present.  To enter REVIEW's EDIT mode, type UPDATE
in the REVIEW command line, or U in a REVIEW member list instead of S.

I use the EDIT function of REVIEW as an ISPF recovery tool, when
ISPF can't come up because of allocations and such.  I fix the
allocation CLISTs with REVIEW's EDIT function, and then bring ISPF
up when everything is right.

PPTD follows the same display logic as PPTSCAN and PPTSCANR, and
contains pretty much the same information as they do.

To authorize the PPTD command (as well as the PPTSCAN command), they
must be listed in the PARMLIB member IKJTSOxx under AUTHCMD (NAMES()).
For other (niftier) methods of authorizing a TSO command, see CBT
Files 185 and 797.

Any questions, please write to Sam Golob.

Best of everything.......
