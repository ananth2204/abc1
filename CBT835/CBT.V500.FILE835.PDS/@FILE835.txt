//***FILE 835 is from Peter Giles and contains a corrected version  *   FILE 835
//*           of the PPT scan program package that was published    *   FILE 835
//*           in the Xephon MVS Update issue of November 1994.      *   FILE 835
//*           This package displays its output in an ISPF pop-up    *   FILE 835
//*           window, using the REXX exec called PPTSCANR.          *   FILE 835
//*                                                                 *   FILE 835
//*           This program was originally written and submitted     *   FILE 835
//*           to Xephon by R.F. Perretta.  Xephon materials (most   *   FILE 835
//*           of them) are now supported at www.cbttape.org.  The   *   FILE 835
//*           original program was on CBT Tape File 830, member     *   FILE 835
//*           A1E1B892.  Look there.  There are 926 articles        *   FILE 835
//*           there, in CBT File 830, which contain a lot of good   *   FILE 835
//*           stuff.  You can now use these Xephon materials in     *   FILE 835
//*           good conscience.                                      *   FILE 835
//*                                                                 *   FILE 835
//*           Program PPTSCAN has to be run APF authorized and be   *   FILE 835
//*           in the AUTHCMD (IKJEFTE2) table.  See CBT File 185    *   FILE 835
//*           for help.  Parmlib member IKJEFTxx is the affected    *   FILE 835
//*           PARMLIB member (entry AUTHCMD (NAMES(...)).           *   FILE 835
//*                                                                 *   FILE 835
//*     >>>>  Added members:  PPTD, PPTD$, TSOV, TSOE, TSOB,        *   FILE 835
//*                 and TSOR, described as follows:                 *   FILE 835
//*                                                                 *   FILE 835
//*           Sam Golob has written another program, PPTD, to       *   FILE 835
//*           display the PPT entries.  This one is a vanilla TSO   *   FILE 835
//*           command, APF authorized, which does not use ISPF,     *   FILE 835
//*           but which uses the TSO PUTLINE interface, enabling    *   FILE 835
//*           the output to be trapped and displayed                *   FILE 835
//*           (full-screen) using Mark Zelden's TSOV, TSOB, TSOE    *   FILE 835
//*           and TSOR execs, which are included here.  These       *   FILE 835
//*           execs trap the command output, and (respectively)     *   FILE 835
//*           ISPF VIEW, EDIT, BROWSE it.  TSOR calls Greg          *   FILE 835
//*           Price's REVIEW command that doesn't need ISPF (CBT    *   FILE 835
//*           Files 134, 135) and displays ALL the output,          *   FILE 835
//*           full-screen and scrollable, from TSO READY mode.      *   FILE 835
//*                                                                 *   FILE 835
