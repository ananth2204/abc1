Sam

This is a PPT display using a load module to supply a Rexx
routine.

The display is similar to MXI, PPT .
I noticed the error when comparing MXI;PPT  and the PPT display
I have highlighted the two corrections to the assembler code.

Hi Peter,

    I'll try and get to this when I can.  Thanks for pointing it
    out.  If I have questions about what the code is supposed to
    do, I'll ask them now.  What is the code supposed to do?  And
    what did you correct?  Thanks much.

    All the best of everything to you and your family.

Sincerely,    Sam
