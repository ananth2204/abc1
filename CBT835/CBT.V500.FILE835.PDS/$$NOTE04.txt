Version 1.2.1 - Mar 20, 2019

Fixed return code processing even though you think you may not
need it.  After all, you're just displaying the PPT entries, and
what do you need a return code for (if you're authorized and it
works)?

Well, the return code processing was messed up, and I fixed it so
that if you are authorized, you have RC=0, and if you're not
authorized, you have RC=4 (the default "bad code" from the TESTAUTH
macro).

If you want, you can set the non-auth return code to anything you
want.  See the line after label NOTAUTH in column 1.
