//***FILE 794 is from Daniel F. Gaeta and contains a useful REXX    *   FILE 794

//*    I am a Rexx lover and the RXMEM is one more function         *   FILE 794
//*    from my personal library that I would like to share          *   FILE 794
//*    with you.                                                    *   FILE 794
//*                                                                 *   FILE 794
//*    As I work with other languages, like Java, VB, Pascal        *   FILE 794
//*    and C++, sometimes I need to use linked list, in Java        *   FILE 794
//*    for example, ArrayList class...                              *   FILE 794
//*                                                                 *   FILE 794
//*    That is an interesting technique to manage items from a      *   FILE 794
//*    list, using to resources like insert, add to end, count      *   FILE 794
//*    items, delete items and other.                               *   FILE 794
//*                                                                 *   FILE 794
//*    Now I am provinding the first version of RXMEM.              *   FILE 794
//*                                                                 *   FILE 794
//*    The RXMEM has the following features :                       *   FILE 794
//*      - to manage token pair service, using IEANTxx modules      *   FILE 794
//*      - to manage getmain and freemain memory                    *   FILE 794
//*      - to manage linked list options                            *   FILE 794
//*                                                                 *   FILE 794
//*    As I am working on improvements, I am not delivering         *   FILE 794
//*    the source code.  Just a rexx samples.                       *   FILE 794
