Hello Sam!

How are you? I'm fine and I hope you too!

Recently I needed to use a common feature from OO languages,
something like an ArrayList class from Java, TArrayList from
Delphi/Pascal, STL Linked List from C++ and others.

So... Would be very interesting have this feature in REXX
language... I am providing a version 1.00.

RXMEM is very useful to manage linked lists, obtain/release
memory and token pair services.

I am sending a loadlib and sample libraries.

Let me know if you need an additional informations.

Thank you,
Daniel
