Hi Sam,

I apologize for the repeat email, but I found a few things in my
previous attempt that did not make me happy!!

I have attached an updated LISTDCQ rexx command.  The previous
version did NOT check for the Ulut type. I am not sure how many
folks are running older version of z/OS than 1.7, but the last
iteration of my LISTDCQ would NOT have worked for them.

Also, the original version from file 221 compared the total
scanned UCBs to the counts provided in the DCQ header. This
updated version now compares the scanned UCBs to the counts
proved in the ULUT header.

I am happier with this version, I hope you are too.

Thanks
Tony

Hi Tony,

    What a pleasure it is to hear from you!  I was going to fix
    LISTDCQ the exact same way, but you beat me to it.  I am
    glad, because you learned a bunch of stuff along the way.
    Thanks for pointing out that the DCQ was partially obsolete
    because of UCBs being moved above the line.

    I haven't tried your stuff out yet, but I will, in about 5
    minutes.

    All the best of everything to you and your family.

Sincerely,    Sam
