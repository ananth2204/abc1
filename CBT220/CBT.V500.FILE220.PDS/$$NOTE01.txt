Hi Sam,

Thanks for the updates!!!

I like the REXXES member in File 220.  It make it easier to copy
them right into your SYSPROC dataset(s).  Also, I had a look at
your UCBTYPE command from File 731 and I like that too.  Just like
UCBDASD and UCBTAPE, they make a suitable alternative for the
LISTDCQ, LISTDASD and LISTTAPE Rexxs from File 221.

Also, I took the liberty of modifying the LISTDCQ command (Rexx)
from File 221.  This new version uses the same logic for scanning
the DCQ as before, but now, uses the ULUT for scanning the UCBs
in the system.  (Thanks to the education you UCBTYPE command
provided me!!!)  It really provides the same information as
UCBTYPE, but it is written in Rexx.

I offer it for your review in case you would like to include it
in File 221.  It is attached to this email!!

It is interesting to note that UCBs that have been moved "above
the line" are NOT chained in the DCQ.

Thanks
Tony

Hi Tony,

I converted some of the REXXes in File 221 to FB-80 and put them
on File 220 as member REXXES.  I also added a member to File 220
called $$$FB80 which describes what I did.  Please take a look
and see what you think.  I also hope to try and fix some of the
REXXes that don't work on z/OS, but that's for later.

Please let me know what you think.

All the best of everything to you and your family.

Sincerely,   Sam
