Note from Sam Golob     (March 5, 2014)

Addition to CBT File 220, from CBT File 221.

I converted many of the LIST*** REXXes to FB-80, so I could
include them in my SYSPROC concatenation which is FB-80, as
opposed to VB-255.  These are really valuable and
easily installable tools, to help you (or the auditors) to get
a better insight into the specific workings of your MVS
system.

The REXXes that I have not yet converted, are the ones which
don't seem to work right under z/OS 1.13 (although I may have
missed one or two which do work).  These are on my "to do" list,
to improve, both in the FB-80 and VB-255 versions.

Notes on this:
  LISTDCQ has been fixed for z/OS by Tony Cieri.
  LISTDASD and LISTTAPE have been fixed by Tony Cieri.

The IO*** members have not been converted.

Lee Conyers (who has passed on) was really an expert auditor
and he knew a lot about what makes the system tick, especially
in those areas that an auditor has to watch.  It is a pleasure
to be able to use his excellent tools.  That is why I have
tried to make them even more useful, for today's environment.

For the record, SHOWzOS on CBT File 492 (load module collection
on CBT File 614) is also extremely useful to supplement this
information obtainable with the REXXes here.

All the best of everything to all of you.

Sam
