Here is the xmit file package.

It s a start, but I think I have a number of utilities that I can
add to it as time goes by.

So far there are two utilities:

1) A Rexx/ISPF exec that shows control blocks and information
   regarding 522 timeouts.

2) A Rexx assembler function to write SMF records.  Uses BPX1SMF.

All the best to you and your family as well.
