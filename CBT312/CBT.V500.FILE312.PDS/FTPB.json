Dyck\n\n\nThis ISPF dialog provides a simple to use ISPF interface for using the\nTCP/IP FTP function to transfer data sets from the current MVS host\nsystem to other host systems that support a TCP/IP FTP Server (e.g. MVS,\nVM, OS/2, most Unix, ...).\n\nThe dialog present the user with a simple ISPF panel from which to\nspecify the source (original) data set, the target host, optionally the\nname of the target data set if it is different from the source, and\nsignon information (userid and password).  Once this information is\ncomplete the dialog generates the necessary JCL and FTP statements to\nallow the user to execute the FTP in the foreground (execpt for load\nlibrary transfers) or to submit the JCL for a batch execution of FTP.\nPrior to submission the user is allowed to review and change (edit) the\ngenerated JCL and FTP control statements if they desire.\n\nThe JCL will be submitted using an FTP service that will wait for 10\nminutes (as defined by the FTP.DATA used by the installation) and if the\nJOB ends within 10 minutes the sysout will be retrieved and printed in\nthe FTPPRINT generated step.  The PRINT job step will print the report\nto the //REPORT DD and will process the data to generate a return code\nequal to the max return code for the remote job.\n\nFor partitioned data sets the dialog provides member selection if a\nmember is not specified as part of the source data set name.  Two\noptions are provided for the transfer of a PDS.  One option is to unload\nthe data set using IEBCOPY and to transfer that sequential data set,\nwhile generating the JCL to reload the data set at the target host.  The\nother option is to not unload in which case the dialog processed a member\nat a time.\n\nFor VSAM and DA data sets the dialog will prompt to ask if the target\ndata set should be Replaced or not on the restore.  The transfer will\noccur in batch using generated JCL. To transfer VSAM/DA the dialog uses\nIBM's DFSMSdss (PGM=ADRDSSU) to DUMP the data set (using the SPHERE\noption) and then the restore JCL and the dump'd data set are FTP'd to\nthe target host.  Once these FTP's are complete the JCL is submitted to\nthe target system for processing where ADRDSSU will be used to RESTORE\nthe data set.  The batch process is the same as described above for load\nlibrary transfers except that ADRDSSU is used instead of IEBCOPY.\n\nAlso supported are pattern dsnames which will then consist of a set\nof data sets dump'd and restore'd using ADRDSSU.\n\nKnown Problems/Challenges:\n\nNOTE: that 2 and 4 have been fixed and the dialog has been\n      updated but if you have these problems you can uncomment\n      the code to return these restrictions.\n\n1.  There exists a problem when using FTP to transfer load modules\n    caused by the inability of FTP to correctly transfer the directory\n    information for the load module.  The 'solution' for this is to\n    use IEBCOPY to unload the load library into a sequential data set\n    and then transfer that with a reload using IEBCOPY at the target\n    site.\n\n2.  The FTP of an IEBCOPY UNLOAD'd PDS where the original PDS had a\n    BLKSIZE of 32753 or greater results in a data set that FTP is\n    unable to successfully transfer.  The dialog will detect this and\n    present the user with a warning panel and not perform the\n    transfer.  The data set must be reblocked prior to the IEBCOPY\n    UNLOAD.\n\n    ** This has been fixed (YES) but you must have the maintenance to\n       support VBS dataset transfers.\n\n3.  The submitted JOB's SYSOUT will remain at the remote executiion\n    site in the SPOOL until the SPOOL cleanup removes it as it is\n    submitted with an OUTPUT JCL statement to be held so that it can\n    be retrieved by the FTP GET (when filetype=jes is used) and thus\n    included in the originating JOBs SYSOUT.\n\n4.  The FTP of a RECFM=VBS dataset will not work directly until IBM\n    fixes the FTP Client (target is with OS/390 2.5 release maybe).\n    This transfer will use DFSMSdss just as VSAM for now.\n\n    ** This has been fixed (YES) but you must have the maintenance to\n       support VBS dataset transfers.\n\n5.  When using DFSMSdss to dump/ftp/restore a PDSE the target may not\n    restore if PDSE is not enabled and you will need to use the CONVERT\n    statement (check the manual for syntax) in the restore.\n\nProduct Components\n\nThe product consists of the following elements:\n\n    ISPF Panels:\n\n    FTPB             Primary ISPF Panel called by FTPB\n    FTPBEXEC         Patience panel displayed for online FTP executions\n    FTPBGS           Submit/Exec ISPF Menu for non-unload transfers\n    FTPBGSU          Submit ISPF Menu for unload transfers\n    FTPBGSUP         Information on submitted job if reload used\n    FTPBHF*          ISPF field level tutorial panels\n    FTPBHFx          Field level help\n    FTPBH0           ISPF Tutorial Panel for FTPB\n    FTPBH1           ISPF Tutorial Panel for FTPBGS\n    FTPBH2           ISPF Tutorial Panel for FTPBGSU\n    FTPBM            ISPF member selection Panel\n    FTPBSHST         Host selection panel\n    FTPBPDSS         Transfer Prompting when using DFSMSdss\n    FTPBPPDS         PDS Transfer Prompting\n    FTPBPRCL         Prompt to recall for himgrated datasets\n    FTPBSITE         Panel display of target allocation options\n    FTPBPWRN         Warning for Unsupported Blksize Transfer  **\n\n    ** -
