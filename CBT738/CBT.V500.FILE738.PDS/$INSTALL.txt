Installation Instructions:

1) After RECEIVING THE XMI file into a Dataset (You have already done
   that or you would not be looking at this member), go to SPF option
   6 command line and enter this command:

      EXEC  'XXXXXXXX.REORGVS(INSTALL)'

   Where XXXXXXXX is the HLQ of this dataset.  The INSTALL Rexx exec
   will tailor and copy the REORGVS members to your runtime libraries
   after prompting you for these 4 pieces of information:

       1) Output Dataset name containing the PDS members
          created by the RECEIVE INDS command (and is also
          the dataset which contains this Rexx Exec).
       2) The HLQ (High-Level Qualifier) to be used to install
          the REORGVS runtime libraries.
       3) The Volser to be used to allocate the runtime
          libraries and Logfile.
       4) The Dataset name of the exec library concatenated
          to ddname SYSPROC to copy the REORGVS exec into
          for foreground invocation of exec REORGVS.

   After prompting for these 4 pieces of information
   it will tailor the install file members and the
   user will then be ready to continue the install of
   this product.

2) After the INSTALL exec completes, the following members should
   reside in the following libraries:

        XXXXXXXX.REORGVS.CNTL  (Where XXXXXXXX is HLQ above):

            INSTALL2
            INSTALL3
            IVPTEST
            REORGVSS

        XXXXXXXX.REORGVS.EXEC  (Where XXXXXXXX is HLQ above):

            DYNALC
            REORGVS
            REORGVSX
            REORGVS1
            REORGVS2
            REORGVS3
            REORGVS4
            REORGVS5
            REORGVS6

        XXXXXXXX.REORGVS.PANELS (Where XXXXXXXX is HLQ above):

            REOHGPN1
            REORGPN1
            REORGPN2

        XXXXXXXX.REORGVS.MSGS   (Where XXXXXXXX is HLQ above):

            REOM00

        XXXXXXXX.REORGVS.SOURCE  should be empty.

        XXXXXXXX.REORGVS.LOADLIB should be empty.

        XXXXXXXX.REORGVS.LOGFILE should be empty.

3) Edit Rexx execs "REORGVS", 'REORGVSX', "REORGVS1", "REORGVS2",
   'REORGVS3', "REORGVS4", "REORGVS5" AND "REORGVS6" in dataset
   "XXXXXXXX.REORGVS.EXEC" (Used in step 2) above).
   Tailor the execs to suite your specifications by reading and
   applying the tailoring instructions in the comment with the
   eye-catcher of "Modifications/Tailoring:" in the exec.

4) Submit the following job to assemble the two programs used by
   the REORGVS facility.  The assemble and link should recieve
   a return code 0.  You will have to insert your installation's
   jobcard before you submit the job.

      SUB  'XXXXXXXX.REORGVS.CNTL(INSTALL2)'

   This job assembles the two programs used by the REORGVS facility.

5) Submit the following job to copy the REORGVS Rexx exec and the
   REORGVSX Rexx exec into the SYSPROC concatenation library.
   You will have to insert your installation's jobcard before
   you submit the job.

      SUB  'XXXXXXXX.REORGVS.CNTL(INSTALL3)'

6) EDIT 'XXXXXXXX.REORGVS.CNTL(REORGVSS)'.  Insert your
   installation's jobcard before you use the REORGVS facility.

   IMPORTANT NOTE !!!:
   After inserting your facility's JOBCARD, note the following ...

   DO NOT CHANGE member "REORGVSS" !!!!  This member is a skeleton
   JCL member which will be tailored and submitted at execution time.
   The symbolic variables in this member are updated by the REORGVS
   process to reorg VSAM files.  The skeleton jcl should not be
   changed after it is tailored by step 1) above.
   These are updated at execution time by the facility to
   subsitute for the necessary information to perform the REORG.

7) COPY and RENAME MEMBER 'XXXXXXXX.REORGVS.CNTL(REORGVSH)'
   into your ISPF facility Help library allocated to ddname
   SYSHELP. Rename the member to REORGVS using the following job.
   You will have to insert your installation's jobcard before you
   submit the job.

      SUB  'XXXXXXXX.REORGVS.CNTL(INSTALL4)'

8) COPY the ISPF Panel and Message members into your ISPF
   panel and messages libraries allocated to ddnames ISPPLIB and
   ISPMLIB.
   You will have to insert your installation's jobcard before you
   submit the job.

      SUB  'XXXXXXXX.REORGVS.CNTL(INSTALL5)'

9) To test the REORGVS facility, update member IVPTEST with the
   VSAM file which you wish to reorganize and then submit the job.
   You will have to insert your installation's jobcard before you
   submit the job.

      SUB  'XXXXXXXX.REORGVS.CNTL(IVPTEST)'

   This job should get a return code zero and also submit a
   reorg job into the internal reader.  The jobname will be
   in the form  REORGnnn  where nnn is a random number.
   (If the TEST parameter is passed, the jobname will be in the
   form REORGTnn where nn is a random number.)
   Each REORGVS command issued in the Background TSO step (or
   in the foreground for that matter) will generate one of these
   or more of these REORGnnn jobs (or REORGTnn jobs with the
   TEST paramemter).

   The REORGnnn and REORGTnn jobs should end with a condition
   code of 0 or 4.
   Condition code 4's are issued in cases where a Discrete
   Racf profile does not exist for the VSAM cluster being
   reorganized.

   You are now ready to use the facility.

   IMPORTANT NOTE !!!

   Do not change member "REORGVSS" !!!!  This member is a skeleton
   JCL member which will be tailored at execution time.  The
   symbolic variables in this member are updated by the REORGVS
   process to reorg VSAM files.  The skeleton jcl should not be
   changed after it is tailored by step 1) above.
