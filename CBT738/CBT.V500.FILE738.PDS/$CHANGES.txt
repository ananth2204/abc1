            - MODIFICATION LEVEL: V01.02.02
            - CORRECTED HELP SCREEN REORGVSH OPERANDS.
            - MODIFIED REXX EXEC REORGVSX TO ELIMINATE SOME REDUNDANT
              CODE.
              MODIFIED ABENDER SOURCE TO REMOVE JCL (ALLOW IT TO
              ASSEMBLE).
                (THANKS TO MICHAEL MAYNE.)

 05/26/2009 - V01.02.01

            - ADDED A SECOND INVOCATION REXX EXEC CALLED REORGVSX TO
              PERFORM THE I/O AND WORK.  EXEC REORGVS BECAME A FRONT-END
              EXEC TO INVOKE AN ISPF ENVIRONMENT IF THE USER INVOKES
              REORGVS IN THE FOREGROUND.  REORGVS CONTINUES TO WORK
              AS IT DID BEFORE IF IT IS INVOKED IN THE BACKGROUND WITH
              THE EXCEPTION THAT THERE ARE NOW TWO INVOCATION EXECS
              (REORGVS WHICH CALLS REORGVSX TO DO THE WORK).

            - MODIFIED REXX EXEC REORGVS
                (REQUIRES SITE TAILORING FOR SYSPROC LIB)
              ADDED ONE NEW REXX EXEC REORGVSX
                (REQUIRES SITE TAILORING FOR ISPPLIB AND ISPMLIB LIBS)
            - ADDED THREE NEW ISPF PANELS: REORGPN1, REORGPN2, REOHGPN1
            - ADDED ONE   NEW ISPF MESSAGE MEMBER: REOM00
            - MODIFIED THE SYSHELP PANEL FOR REORGVS

 09/12/2008 - V01.01.08

            - UPDATED REXX EXECS TO ADD THE FOLLOWING USER
              TAILORING COMMENT:
              1) CHANGE THE LENGTH OF "SYSID" TO YOUR SPECIFICATION.
                   THE DEFAULT IS 3 CHARACTERS IF THIS IS NOT
                   MODIFIED.
            - ALSO UPDATED REXX EXEC "REORGVS5" TO ADD THE ADDITIONAL
              TAILORING COMMENT:
              2) CHANGE THE HLQ OF THE LOG DATASET TO YOUR
                   SPECIFICATION.  THE DEFAULT HLQ IS "SYS3".

 09/27/2006 - V01.01.07

           - ADDED A REXX EXEC CALL BADVSAM WHICH IDENTIFIES VSAM
             COMPONENTS WHICH ARE DEFINED WITH THE "IMBED",
             "REPLICATE", AND "KEYRANGE" PARAMETERS.  CALLS PROGRAM
             'IGGCSI00' TO LOOK THROUGH EACH ICF CATALOG IMPORT
             CONNECTED TO THE MASTER CATALOG.

 08/28/2006 - V01.01.06

           - ADDED A MACRO CALLED "HOWCALLD" TO BE USED IN PROGRAMS
             "ABENDER" AND "WAITFOR". THE MACRO DETERMINES HOW THE
             PROGRAMS WERE CALLED BY THE CALLER.

 08/24/2006 - V01.01.05

           - FIXED A BUG IN REXX EXECS "REORGVS1", "REORGVS2",
             "REORGVS3" AND "REORGVS4".
             IF THERE ARE NO AIX ASSOCIATIONS WITH A CLUSTER, THE
             DDNAME AIXCMDS AND DEFINE WERE NOT BEING OPENED AND
             CAUSED A SUBSEQUENT FAILURE IN THE IDCAM STEPS
             WHICH WERE PROCESSING THESE FILES AS INPUT FILES.
             A "WRONG LENGTH RECORD" MESSAGE WOULD BE ISSUED
             DUE TO OF THE ABSENCE OF AN EOF (END OF FILE)
             INDICATOR IN THE INPUT DATASETS.

 05/24/2006 - V01.01.04

           - ELIMINATED THE "UNIQUE/SUBALLOCATION' KEYWORD PARMS
             ON THE DEFINE STATEMENTS FOR BOTH CLUSTERS AND
             ALTERNATE INDEXES.  THESE KEYWORD PARMS ARE NO LONGER
             COMPATABLE WITH ICF CATALOGS.  ALSO, THE UNIQUE"
             KEYWORD IS INCOMPATABLE WITH THE "REUSE" PARAMETER.

             IBM NOTE:
             "THE UNIQUE KEYWORD WHEN IT WAS ORIGINALLY IMPLEMENTED
             WAS INTENDED FOR USE WITH VSAM CATALOGS (THE
             PREDECESSORS TO ICF CATALOGS) TO FORCE THE DATA SET
             TO HAVE IT'S OWN ENTRY IN THE VTOC, RATHER THAN BEING
             ALLOCATED FROM A "VSAM SPACE".  WHEN ICF CATALOGS
             CAME ALONG EVERY VSAM DATA SET DEFINED IN AN ICF
             CATALOG HAS THE UNIQUE KEYWORD, REGARDLESS IF YOU
             SPECIFY IT OR NOT.  IT'S A REMNANT OF VSAM CATALOGS
             (IN WHICH SUPPORT WAS DROPPED IN OS/390 2.10 (AND
             THEY STOPPED FUNCTIONING IN EARLIER RELEASES ON
             SYSTEMS WITH A SYSTEM DATE LATER THAN JAN 1, 2000) IN
             SHORT UNIQUE AN OBSOLETE PARAMETER."



 02/23/2006 - V01.01.03

           - CHANGED EXEC "REORGVS5" TO SHOW THE LOGFILE DATSET NAME.

 02/16/2006 - V01.01.02

           - INCREASED THE FIELD SIZE OF ALL NUMERIC VALUES FROM
              FIVE DIGITS TO EIGHT DIGITS.

           - FIXED BUG WITH THE INDEX COMPONENT'S SECONDARY
              ALLOCATION UNITS. IT WAS USING THE SAME VALUE
              AS THE PRIMARY ALLOCATION UNITS.

           - ADDED THE FOLLOWING PARAMETERS TO THE CLUSTER
              DEFINITIONS AS EXPLICITLY STATED:

                 UNORDERED    / ORDERED
                 UNIQUE       / SUBALLOCATION
                 NOWRITECHECK / WRITECHECK
                 NOERASE      / ERASE

           - ADDED A "TEST" PARAMETER TO THE "REORGVS" EXEC
              TO ALLOW A TEST SIMULATION (WITH NO FILE UPDATES).
              (ALSO, DOES NOT DELETE THE WORK DATASETS SO THEY
               CAN BE ANALYZED).

                  %REORGVS  MY.CLUSTER   TEST

 01/31/2006 - V01.01.01

           - ADDED THE CAPABILITY OF INCREASING OR DECREASING
              THE CLUSTER'S DATA COMPONENT'S PRIMARY AND/OR
              SECONDARY SPACE ALLOCATION BY A SPECIFIED
              PERCENTAGE.  ADDED THE INVOCATION PARAMETERS:

                  PRI(+NNN)  [ OR PRI(-NNN) ]     AND
                  SEC(+NNN)  [ OR SEC(-NNN) ]

 01/26/2006 - V01.01.00

           - NEW FACILITY OFFERED ON CBT
