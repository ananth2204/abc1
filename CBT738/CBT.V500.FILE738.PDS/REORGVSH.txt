)F FUNCTION -

 REORGVS is a REXX facility which allows a user to reorganize VSAM
 clusters without having to know the specifics of the allocation
 parameters and components associated with the cluster.

 It was written to reallocate and reorg VSAM clusters which were
 defined with the "IMBED" and "REPLICAT" parameters which are no
 longer supported by Z/OS 1.5 and higher.  It was written with the
 express purpose of converting these VSAM clusters, but it is also
 very useful in reorganizing clusters.  The user does not need to
 know the file attributes of the cluster or of the associated
 components in order to reorg a cluster.

 The facility executes REXX execs and IDCAMS in a background job.
 The REXX facility issues IDCAMS commands to parse out the
 DEFINE parameters and creates IDCAMS commands to reallocate the
 VSAM components.

 The user enters the parms on ISPF panels if this exec is invoked
 in the Foreground.

 The reorg facility issues IDCAMS EXPORT and IMPORT FUNCTIONS to
 BACKUP/RELOAD the cluster data.

 Multiple clusters can be reorged at the same time.  The REXX
 facility uses a random number suffix for the JOBNAME of each
 reorg job that it submits through the internal reader to make
 each jobname unique.

 The facility handles clusters having alternate indexes and paths.

 The facility assumes that RACF is installed as the security product.
 If RACF IS NOT INSTALLED ON YOUR SITE, YOU WILL HAVE TO MODIFY REXX
 EXEC "REORGVS4" TO ISSUE THE EQUIVALENT STATEMENTS FOR YOUR SECURITY
 PRODUCT OR JUST REMOVE THE FOLLOWING STEPS FROM THE "REORGVSS"
 JCL SKELETON):

     GETRACF, CHK500, ABEND500, BLDRACF, CHK700, ABEND700,
     GENPROF, CHK750, ABEND750.

 You may choose to handle security profiles seperately after the fact.

)X SYNTAX  -
        REORGVS  clustername
                 (HLQ(hlq)    )
                 (PRI(+/-nnn) )
                 (SEC(+/-nnn) )
                 (TEST        )

  Required - clustername (the Vsam CLuster Component Dataset Name)
                         Must be the first parameter passed. It is
                         positional in nature.

  Defaults - HLQ(Userid) (Uses the submitters Userid for the HLQ
                            for allocating the work datasets.)
           - PRI(+0)     (Don't adjust the Data Component Primary
                            allocation units value on the reorg)
             SEC(+0)     (Don't adjust the Data Component Secondary
                            allocation units value on the reorg)

)O OPERANDS -

))clustername - The Vsam Cluster to be reorganized.  The dataset
                name does not need to be enclosed in tics
                (although it will accept the name enclosed in tics).
                This operand MUST be specified.  It cannot be
                omitted.

))PRI(+/-nnn) - The percentage adjustment to either increase or
                decrease the data component's primary space
                allocation.  The default is "PRI(+0)" (No Adjustment
                to the primary allocation) if the operand is
                omitted. This operand does not affect the index
                component's space allocation or anyt alternate
                index component's space allocation associated to
                the cluster. The PRImary adjustment value must
                contain either a "+" or "-" as the first character
                of the operand if specified.

                PRI(+10)  - Increase the primary allocation by a
                            factor of +10%.
                PRI(-25)  - Decrease the primary allocation by a
                            factor of -20%.

))SEC(+/-nnn) - The percentage adjustment to either increase or
                 decrease the data component's secondary space
                 allocation.  The default is "SEC(+0)" (No Adjustment
                 to the secondary allocation) if the operand is
                 omitted. This operand does not affect the index
                 component's space allocation or anyt alternate
                 index component's space allocation associated to
                 the cluster. The SECondary adjustment value must
                 contain either a "+" or "-" as the first character
                 of the operand if specified.

                 SEC(+10)  - Increase the secondary allocation by a
                             factor of +10%.
                 SEC(-20)  - Decrease the secondary allocation by a
                             factor of -20%.

))HLQ(hlq)    - Specifies the High-Level Qualifier to be used for
                allocating the work datasets.  The default HLQ
                is the submitter's userid if omitted.  All of the
                work datasets will be deleted at the end of the
                reorg job processing except the EXPORT image
                backup work dataset.  It is saved for future
                reference/backout purposes.

))TEST        - This parameter will cause a test simulation of the
                reorganization.  It will not update the VSAM cluster
                or affect it.  It will only generate the work files
                which can be inspected.  This is considered a TEST
                pass execution. Some of the jcl skeleton steps will
                NOT be executed.
