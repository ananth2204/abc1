* JOL (ANY VERSION SINCE 1975) HAS A POTENTIAL PROBLEM WITH
*    EXECUTION 'IF' STATEMENTS.
*
* THIS MANIFESTED ITSELF WITH THE RELEASE OF JOL40.
*
* TWO SYMTOMS SHOWED:
*    1.  IF MAXCC<8 SKIPPED ALL STEPS INCORRECTLY
*        UNDER CERTAIN CONDITIONS.
*    2.  AN IF STATEMENT PRODUCED AN EXECUTION ERROR MESSAGE.
*
*
* THE PROBLEM IS DUE TO AN INCORRECT RECORD LENGTH, AND LENGTH
*    FOR THE 'IF' STATEMENT STRING BEING SET UP.
*
* SOLUTION: SET THE CORRECT LENGTHS FOR THE RECORD.
