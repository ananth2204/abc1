*Change Proposals: These are requests for changes or additions to Jol.
*       Any User may submit a Change Proposal by forwarding details to
*       the above address. When a proposal is received, it will be
*       included in this listing and distributed to all users.
*
*       Should you have any comments on existing change proposals,
*       please make your comments known by forwarding details
*       because a better product is easiet to develop after receiveing
*       your input.
*
*       Change Proposals may be handled in either of two ways:-
*
*       1. If the proposal is considered beneficial and it can be
*          provided by a SUPERZAP fix that is not overly cumbersome,
*          then the proposal will be implemented.
*       2. If the proposal is considered beneficial but requires
*          Reassembly of Source, then it will be included in a future
*          Release.
*
*       All Change Proposals are submitted as requests only and
*       CCS-Jol Pty Ltd reserves the right to accept or reject
*       any Change Proposals. Acceptance of a Change Proposal does not
*       necessarily indicate that the request will be honored in the
*       next release of Jol.
*
*       Where a Change Proposal is rejected for a General Purpose
*       Change, it will be considered as a special Customer Fix.
*       Special Customer Fixes will be provided as SUPERZAP Fixesonly,
*       and all conditions that apply to Change Proposals apply to
*       Special Customer Fixes except that the time required
*       to provide the Fix will be a major consideration.
*
*       Where multilpe Users have differing opinions on a Change
*       Proposal, all opinions will be entered into the proposal and a
*       decision will be made on the overall opinion.
*
*       As Change Proposals or Special Customer Fixes are accepted
*       or rejected, the appropriate annotation will be made to the
*       entry concerned.
*
*
*Problem Descriptions: These entries reflect problems that have been
*       encountered. When a problem occurs you should :

*
*       2. Forward all details as soon as possible to the above address.
*          If the problem is urgent, use either the phone or telex.
*          If a telex is forwarded, please remember that the time taken
*          to resolve the problem is to a large degree dependant upon
*          a clear definition of the problem. In any case, a maintenance
*          report must be forwarded at the earliest convenient date.
*
*       When a problem is received, it will be serviced according to
*       the severity you specify. The fix, if one can be provided, will
*       be entered in this listing along with a description of the
*       problem and distributed to all users. If there is no fix for
*       the problem, an attempt will be made to provide a circumvention
*       which will also be described in this listing. If no fix or
*       circumvention is available this will be noted and depending
*       upon the severity of the problem, special action may be required
*
