*COMPANY   CCS
*NAME      CLARKE
*CHANGE PROPOSAL: PROVIDE A PROGRAM TO RUN UNDER VS1 AND MVS THAT
*    WILL READ CARDS DIRECTLY FROM THE CARD READER AND
*          1.  COPY JCL CARDS THROUGH TO THE SYSTEM JOB QUEUE
*          2.  IF JOL CARDS ARE FOUND, CALL JOL,THEN COPY THE
*              JCL TO THE SYSTEM JOBQUEUE.
*    THE INTENT OF THIS PROGRAM IS TO ELIMINATE THE 'DOUBLE RUN'
*    PHILOSOPHY. IDEALLY, JOL PROGRAMS SHOULD BE ABLE TO BE FED INTO
*    THE SYSTEM, RECOGNISED, AND COMPILED WITH THE RESULTANT JCL BEING
*    PASSED DIRECTLY TO THE READER INTERPRETER OR SPOOLING PROGRAM.
*    THUS THE COMPILE PHASE OF JOL WOULD BE TRANSPARENT TO THE USER
*    AND WOULD EFFECTIVELY BECOME A SYSTEM TASK.
*SOLUTION:THIS IS UNDER STUDY.
*
*SUMMARY:PROVIDE INTERFACE BETWEEN SYSTEM READER AND JOL.
*CHANGE COMPILE READER
