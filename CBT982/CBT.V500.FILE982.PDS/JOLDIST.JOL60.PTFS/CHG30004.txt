*NAME      CLARKE
*CHANGE PROPOSAL: ALTER THE MANNER IN WHICH LISTS ARE FORMED IN A
*    MACRO STATEMENT.
*      FOR EXAMPLE:- IN THE SORT COMMAND, ONE CODES
*              SORT ETC  FIELDS=( LIST );
*      WHEN %FIELDS IS EXAMINED, IT HAS THE '(' AND ')' AROUND THE
*      VALUE.
* ***      IF IS PROPOSED THAT THE '(' AND ')' NOT BE PLACED AROUND THE
*          VALUE.
* THIS WILL PROVIDE MUCH MORE FLEXABILITY, AND ALLOW USERS TO EXAMINE
*    EACH SUB-FIELD OF A PARAMETER.
* ALSO, STATEMENTS LIKE :- LINK * LOAD('DSNAME'); WILL THEN BE CAPABLE
*  OF BEING SUPPORTED.
*
* NOTE *** THIS MEANS THAT SORT,MERGE AND COPY MACROS WILL
* HAVE TO BE ALTERED.
* IF THERE ARE ANY USER WRITTEN COMMANDS RELYING ON THE
* PARENTHESES BEING PRESENT, THEY WOULD ALSO HAVE TO BE
* ALTERED.
*SUMMARY: CHANGE METHOD OF FORMING LISTS WITHIN MACRO.
*CHANGE MACRO PARAMETERS
