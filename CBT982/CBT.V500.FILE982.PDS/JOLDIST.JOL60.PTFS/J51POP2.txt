* PROBLEM: ON MVS, CLEARING THE SCREEN TAKES PLACE AT A
*          DIFFERENT TIME THAN ON F4/MSP.
*
*          THIS MEANS THAT POPUPS DO NOT OVERALY THE SCREEN
*          AS THEY SHOULD.
*
* SOLUTION: PART 2:
*
*          ALTER THE MVS CODE TO PUT THE CURSOR ON LINE 20 AFTER
*          A FULL SCREEN GET.
