A multi-function WTO program

INTRODUCTION

It is sometimes a requirement that certain steps of a job should not
execute without specific address spaces (ie subsystems) being
either active or not active in the system. WTOPROG is a utility
program that addresses these problems. In addition, it provides a
generalized facility for issuing WTOR messages to the system
console. WTOPROG has three options.

OPTION ONE

This option checks that the user-specified address spaces are
active in the system. If any address spaces are not active, a WTOR
message is issued to the system console awaiting an affirmative
reply from the operator - it is assumed that the operator will start
the required address space(s). If all address spaces are active, a
zero return code is set and the next step executes. The following
JCL needs to be inserted before the required step:

//ACTIVE   EXEC PGM=WTOPROG
//STEPLIB  DD   DSN=wtoprog.loadlib,DISP=SHR
//SYSPRINT DD   SYSOUT=*
//SYSUDUMP DD   SYSOUT=*
//MESSAGES DD   DSN=wtoprog.message,DISP=SHR
//PARMLIB  DD   DSN=wtoprog.parmlib,DISP=SHR

Refer to the dataset attributes definition below for the definitions
of the MESSAGES and PARMLIB datasets.

OPTION TWO

This option checks that the user-specified address spaces are not
active in the system. If any address spaces are found to be active, a
WTOR message is issued to the system console awaiting an
affirmative reply from the operator - it is assumed that the
operator will stop the required address space(s). If all address
spaces are inactive, a zero return code is set and the next step
executes. The following JCL needs to be inserted before the
required step:

//INACTIVE EXEC PGM=WTOPROG,PARM='M'
//STEPLIB  DD   DSN=wtoprog.loadlib,DISP=SHR
//SYSPRINT DD   SYSOUT=*
//SYSUDUMP DD   SYSOUT=*
//MESSAGES DD   DSN=wtoprog.message,DISP=SHR
//PARMLIB  DD   DSN=wtoprog.parmlib,DISP=SHR

OPTION THREE

This option is a generalized facility for issuing WTOR messages
to the system console and then waiting for an affirmative reply
from the operator - it is assumed that the operator has been
requested to perform a particular task. The following JCL is
required.

//INACTIVE EXEC PGM=WTOPROG,PARM='W'
//STEPLIB  DD   DSN=wtoprog.loadlib,DISP=SHR
//SYSPRINT DD   SYSOUT=*
//SYSUDUMP DD   SYSOUT=*
//MESSAGES DD   DSN=wtoprog.message,DISP=SHR

REQUIRED DATASETS AND THEIR ATTRIBUTES

MESSAGES DD card

This dataset contains the WTOR message. It must be a single
record, up to 100 characters in length, contained in a sequential
dataset or a member of a PDS.

PARMLIB DD card

This dataset contains the names of the address spaces that need to
be active or inactive in the system. Any number of records can be
specified in a sequential dataset or member in a PDS. Address
space names are specified in columns 1 to 8 of an 80-byte record
with trailing blanks.

RETURN CODES

WTOR will issue the following return codes:

0      Successful

12      PARM field error

16      No record in the MESSAGE dataset

20      Error issuing the WTOR message.

ABEND CODES

WTOR will issue the following abend codes:

001      Open error (MESSAGES dataset)

002      Open error (PARMLIB dataset).
