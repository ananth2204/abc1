Sending high priority messages under TSO

TSO users are able to send messages to the operator console via the TSO
SEND command.  The message appears at the console as a low priority
message.  It is not highlighted and is removed when space is required
for other messages.

The program SEND@ provides the ability, particularly for system
programmers, to send high priority messages to the console. They are
highlighted and do not disappear until deleted by the operator.

To run the SEND@ program:

     TSO SEND@
     ENTER MESSAGE FOR OPERATOR -

       then enter as many highlighted messages as you want.....

     BYE     (in column 1 - will exit the program)   or if not
                                                     in Session Manager
                                                     mode....
             then a null line will exit the program.

             Session Manager mode does not allow you to enter a
             completely null line.
