The original article by R F Perretta is reproduced in member
PRSMINFA.

It consists of an assembler program, which must be linkedited as
SETCODE AC(1) authorized, and it must be authorized in the TSO
AUTHCMD table (IKJTSOxx PARMLIB member), or use the techniques
to authorize commands, as described in CBT Files 185, and/or 797,
IKJEFTE2 table.  And a REXX exec to drive the program, plus
a panel library of ISPF panels.

And so the parts of this package are:

1.  An assembler program:  PRSMINFO    AC(1)     (a TSO command)
2.  A REXX exec:   PROCINFO    (you must change the panel library name)
3.  A set of ISPF panels       (you must TSO RECEIVE them from XMIT,
                                and make them accessible to ISPPLIB)
