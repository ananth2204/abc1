+
%Commit+processing takes the changes that have been made in the managed
+datasets and adds them to Git management.
+
+Commit allows for, and it is encouraged to provide, a short summary of the
+changes to be captured in the git log for historical tracking. The summary
+typically consists of up to a 50-character title, followed by up to 72
+character lines of explanation. This dialog allows up to 16 lines of text.
+
+If there is an issue or ticket number, it is suggested that it be included in
+the title (e.g. Ticket: title text).
+
+Cancel the%Commit+process by entering%F3+with an empty Commit Title.
+
+The%Import+command may be used to import text from a dataset into the
+commit prose. If entered without a dataset then the dataset is prompted.
