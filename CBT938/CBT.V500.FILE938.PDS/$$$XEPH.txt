Xephon Articles.....

Xephon had turned over the rights to all of its MVS articles to
Thomas Publishing around the year 2005, and Bob Thomas of Thomas
Publishing (in early 2008) turned over support and publication
rights for the published code to www.cbttape.org, for articles
published thru the year 2005.

Therefore we can (in good conscience) publish and use this Xephon
code on the CBT Tape collection.
