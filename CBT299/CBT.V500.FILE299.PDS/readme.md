                  SOME ADDITIONS TO TAPEMAP

 ADDED SUPPORT TO TAPEMAP:   11/28/88

    1.  IEBUPDTE UNLOADED PDS'ES WHOSE MEMBERS THEMSELVES,
         ARE IEBUPDTE INPUT STREAMS, WITH THE ./ STRINGS
         CONVERTED TO ><, ARE NOW DISPLAYABLE BY MEMBER
         NAME.  "REAL" PDS MEMBER NAMES ARE PRECEDED BY A-,
         C-, OR R- AS BEFORE.  "SUBORDINATE MEMBER NAMES"
         ARE PRECEDED WITH A>, C>, OR R> TO DISTINGUISH
         THEM FROM THE "REAL" MEMBER NAMES.

    2.  TAPEMAP SUPPORT FOR THE CBT TAPE HAS BEEN INSTALLED.
         MANY FILES ON THE CBT MVS MODS TAPE ARE IN THE
         "COMPRESSED IEBUPDTE" FORMAT.  THIS PROCESS USES A
         PROGRAM CALLED CBT973 (ITS ACTUAL NAME) TO DO DATA
         COMPRESSION, AFTER THE ORIGINAL FILE (A PDS) WAS
         UNLOADED BY IEBUPDTE.

        A FILE IN THE ABOVE FORMAT IS LABELED AS "CBT973"
         UNLOADED IN REPORT ONE OF THE TAPEMAP PROGRAM.
         IF THE ORIGINAL FILE HAD IEBUPDTE CONTROL CARDS,
         THE MEMBER NAMES ON THEM ARE DISPLAYED IN REPORT
         TWO, INCLUDING THE IMPROVEMENTS TO THE DISPLAY
         MENTIONED ABOVE.

        "EMPTY" FILES ON THE CBT MODS TAPE HAVE ONE RECORD
         IN CBT973 FORMAT.  IN ORDER TO DISTINGUISH WHICH
         FILES HAVE CONTENT, AND WHICH ARE JUST PLACEHOLDERS,
         THE DESIGNATION "CBTEMPTY" AS THE UNLOADER NAME,
         IS DISPLAYED IN REPORT ONE, TO SHOW AN "EMPTY FILE"
         ON THE CBT TAPE.  "PARM=INLINE" EXECUTION OF THE
         TAPEMAP PROGRAM REFLECTS THIS DISTINCTION ALSO.

        IT IS SUGGESTED TO "TAPEMAP" A CBT TAPE, SO YOU CAN
         SEE HOW NICELY THE CONTENTS ARE DISPLAYED.

    3.  A GLOBAL VARIABLE &LINEPPG WAS INSERTED SO YOU CAN
         DETERMINE THE NUMBER OF LINES BEFORE A PAGE EJECT.
         THIS WILL MAKE IT EASIER TO ADJUST THE REPORTS FOR
         THE PRINTERS YOU HAVE AVAILABLE.

 ADDED SUPPORT TO TAPEMAP:   12/15/88

    1.  IMPROVED SUPPORT FOR THE CBT TAPES TO:
          A.  SHOW DATE AND VERSION NUMBER OF THE DOCUMENTATION
                FILE.
          B.  FIXED BUG ON PARM=INLINE TO SHOW THE RESULT OF
                THE LABEL FORMATTING FOR SL TAPES, AS WELL
                AS THE RESULT OF THE SCAN PROCESSING.
          C.  FLAGGED THE CBT TAPE DOCUMENTATION FILE ON
                PARM=INLINE PROCESSING.

    2.  TACKLED THE PROBLEM OF EXCEEDING THREE BASE REGISTERS.
          THIS WAS RELIEVED BECAUSE THE TAPEMAP PROGRAM HAS
          A LARGE NUMBER OF LITERALS IN IT.  SOME OF THESE
          WERE MOVED TO THE END OF THE PROGRAM AND ADDRESSED
          BY MEANS OF AN ADCON.  A DUPLICATION OF THESE LITERALS
          WAS PLACED IN THE ADDRESSABLE WORKAREA DSECT, WHICH
          USES R13.  AT THE BEGINNING OF PROGRAM EXECUTION, THE
          BLOCK OF LITERALS AT THE END OF THE PROGRAM IS MOVED
          INTO THE APPROPRIATE COPY SPACE IN THE GETMAINED
          WORKAREA.  THE PROGRAM GETS TO THE WORKAREA COPY
          THROUGHOUT THE REMAINDER OF ITS EXECUTION.

Subject: Changes I made to FILE299 Tapescan to prevent
         incorrect DENSITY error msg print
Date:  Thu, 10 Feb 2000 13:23:44 -0500
From:  John.Hallgren@equifax.com

Hi!

After testing it on our RS6000 tapes, I found that it was showing
the " **One or more files have density indicated incorrectly in
labels. All files are written at 1600 BPI" message when NOT
applicable or true!

Because, in code that Ron Tansky added in 1993, he set default
values in HDR2 to the "?" char as HDR2 is not found on these
tapes, which is fine.  BUT, then at EOF, the hardware true density
is compared to saved HDR2 value. This compare will ALWAYS fail due
to "?" and thus create the bad density message.  The code I have
added (and my modif tag line) addresses this problem.

I have tested this and it appeared to work correctly.  Not maybe
the best code, but it fixes the misleading message.
