Hi Sam,

I have created a new tool to use with SMP/E.
It is just a driver to use with GIMAPI (API) to generate new
reports from SMP/E database using to REXX language.

Using some variables as GIMCSI,GIMZONE,GIMENTRY,GIMSENTRY and
GIMFILTER we can select a lot of information and get the output
using OUTTRAP function. These variables will be available to
using RXGIMAPI.

I am sending a XMIT with a #INDEX and #DOC members.

Let me know if you have an additional comment.

Regards!

Daniel
