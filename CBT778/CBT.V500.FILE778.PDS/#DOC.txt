DEAR FRIENDS,

SOMETIMES WE NEED TO GENERATE REPORTS FROM SMP AND POST PROCESS THEIR
SYSOUTS.
SMP/E SINCE 3.2 HAS A GIMAPI MODULE, A API TO SOLVE THIS ISSUES BUT
JUST BAL, PL/I AND C PROGRAM CAN USE IT.
I CREATED A RXGIMAPI TO ABLE TO USE IN REXX PROGRAMS THROUGH REXX
VARIABLES.

VARIABLES :

GIMCSI='WWZ038.SR#2008A.IFA810.GLOBAL.CSI'
A CSI VSAM DATASET

GIMZONE='IFA810T'
A ZONE ENTRY, CAN BE : GLOBAL, ALLTZONES OR ALLDZONES
(SEE MANUAL TO MORE INSTRUCTIONS)

GIMENTRY='SYSMOD'
USED WITH GIMZONE
(SEE MANUAL TO MORE INSTRUCTIONS)

GIMSENTRY='*'
USED WITH GIMENTRY
(SEE MANUAL TO MORE INSTRUCTIONS)

GIMFILTER="FMID='HADG810'"
A FILTER TO RESULTS
(SEE MANUAL TO MORE INSTRUCTIONS)

LET ME KNOW IF YOU HAVE AN ADDITIONAL COMMENTS.
