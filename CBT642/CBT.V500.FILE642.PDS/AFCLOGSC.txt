//**********************************************************************
//*
//* SCAN Z/OS OPERLOG FOR TEXT STRINGS AND/OR MESSAGES
//*
//* PROC KEYWORDS:
//*
//*   FROM
//*     STARTING DATE/TIME FOR THE SCAN.  MUST BE IN THE FORMAT
//*     "'YYYY/JJJ,HH:HH'"
//*   TO
//*     ENDING DATE/TIME FOR THE SCAN.  MUST BE IN THE FORMAT
//*     "'YYYY/JJJ,HH:HH'"
//*
//*     YYYY IS 4-DIGIT YEAR
//*     JJJ  IS 3-DIGIT JULIAN DAY
//*     HH   IS 2-DIGIT HOUR
//*     MM   IS 2-DIGIT MINUTE
//*
//*     EXAMPLE:  '2002/212,14:35'
//*
//*   FROM AND TO ARE BOTH REQUIRED.  THE SHORTER THE TIME SPAN, THE
//*   FASTER THE JOB WILL RUN.
//*
//*
//* SYSIN PARAMETERS:
//*
//* JOBNAME=XXXXXXXX
//*   LIMIT THE SEARCH TO RECORDS PRODUCED BY THIS JOBNAME
//*
//* JOBID=JOBXXXXX
//*   LIMIT THE SEARCH TO RECORDS PRODUCED BY THIS JOBID
//*
//* JOBNAME AND JOBID ARE NOT GUARANTEED TO FIND EVERY MESSAGE
//* RELATED TO THE SPECIFIED JOBNAME AND/OR JOBID.
//*
//* SYSID=XXXXXXXX
//*   LIMIT THE SEARCH TO RECORDS PRODUCED FROM THIS SYSTEM (OR
//*   SYSTEMS - UP TO 16, EACH SPECIFIED ON A SEPARATE SYSID= CARDS).
//*
//* NOTE THAT THE FOLLOWING TEXT AND MSGID KEYWORDS REFER TO "SELECTED"
//* RECORDS.  THESE ARE RECORDS "SELECTED" BY ANY OF THE PRECEEDING
//* KEYWORDS.  IF NONE OF THESE ARE SPECIFIED, "SELECTED" BECOMES ALL
//* OPERLOG RECORDS IN THE JCL-CONTROLLED TIMESPAN.
//*
//* TEXT='TEXT YOU ARE LOOKING FOR'
//*
//*   THE FIRST CHARACTER AFTER THE "=" IS THE STRING DELIMITER AND IS
//*   REQUIRED.  THIS CAN BE ANY CHARACTER, BUT MUST BE MATCHED AT THE
//*   END.  MAXIMUM STRING LENGTH IS 127.  THE TEXT OF ALL SELECTED
//*   MESSAGES (INCLUDING MULTI RECORD) WILL BE SCANNED FOR THIS TEXT.
//*
//* MSGID='MSGID YOU ARE LOOKING FOR'
//*
//*   THE FIRST CHARACTER AFTER THE "=" IS THE STRING DELIMITER AND IS
//*   REQUIRED.  THIS CAN BE ANY CHARACTER, BUT MUST BE MATCHED AT THE
//*   END.  MAXIMUM STRING LENGTH IS 127.  ONLY THE FIRST 3 COLUMNS OF
//*   THE 1ST LINE OF EACH SELECTED MESSAGE WILL BE SCANNED FOR THIS
//*   TEXT, SO IT IS FASTER THAN THE TEXT= KEYWORD.
//*
//* FIND=EXCLUDE
//*
//*   ENTERED AS SHOWN.  THE RESULT OF THIS KEYWORD IS THAT IF ANY OF
//*   THE TEXT OR MSGIDS ARE FOUND, THE RECORD WILL NOT BE PRINTED.
//*   USE THIS TO PRINT EVERYTHING EXCEPT THE MATCHES.
//*
//* FIND=QUIT
//*
//*   ENTERED AS SHOWN.  USE THIS IF YOU ARE SCANNING THROUGH A LONG
//*   TIME SPAN FOR THE 1ST OCCURRANCE OF SOMETHING, AND DONT WANT TO
//*   WASTE THE TIME SEARCHING THROUGH THE REST OF THE LOG.  CAUSES
//*   EXECUTION TO END AFTER THE 1ST HIT.
//*
//* THE ORDER OF THE KEYWORDS DOES NOT MATTER.  A RECORD IS PRINTED IF
//* IT MATCHES ANY OF THE TEXT STRINGS AND THE JOBNAME, JOBID, AND/OR
//* SYSID CRITERIA (OR NOT PRINTED, IF "FIND=EXCLUDE").
//*
//* IF YOU JUST WANT TO PRINT OUT ALL THE LOG RECORDS IN A GIVEN
//* TIMESPAN, LEAVE OUT THE SYSIN PARAMETERS (OR ONLY INCLUDE COMMENTS).
//*
//* A "*" IN COLUMN 1 INDICATES A COMMENT RECORD
//*
//* RETURN CODES:
//*
//*   RC 8: DELIMITER ERROR ON A SYSIN STATEMENT.
//*   RC 1: NOTHING FOUND
//*   RC 0: NORMAL RETURN, WE FOUND AT LEAST ONE HIT
//*
//* EXAMPLE:
//*
//* //SCANLOG  EXEC AFCLOGSC,
