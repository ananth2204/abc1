Hi Sam.

After many years of using CBT tape programs, I finally have a
contribution of my own.  I wrote a program (AFCLOGR1) that scans
OPERLOG logstreams for specific text, msgids, etc.  and formats
the output in hardcopy SYSLOG format.  It has become quite handy
to me, and we use it in a number of different ways here.  Perhaps
others may find it useful too.

I packed it all up in an FB80 PDS and TSO XMIT'ed it per the
instructions, and am attaching it to this EMAIL as AFCLOGR1.XMIT.
The original PDS was named TRLH.AFCLOGR1.SRC, and was LRECL=80,
RECFM=FB, BLKSIZE=27920.  I included documentation, JCL, and the
local macros needed to assemble it.

If there is anything else you need, please let me know.
