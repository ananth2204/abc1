Hi Sam,

I've updated my Operlog scan program to correct a problem that it
had with very large operlog records.  It used to just abend; now
it handles as much of the record as it is given.

I've attached the full PDS (in TSO Transmit format) with the
source, documentation, macros, etc.

Happy holidays to you and yours!
