//***FILE 879 is from Tom Hall and contains a TSO command called    *   FILE 879
//*           TSOFIND, which first finds the cataloged instance     *   FILE 879
//*           of a dataset on your system.  And then optionally it  *   FILE 879
//*           can find all instances of that dataset on all online  *   FILE 879
//*           packs, and then it can also optionally display each   *   FILE 879
//*           one's DCB attributes.  Sometimes you will have an     *   FILE 879
//*           uncataloged copy of a dataset on the system with      *   FILE 879
//*           the wrong DCB attributes.  This program will reveal   *   FILE 879
//*           that situation, and will help eliminate confusion.    *   FILE 879
//*                                                                 *   FILE 879
//*           This program was written a long time ago, and still   *   FILE 879
//*           works as is, on MVS 3.8 systems and such.  But it     *   FILE 879
//*           has been fixed for z/OS, and the z/OS version is      *   FILE 879
//*           in this file as member TSOFINDZ.  (Works              *   FILE 879
//*           beautifully!)  Sample assembly jobs are included.     *   FILE 879
