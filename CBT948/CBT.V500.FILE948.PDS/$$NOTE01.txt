Hi Sam ,

Please find attached a modified version of file948.xmi :

I renamed the IFCID program to IFCREADS because this program
provides a good example of using the READS (Read synchrone) from
DB2 IFC  (instrumentation facility component).  IFCID is too
much large because there is hundred of IFCID in DB2 (a sort of
subcomponent of SMF100 and 101 data)

I checked S110CSV.

I added S100CSV and S101CSV which are essential programs for a
DB2 sysprog :

S100CSV decodes the DB2 Statistics records.  It is a must use for
all DB2 system admins, as the name says, you have anything that
happened on your DB2 system in counters.

S101CSV decodes the DB2 Accounting records.  It is a must use for
all DB2 DBAs, it is  application oriented, you have anything that
happened to your program accessing DB2 in counters.

As far as i know, no one shares these two programs on the
Internet, so until now, if you want to access to these
informations, you have to pay to vendors (BMC, IBM, CA ...) or
you write it yourself and keep it secret.  I wrote these 2
programs to be vendor free, and also because vendors are always
behind IBM, so you know that you have this information in SMF,
but your vendor doesn't give it to you yet ....

See you soon,
Duc
