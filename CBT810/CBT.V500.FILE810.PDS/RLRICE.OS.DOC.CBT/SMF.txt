On Screen is designed to allow data to be custom formatted.

SMF records are one of the types of data On Screen "knows".

When browsing a file of SMF data, you can enter "FORMAT SMF" or
just "SMF" to have On Screen start formatting the SMF data a record
at a time.

On Screen does no checking to verify packed decimal or other types of
data are valid.  If the data is not valid SMF records, On Screen can
and probably will abend with 0C7, 0C4, etc.


Some SMF record types have more data than can be displayed on one
screen.  Use the LEFT and RIGHT scroll commands to display the
other screens for these record types.

You can return to BROWSE be entering "FORMAT" in the primary command.
