    If you're not an assembler programmer of if spending the time
    writing an exit or formatter isn't worth the trouble, you may
    still be able to get a customized display by using USERFMT.


        IF statements
          1-10       literal 'IF'
         10-19       starting position in data record
         20-29       length in data record
         30-39       data type
         40-49       condition (EQ, NE,
         50-59       data for compare


        FIELD statements
          1-10       literal 'FIELD'
         10-19       starting position in data record
         20-29       length in data record
         30-39       Data type
                      .. valid data types are:
                         BINARY
                         CHARACTER
                         HEADING
                         HEX
         40-49       row,column for displaying in dynamic area
         50-80       data displayed for HEADING fields



    IF statements may be 'nested'.  That is one IF can be
    dependant on another.

 1      FIELD
 2      FIELD
 3      IF ..............
 4      FIELD
 5      FIELD
 6      FIELD
 7      FIELD
 8      IF ..............
 9      FIELD
10      FIELD
11      ENDIF
12      FIELD
13      FIELD
14      ENDIF
15      FIELD
16      FIELD


     in the preceding example,
        The sequence numbers (1-16) are just to help in this
        explanation, they are not part of the format definition
        statements.

        The FIELDS on statements 1 and 2 will always be processed.

        The condition specified on the IF on statement 3 will always
        be tested.

        If the condition from the test on statement 3 is true
           the FIELDs on statements 4, 5, 6, and 7 will be processed
           The condition on statement 8 will be tested
           If the condition on statement 8 is true
              process the FIELDs on statements 9 and 10.
           If the condtion from the test on statement 8 was false
              skip to statement 12
           process the FIELDs on statments 12 and 13
        If the condition from the test on statement 3 is false
           skip to statement 15

        The FIELDs on statements 15 and 16 are always processed.





OS.USER1 is some data that can be used to demo a user format.
Start up OS:
