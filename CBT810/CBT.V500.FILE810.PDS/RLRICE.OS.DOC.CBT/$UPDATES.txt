Jan 2010   OS now displays storage.  Requires APF.
           OS now has a disassembler


Jan 2010   Corrected problem with ESD items
             . If there were multiple ENTRYs at the same displacement,
               one the first was being genrated.
           Corrected memory leak durin cleanup.
             . LABELs assigned to AREAs (not referenced labels)
               were not being FREEMAINed.
           OS has had a tester/user.
---->      Thank you to Jack Eubanks at Fed Ex.  He did multiple
           re-assemblies and tests and read dumps to help find/fix/add:
             . Assembly problem in OSAUTH fixed.
             . Added SWAREQ macro to convert JFCB tokens to addresses
             . forgot to remove logic bomb in DISOUT
             . bug in DISULIST.  return code 4 from assembler was
                  interpreted as error level rather than warning.
             . S0C1 in GENSS2 corrected
             . disassembler needs to handle data set names like SPF..
                  that is if not quoted, add user's user id as prefix.
                  The disassembler is handling data set names as if
                  they were quoted.
                  This change has still not been made.
             . ABEND at exit flag was in SESSION block
                  moved to OSCOMM
             . There was no default national language.  This caused
                  very strange behavior.  Changed to default to "US".
             . Replaced the OS REXX exec in the DOC library
                  It now allows you to omit the DSN= and M=
                  keywords if you use only 1 or 2 arguements.
             . probably others I don't recall...
