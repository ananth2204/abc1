.  Improve FIND/Locate

.  Add some support for graphics data?

.  Continue improving HELP

.  SCAN or FIND primary command on PDS(/E) member displays to allow
   users to search all members for a given character or hex string.

.  Add some RACF or other security mechinism to restrict use of
   certain functions.

.  Allow the directory data for PDSes or PDS/Es to be edited.  This is
   one of the functions that should be restricted.


.  Allow VTOCs to be updated?  (VERY dangerous and should be restricted)

.  Compute size of data set before creating the data space
   use size of data set to size the data space

.  add a "?+" or some other command (@ sign perhaps)
   This would bring up a list of previous commands as a selection list
   As is, the command recall (?) is one command at a time.
   If the command the user needs is 10, 12 or further back,
   it takes a lot of "?" <ENTER> iterations to get back to the command
