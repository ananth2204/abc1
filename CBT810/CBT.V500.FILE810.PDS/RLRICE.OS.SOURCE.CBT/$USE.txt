How do you use OS?

  enter "OS datasetname"

For example

   OS SOURCE

Since there were no keywords, OS will assume "SOURCE" is a
data set name.  Also, since the data set name was not "quoted",
OS will add the user's ID as the first level qualifier and
will read/display "userid.SOURCE".

Another example

   OS 'SYS1.PARMLIB'

Again there were no keyword parameters, so OS assumes "SYS1.PARMLIB"
is a data set name and will read/display a member list of SYS1.PARMLIB.

Another example

   OS DSN=MY.LIB M=PROGA START=20 RECORDS=50

Since the DSN is not "quoted", OS will prefix the DSN with the
user's ID.  Because a specific member is requested (the M= parameter),
OS will display member PROGA.  OS will start displaying the member
starting with the 20th record and will stop reading and displaying
after reading 50 records or reaching EOF.


Let's say you have some data that has been ftp'd from a Windows or
Unix workstation to your mainframe.

   OS 'SOME.ASCII.FILE'  ASCII

Here the data set name is "quoted", so the user's ID will not be
prefixed.  The 'ASCII' keyword tells OS to translate the characters
from ASCII to EBCDIC before displaying.  If you left off the 'ASCII'
keyword when starting OS, you can enter 'ASCII' as a command line
command.  That is you can enter
   OS 'SOME.ASCII.FILE'
and then enter 'ASCII' on the command line.



  OS VOL=vvvvvv VTOC
     or
  OS VTOC=vvvvvv

OS will read and display the VTOC of volume 'vvvvvv'
