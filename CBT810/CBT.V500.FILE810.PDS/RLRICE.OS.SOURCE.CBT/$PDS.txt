PDS(/E) directory display

How do you get a PDS display?
  When starting On Screen, specify the name of a PDS:
     "OS MY.SOURCE"


  Or if you are already viewing data with On Screen, enter "OS" on
  on the command line.  On Screen will prompt with a panel that lets
  you enter the name of a library.  Leave the member name blank.

  From a VTOC display.  ('s' or 'b' line command) on a PDS or PDS/E


  There are actually two PDS directory displays.  One for
  loadlibs, one for non-loadlibs.

  For loadlibs, the member name, TTR, size, AC, and amode/rmode
  are shown.

  For non-loadlibs, the member name and TTR are shown.  If PDS
  statistics are present, version and modification (VV.MM), size,
  initial size, date created, date and time last updated, and
  user that last updated the member are shown.
