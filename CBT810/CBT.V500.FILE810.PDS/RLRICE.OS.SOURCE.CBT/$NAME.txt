I decided to change the name of this utility from FM "File formatter"
to OS (On Screen).  Why the name change?  "File formatter" seemed to
imply that the utility was for formatting or initializing data sets.
That is NOT the utility's function.  On Screen's function is to
display data with customized formatting.
