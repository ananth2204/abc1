       allocate a PDS with about 15 tracks of 3390 space
       10 directory blocks
       RECFM=FB, LRECL=80, BLKSIZE=4000
  b    the LOADLIB
       allocate a PDS with about 15 tracks of 3390 space
       10 directory blocks
       RECFM=U, BLKSIZE=6144
       the library DOES NOT need to be APF authorized
  c    the LISTINGS library

Copy the FM and FM2 REXX EXECs to a library in your SYSPROC
Edit the DSNs for the FMFORMAT, FMOPTS and ISPPLIBs
  . these EXECs use TSOPLUS.  If you use TSOPLUS,
      edit the STEPLIBX DSNs.  If you do not use TSOPLUS,
      remove the STEPLIBX statements and add the LOADLIB to
      to a STEPLIB, ISPLLIB, system LNKLST, etc



OS should be ready to use
