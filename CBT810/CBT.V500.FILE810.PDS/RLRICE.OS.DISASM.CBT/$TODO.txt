Allow user data areas to be sorted

Over-ride the DD names used by the assembler.
Other utilities may need SYSIN, SYSPRINT, SYSLIB, SYSPUNCH



add a FIND and a select to the label display when adding a USING

Reverse the order of labels in DSECTs when adding a USING
. currently the order is high to low (displacement)
. change to low to high
. allow labels to be sorted by name?

Improve BASE register definitions
. If begin is blank.. default to zero
. if end is blank.. default to length of CSECT
. if referred disp is blank.. default to zero


Generate a "COPY REGEQU" or the register equates immediately
before the END statement?

How to generate code for the areas referenced in the "pre assembled"
dsects (data sets supplied via option K)

at times it disassembles 1 byte too much

Add more opcodes

Allow object text files to be disassembled

Change processing of DSNs (SYSLIBs, pre-processed macro KSDSes,
  output data set) so they work like SPF.  That is if not quoted,
  dd the user's TSO ID as a prefix.
