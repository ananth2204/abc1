Each PDS, sequential file, or PDS member "OS'd" is considered a
"session".

For example if you start OS by displaying the list of members in a
PDS(/E), the member list display itself is a "session".  If you browse
(with the S, B, or V line command or primary commands), the member
contents is a second "session".  You may display the list of "sessions"
you have started by entering "SESS" or "SESSION" as a primary command.


As of now there are three types of "sessions"
  1) List of data sets in a VTOC
  2) List of members in a PDS(/E)
  3) Display of a file or PDS(/E) member

The session display shows one line for each "session"

You may switch "sessions" by entering a non-blank in the line command
area.
