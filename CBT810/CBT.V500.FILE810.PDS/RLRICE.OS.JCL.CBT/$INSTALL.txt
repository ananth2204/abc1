The download/unload from the CBT site should give you:

      DISASM
      DOC
      FORMATS
      ISPPLIB
      ISPTLIB
      JCL
      MACLIB
      OPTS
      SMF
      SMGR
      SOURCE
      STORAGE
      USERFMT


 1)   Edit all the jobs in the JCL library
      . add valid JOB cards
      . change the data set prefix

 2)   Run the ALLOC job.  This job allocates
      OBJECT
      LISTINGS
      LOADLIB

 3)   Run ASMDIS

 4)   Run ASMFMT

 5)   Run ASMOS

 6)   Run ASMSMF

 7)   Run ASMSMGR

 8)   Run ASMSTOR

 9)   Copy the OS and OS2 members from the DOC library
      to a library in your SYSPROC concatenation

10)   Edit the OS and OS2 members
      change the data set name prefix


      On Screen should be ready to use



If you want to use the disassembler
The disassembler allows you to save config info (data you enter
to tell the disassembler where data areas occur, which registers
are being used for program base registers, etc).

Config data sets are:
  PDS
  RECFM=FB
  LRECL=256

You may want to a config data set per user
You may want a config data set that is shared among users
You may want multiple config data sets per user (if you have code
  you have disassembled from multiple load libraries, you may want
  to have a config data set that you associate with each load lib)
Some combination of the above.

Member DEFCONF is a sample you can use to define a config data set.
