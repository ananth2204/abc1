Sam,

Please replace the Generic Tracker Facility Dialog with the
following replacement parts:

Invoking REXX EXEC:  GTZ
ISPF panel:  GTZPRINT
ISPF skeleton:  GTZPSKEL, JOBCARD
ISPF message:  GTZP00

Note that the z/OS logical not is represented as a PC SHIFT 6
(caret) due to EBCDIC to ASCII translation, our old nemesis.
It's most noticeable in the panel.  I have two new SAS programs
to replace the one I sent you earlier.  It is significantly
enhanced and corrected; it runs with SAS 9.2-9.4 with either JES2
or JES3 in a parallel sysplex WLM-managed scheduling environment
(tested on 18 LPARs).  The new version builds CSV files on z/OS
for subsequent upload to the workstation.  IBM offers nothing to
do this!  Keep posted.
