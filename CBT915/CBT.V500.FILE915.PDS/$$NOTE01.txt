Here is a simple new ISPF dialog that automates generation of the
JCL, JECL, and control card statements for the z/OS 2.1 Generic
Tracker Facility.   It will execute on any JES2 or JES3 on which
we have enabled the tracker for EAV exception reporting.

The dialog consists of the following:

    GTZ invoking REXX EXEC
    GTZPRINT panel
    GTZP00 message member
    Two skeletons:  JOBCARD and GTZPSKEL

To execute   e.g. from Dialog Test option 7.1 - simply type %GTZ
or from any command line   TSO %GTZ.  The JOBCARD fields may be
changed/modified at your discretion to add routing and print
post-execution processing.  These values are not saved in the
ISPF profile   they are stowed in the SHARED pool.  Once the PDF
editor window appears with the file tailored JCL, simply type
SUB, END or hit PF3 and the GTZPRINT job will be submitted.  To
terminate EDIT and return to the GTZPRINT home panel   seen below
  type CAN or CANCEL.  To terminate the entire dialog, simply hit
PF3.  The dialog uses a DO WHILE loop to redisplay the GTZPRINT
panel after each job is submitted.

Although over-ridden in the screen capture below, the defaults
from top-to-bottom are  Y Y N N".  The skeleton uses the
IBM-recommended BLKSIZE of 80.  I think it can be dropped once we
are RACF-authorized to GTZPRINT and can test it across our 18
subject LPARs.

My next objective is to create a series of SAS programs to digest
the GTZPRINT report into something meaningful and hopefully less
voluminous.
