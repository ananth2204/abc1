Short Help
----------

>>>  WARNING: This is a Beta version !!!     <<<
>>>  Do NOT use in a Production Sysplex !!!  <<<

Run the KSMMAIN exec (from the ISPF Command line: TSO KSMMAIN)
The following panel will appear

+---------------------------------------------------------------------+
I                             Sysplex Manager
I
I Type:   D   CDS Pol Cf Struc
I         -    -  -   -  -
I Action: L   List New Quit
I         -   -    -   -
I
+---------------------------------------------------------------------+

Using the Tab key and pressing the Send (Enter) key in the Type menu
you can choose the Sysplex Object Type you want to work with:
D - CDS   = Couple Datasets
P - Pol   = Policies
C - Cf    = Coupling Facilities
S - Struc = Structures

Using the Tab key and pressing the Send (Enter) key in the Action menu
you can choose the action you want to perform on the selected object
type:
L - List  = Show a list of the objects
N - New   = Create a new object (CoupleDS or Policy)
Q - Quit  = Quits the REXX exec

Tip: you can enter the underlined character to quickly select
a type or an action.

Pressing the Send (Enter) key another time will perform the selected
action. For example if you want to list the Structures you can
enter Type: S (Struc) and Action: L (List) and press a second time
the Send (Enter) key. The following panel will appear:

+---------------------------------------------------------------------+

A new menu (Item: ) will appear, followed by the list of the objects
selected.

Using the Return key and pressing the Send (Enter) key in the list of
objects you can select the object you want to work with.

As you can see also the Type and Action menus are changed.
Like before by changing Type and Action you can choose which action
to perform on the selected object.

For instance, in the Structures list, you could choose Type: N (CoNn)
and Action: L (List) to show a list of the Connections to that
Structure.

Note that if the list does not fit in the window the Point-and-Shoot
fields More and Less will appear next to the Item menu. Using the Tab
key you can move to More to go one Page Down and to Less to go one
Page Up. There is no PF Key equivalent (PF7 PF8 will not work).

Clearing the Type field character will reset the menu to the initial
status.

Reference:
----------
Actions:

A - Alter    = Alter the size of a structure
C - aCouple  = Add an Alternate CDS
D - Display  = Show the object details (D XCF)
F - Force    = Force a structure or a connection
I - Rebuild  = Rebuild a structure or a CF with LOCATION=OTHER
L - List     = List the objects
N - New      = Create a new object (CDS or Pol)
O - stOp     = Stop a policy
P - Populate = Perform a Rebuild with POPULATECF keyword
Q - Quit     = Quit the KSMMAIN Rexx Exec
R - Report   = Create a policy report
S - Start    = Start a policy
U - Unduplex = Stop Rebuild DUPLEX
W - PsWitch  = Use the Alternate CDS as Primary
X - DupleX   = Rebuild a structure with the DUPLEX keyword

Future plans:
-------------
- add support for xcf (PI,PO,TG,Cl)
- add support for system logger
- add pfkey for up and down
- provide an edit macro to cleanup policy reports
... and a lot of other ideas

(please help me if you know TSO/Rexx and ISPF !)
