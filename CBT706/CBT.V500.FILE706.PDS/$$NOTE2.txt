Hi Sam,

I've uploaded version 1.1 of file706.

This version:
1. Adds support for rotated labels on line charts
2. Upgrades the included Batik jar file to version 1.5.1
   (was using 1.5.1rc2)
3. Renames the ZIPFILE member to ZIPDOCS
4. Has Improved html documentation and tutorial stored in ZIPDOCS.

Cheers,
Andrew.
