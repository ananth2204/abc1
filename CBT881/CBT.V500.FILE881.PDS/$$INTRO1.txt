Short instructions on how to use this file.

This is our first foray into putting Microsoft Excel files on the
CBT Tape.  We simply FTP'ed them to FB-80 pds members, in binary,
with no further changes.

I tried FTP downloading them back to a PC, and looking at them with
Microsoft Excel, after renaming them on the PC appropriately:

     julianx.xls    and    systemj.xlsx
Seems to work OK.  You'll have to try them yourself.
