Sam,
Here is a copy of the Julian Calendar that I got from the CBT website
that has changes that I made.

It has two tables on the second sheet where someone can add their
own holidays and paydays (or whatever they want to call them).
The first sheet/calendar will then highlight those days for them.

If you wish, you may distribute it as per standard CBT policy.
I would also value your opinion on my changes.

Enjoy!
