Hello Sam,

While you are waiting, one of the things I added was sheet 2.
When you look at it, "unhide" columns B and G.

I wanted to make the calendar easy to maintain, so I designed it
so someone would just have to add the dates for the particular
category, and the spreadsheet would take care of the rest.

Columns B and G are the dates converted to EXCEL internal number
for the date.

Columns B and C are a table, and columns G and H are another table.
They are used in a VLOOKUP in the conditional formatting on sheet 1.

I also changed the conditional formatting for the cells on sheet 1.
I will have to pull it up to tell you exactly what.

Talk to you tomorrow,

Robert.
