//***FILE 492 is from Roland Schiradin and contains SHOWzOS         *   FILE 492

//*           SHOWMVS old boundary releases are:  6.30 and 7.10.    *   FILE 492
//*           Release 7.01 had dropped support for pre-OS/390       *   FILE 492
//*           systems, so if you have an older system, you should   *   FILE 492
//*           use SHOWMVS 6.30.  For current levels of z/OS, you    *   FILE 492
//*           should use SHOWzOS 8.01 or 7.25 which are the current *   FILE 492
//*           versions.  You should re-assemble SHOWzOS with your   *   FILE 492

//*           time.  Gilbert turned the maintenance of SHOWzOS      *   FILE 492
//*           over to Roland Schiradin a number of years before     *   FILE 492
//*           his passing.                                          *   FILE 492

//*           SHOWzOS 8.01 has been included here as members:       *   FILE 492

//*           Some shops might have trouble assembling SHOWzOS      *   FILE 492
//*           because it requires certain PTF levels of the HLASM   *   FILE 492
//*           Assembler program ASMA90.  If you can't assemble      *   FILE 492
//*           SHOWzOS yourself, we have supplied CBT File 614       *   FILE 492
//*           with many assembled load modules for different z/OS   *   FILE 492
//*           levels and SHOWzOS levels.  You can try these load    *   FILE 492
//*           modules and figure out which works best on your       *   FILE 492
//*           own system.                                           *   FILE 492

//*           If you REALLY NEED to assemble some of the previous   *   FILE 492
//*           versions of SHOWzOS, source is included here back to  *   FILE 492
//*           version 7.18, with the appropriate macro libraries    *   FILE 492
//*           and jobstreams.  These are clearly marked in their    *   FILE 492
//*           member names and ISPF statistics.  These are RECENT   *   FILE 492
//*           SHOWzOS releases.  Old releases are SHOWMVS, and      *   FILE 492
//*           SHOWM630, which can take you back all the way to      *   FILE 492
//*           ESA, if that is what you are running.  If you need    *   FILE 492
//*           source for any other SHOWzOS releases, please write   *   FILE 492
//*           to Sam Golob <sbgolob@cbttape.org>.  Just about all   *   FILE 492
//*           you'll ever need is also probably covered by the      *   FILE 492
//*           load module libraries in File 614.                    *   FILE 492

//*       SOME OF THE FOLLOWING REMARKS APPLY TO RUNNING SHOWzOS    *   FILE 492
//*       ON OLDER z/OS SYSTEMS (using previous SHOWzOS versions):  *   FILE 492
//*                                                                 *   FILE 492
//*           The system macro levels you are assembling with, are  *   FILE 492
//*           crucial if you are migrating from z/OS 1.8 to z/OS    *   FILE 492
//*           1.9 or higher.  So in File 614, the separately        *   FILE 492
//*           assembled load modules are marked accordingly, and    *   FILE 492
//*           you can tell which load modules were assembled on     *   FILE 492
//*           a z/OS 1.9 system or higher.                          *   FILE 492
//*                                                                 *   FILE 492
//*           SHOWzOS starting from version 7.16, and higher        *   FILE 492
//*           versions, including the current version which is      *   FILE 492
//*           7.25, requires having z/Architecture, and, at least,  *   FILE 492
//*           z/OS 1.3. (I also think SHOWzOS 7.17 had been tested  *   FILE 492
//*           to run with z/OS releases back to 1.4 or 1.5 - SBG.)  *   FILE 492
//*                                                                 *   FILE 492
//*           The most current version of SHOWzOS, version 8.01,    *   FILE 492
//*           uses many new machine instructions for the z-series   *   FILE 492
//*           machines.  You may (at this point) prefer to run      *   FILE 492
//*           version 7.25 if 8.01 doesn't run on your machine.     *   FILE 492
//*           The level of SHOWzOS that you run, should be consis-  *   FILE 492
//*           tent with the level of z/OS that you are running.     *   FILE 492
//*                                                                 *   FILE 492
//*           SHOWzOS may be invoked as an ISPF command, or from an *   FILE 492
//*           entry in the ISPF command table.  However, it should  *   FILE 492
//*           be invoked as a CMD instead of as a PGM.              *   FILE 492
//*           Like this -                                           *   FILE 492
//*                                                                 *   FILE 492
//*              SELECT CMD(SHOWZOS &ZPARM) MODE(FSCR)              *   FILE 492
//*                                                                 *   FILE 492
//*           If you don't invoke it this way from the ISPF         *   FILE 492
//*           command table, SHOWzOS may abend.                     *   FILE 492
//*                                                                 *   FILE 492
//*           For pre-assembled load modules at different z/OS      *   FILE 492
//*           levels, please see File 614.  Also see File 614       *   FILE 492
//*           for load modules of previous releases of SHOWzOS.     *   FILE 492
//*           You should use whatever load modules work best on     *   FILE 492
//*           your system, should you not be able to assemble       *   FILE 492
//*           SHOWzOS for yourself.  (Assembly requires certain     *   FILE 492
//*           release and PTF levels of the HLASM assembler         *   FILE 492

//*           You need a customized macro library to assemble       *   FILE 492

//*           SHOWzOS.  SHOWM630 contains the macros to assemble    *   FILE 492
