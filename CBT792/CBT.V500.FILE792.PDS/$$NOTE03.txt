All,

The PDS DISKMAP (CBT 792) issue of mapping all the DASD in my TSO
logon procedure turned out to be a bad parm I was passing.  I was
passing 'MAPONLY,VOLS'.  I looked at the source code and found
out that VOLS was a keyword parameter.  So 'MAPONLY,VOLS=1' just
maps the //VOLUME01 file.

There is a DISKMAP glitch that outputs an INVALID EXTENT message
because the high track number was greater than the number of
tracks on the volume (if there are alternate tracks on the
volume).  The total tracks (TRKSPVOL) variable
"(tot.cyls*trks.per.cyl)-alt.trks" calculation is wrong.  A
temporary fix was to comment out the test.

EXFMCONT DS    0H                                                  @LV
         SPACE 1
*        CLC   EXTHITT,TRKSPVOL    HI TRK > TRKS/VOL ?             @LV
*        BNL   MAPINVAL            YES, BRANCH TO MARK IT INVALID  @LV

Regards,
John K

Note from Sam Golob

   John K and I had a discussion about where to get the actual number
   of cylinders including the alternate, and we decided that the most
   accurate measure would be from +X'12' off the DCE for that UCB,
   as compared with +X'14' off the DCE.  Both of these are halfwords.
   The former quantity is the number of cylinders plus alternate,
   and the latter quantity is the highest addressable cylinder.

   And if it would be an EAV volume, then DCE+X'12' would contain
   the quantity X'FFFE', at which time you examine another DCE field
   at +X'34' for 4-bytes which contains the number of cylinders,
   plus alternate, and the corresponding 4-byte field at +x'38'
   which contains the highest addressable cylinder.

   The following information comes from the IECDDCE macro in
   SYS1.MODGEN:

DCEUDCYL DS    H   +X'12'              NUMBER OF DATA+ALT CYL
*                                      SET TO xFFFE FOR DEVICES WITH
*                                      MORE THAN 65,520 CYLINDERS. SEE
*                                      DCEUDCY FOR RELOCATED VALUE @LvC
DCEHICYL DS    H   +X'14'              HI SEEK ADDRESS
*                                      SET TO xFFFE FOR DEVICES WITH
*                                      MORE THAN 65,520 CYLINDERS. SEE
*                                      DCEHICY FOR RELOCATED VALUE @LvC

DCEUDCY  DS    CL4   +X'34'            NUMBER OF DATA+ALT CYL
DCEHICY  DS    CL4   +X'38'            HI SEEK ADDRESS

   We have not yet fixed DISKMAP this way.

   This was done, and the previous copy of DISKMAP on File 792
   was relabeled as member DISKMAP1.
