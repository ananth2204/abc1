Sam,

Here are the source, ISPPLIB, and ISPMLIB for the new functions I
added to our SDF.  The source code presented here is for SDF 3.4.

Again we use SDF 2.9.  I have no way to test SDF 3.4.

Anyone that wants to try this will need to update their assembly
and link jobs.  The MAIN line program changes quite a bit from 2.9
to 3.4.  I'm not too sure that update I made to SDFMAIN is all
that is required for SDFMAIN or not.

I added "A" and "E" as primary options, so I updated our primary
menu SPF panel.  The new ACT and ENQ functions use new ISPF
panels.  I think I have included all the new panels in the
"sdfplib".  There were some new messages, so there is one new
member in the SDFMLIB.

Richard
