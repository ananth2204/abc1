 This is a small system to control
 the transfer of programs from Development into
 Production Environment.
 The idea behind it is to give the head of section
 (whom approves the transfers) the comfort of doing
  it from their email client inbox, without forms
 and without needing to log into the mainframe.

 The process starts when a REXX routine creates
 a transfer request into a file. Later, a program
 named MAILSEND is called to build an email
 and send it to the SMTP daemon server, which
 sends it to the Microsoft exchange server.
 Once the user receives the email he either
  Approve  or  Reject  the program transfer
 and sends it back to the mainframe.

 The email arrives at the mainframe and is received
 by a program named MAILRECV which is started
 at every 5 minutes (via STC).
 The program issue a  receive  to read the email
 and to process a message files which comes
 as an attachment of the email (file POSTDATA.ATT).

 Once this message is decoded it calls another REXX program
 which updates a file with the pending transfer requests and
 also calls others processes to make the transfer.
