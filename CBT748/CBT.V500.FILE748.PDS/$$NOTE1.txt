Jose - thank you for sharing - I'm copying Sam Golob (the
maintainer of the CBT collection) as that would be the best
place to share your code. I do appreciate your sharing.

Dear Mr. Lionel B. Dyck,

I am sending some programs we have developed locally
which I would like to share with the community.

Actually, the assembler program was made following the
same model which I got from the programs from you and
Mr. Leland. I mean, without your sources I wasn't
able to code it.

The programs are two versions of a routine to perform
BASE64 Decoding; one in assembler and another one in
REXX. The files are like that:

1. decode_asm.txt - Assembler version for the Decode
   64 routine

2. decodex1.txt, decodex4.txt, decodex9.txt - sample
   REXX programs showing how to call the assembler
   routine

3. decode_rexx.txt - REXX version for the same routine
   with the example on how to call the routine at the
   beginning followed by the routine itself.

I have done the first version in Assembler and it had
worked fine for quite some time. However, another
programmer alerts me for the fact the routine might
have a bug and I have decided to convert it to REXX
(which solve the problem).

 (Note.  This problem has since been fixed!  Please disregard
         these comments about the Assembler version, which now
         works well--the same as the REXX version.)

I thought it might be good idea to share both programs
with the community and maybe somebody will find an
explanation for it. Nevertheless, the REXX version has
never presented any problem.

Again, I would like to thank you very much for your
time and for making so many tools available to the
Mainframe community.

All the best,

Jose Ferreira Neto
