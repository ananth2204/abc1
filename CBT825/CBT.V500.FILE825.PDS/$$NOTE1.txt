I have written a simple z/OS batch program to perform the first
few phases of SSL handshake and print the human readable output
into the SYSPRINT DDname. My intention is to write a simple
program to diagnose the most common SSL setup issues in z/OS.

Basically, the program is free to execute without any warranty.

The README file is extracted as following from the xmi PDS.

1. The SSLHAND program in JSSLHAND initiates Secure Socket Layer (SSL)
    session with the partner SSL server provided in the parameter by
    sending SSL client hello message.  The server will respond with
    SSL server hello message containing server certificate and
    optionally with Certificate request.  Following flow diagram is
    extracted from
    http://www.ietf.org/rfc/rfc2246.txt.

    -------------------------------------------------------------------
       Client                                       Server

       ClientHello                  -------->
                                                       ServerHello
                                                      Certificate*
                                                ServerKeyExchange*
                                               CertificateRequest*
                                    <--------      ServerHelloDone
       ::::::::::
    ------------------------------------------------------------------

    The SSLHAND program then formats the content supplied in
    Certificate and CertificateRequest and prints the output to
    SYSPRINT DD.  The public certificates found in the Certificate
    command will print to the SYSPRINT DD in Base64-encoded format for
    easy transportation.  Finally, the SSLHAND program returns and let
    the TCPIP stack in z/OS to close the TCP/IP socket.

2. Program SSLHAND is developed and verified in z/OS v1.6 environment.
    Standard z/OS TCPIP API socket call, DFHSMS macros (OPEN, CLOSE,
    XLATE) are used.  Although the program uses AMODE 24 and RMODE 24,
    ESA/390 machine instructions are used.  This program does not
    require any external SSL library e.g. IBM z/OS System SSL
    (GSKSSL).  Only IPv4 is supported.

 3. To execute the SSLHAND program, you can refer to the JSSLHAND
    member, amend the JOB and SYSTCPD DD card to suit your executing
    environment.  For SYSTCPD setting, you can refer to section
    'Selecting a Stack When Running Multiple Instances of TCP/IP' in
    z/OS IBM Communications Server: IP Configuration Guide.  The SSL
    server IP address and TCP port number are supplied as parameter to
    SSLHAND program in EXEC DD card in the following format:

                     PARM='IPv4addr(port_num)'
       For example,  PARM='123.45.67.89(1414)'

 4. This program is free to use via JSSLHAND member.  Feel free to
    send email message to sslhand@gmail.com for any comments.
