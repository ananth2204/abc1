HASPXEQ CODE\nMODIFICATIONS ARE REQUIRED IN ORDER TO INVOKE 4 EXITS (240-243) HOWEVER.\nIN ADDITION, TWO FIELDS MUST BE ADDED TO THE JCT.\n\nTHE MOD ALLOWS A USER TO INSERT A PROCLIB CONTROL STATEMENT IN A JOB, IN\nTHE FORM:\n         /*PROCLIB=ANY.DSNAME  ,VOLSER\nWHERE:\n         ANY.DSNAME IS THE DSNAME OF THE DESIRED PROCLIB VOLSER IS THE\n         VOLUME SERIAL NUMBER OF THE PROCLIB IF IT IS NOT CATALOGED.\n         NOTE: I RECOMMEND THAT YOU REQUIRE THE PROCLIB TO BE CATALOGED\n         AND REMOVE THE OPTIONAL VOLSER CODE.\n\nSTANDARD IBM EXIT 4 IS USED TO CAPTURE THE PROCLIB DSNAME AND OPTIONAL\nVOLSER AND STORE IN THE JCT.  NO OTHER FUNCTION IS PERFORMED AT HASPRDR\nTIME.

THE COPY STATEMENTS COPY MEMBERS\nTUC1081A, TUC1081B, TUC1081C, AND TUC1081D INTO HASPXEQ.  THESE MEMBERS\nSET THE ENVIRONMENT AND ISSUE THE $EXIT MACROS TO INVOKE EXITS 240 THRU\n243.\n\nMEMBER UPROCXIT CONTAINS EXITS 240 THRU 243.\n\n   EXIT240. THIS EXIT ESTABLISHES THE USER PROCLIB IF IT WAS SPECIFIED.\n   IT CLOSES THE OLD PROCLIB IF OPEN, DYNAMICALLY ALLOCATES THE\n   SPECIFIED USER PROCLIB, CONCATENATES IT BEFORE THE SPECIFIED\n   /*JOBPARM PROCLIB (OR DEFAULT), AND RETURNS TO HASPXEQ WITH A RETURN\n   CODE TO CAUSE HASPXEQ TO RE-OPEN THE PROCLIB.\n\n   EXIT241. IF THE SPECIFIED PROCLIB WAS ENQUEUED AND THUS COULD NOT BE\n   ALLOCATED, THIS EXIT PERFORMS THE FOLLOWING TASKS;\n            HOLDS THE JOB\n            RESCHEDULES THE JOB FOR CONVERSION\n            SETS AN AUTOMATIC OPERATOR COMMAND TO RELEASE THE JOB AFTER\n                  5 MINUTES\n\n   EXIT242. CLOSES AND UNALLOCATES THE USER PROCLIB.\n\n   EXIT243. CLOSES AND UNALLOCATES THE USER PROCLIB IN CASE\n   OF CONVERTER ABEND.\n\nANY DATASET MAY BE SPECIFIED AS THE USER PROCLIB. IF THE DATASET DOES\nNOT EXIST, THE CONVERTER PROCESSOR WILL INCLUDE THE NORMAL NUMBERED IBM\nERROR MESSAGES IN THE JOB CONSOLE LOG AND TERMINATE THE JOB.  THE\nBLOCKSIZE OF THE PROCLIB MUST BE 4240 OR LESS AS THE CODE IS\nDISTRIBUTED, BUT THIS IS EASILY MODIFIED IF DESIRED.  LRECL MUST BE 80.\nTHE CODE MAKES NO CHECK TO INSURE THAT A PDS HAS BEEN SPECIFIED, BUT THE\nCONVERTER DOES AND FLUSHES THE JOB WITH NUMBERED IBM MESSAGES IF SOME\nILLOGICAL SITUATION IS SPECIFIED.\n\nNOTE THAT SINCE THE CONVERTER RUNS AS A SUBTASK OF JES2, IT CAN ACCESS\nPROCLIBS THAT ARE EITHER PASSWORD OR RACF PROTECTED.  I BELIEVE THAT\nACF2 PROTECTION MAY BE CHECKED IF YOU DESIRE, BUT THIS CODE IS NOT\nPROVIDED.\n.pa\n.nf\n@FILE010@***********************************************************************\n*                                                                              *\n*         F I L E   1 0     L O C K H E E D   S P 2   M O D S                  *\n*                                                                              *\n********************************************************************************\n\n.ju left\nTHESE MODIFICATIONS ARE FROM LOCKHEED CALIFORNIA COMPANY (CL)\n\nTHE INSTALLATION CONTACT IS:\n\n JOHN KINN\n LOCKHEED CALIFORNIA COMPANY\n PLANT A-1, BLDG 67, DEPT 8321\n P.O.

The modifications are shipped on the tape in SMP\nformat.  All modifications apply to JES2 release SP1.3.0.\n\nLOC0043\n\nThis  update for  HASPSNA  provides  support for  SNA  printers (3287,\n7436, 3289) as JES2 remote printers.  Other SNA printers (3776,  8100)\ncan  be  used by  JES2  as  before applying  this change.  Developed by\nB&W Diesel, Copenhagen.\n\nLOC0042\n\nThis update for HASPSNA provides sharing of SNA printers between JES2\nand IMS or another similar VTAM application.  May be  applied jointly\nwith modification  LOC0043 or  without LOC0043.  Developed by\nCopenhagen Handelsbank, November 1980.\n\nLOC0058\n\nThis update for HASPCOMM enhances  the response to the operator command\n    $DU,RMTnnn\nwhen the actual remote is an SNA work station.  With this update, the\nSNA LUNAME  will be  displayed on  the console.   This information\nwill help  operators  diagnose  problems with  I/O errors etc.\n   If operators  are able  to alter  the LUNAME  (see LOC0059), this\nmod is  required to see the actual LUNAME  assigned to the remote.\nDeveloped by Copenhagen Handelsbank, March 1982.\n\nLOC0059\n\nThis update for HASPCOMM provides a new operand\n    N=luname\nin the operator command\n    $TRMTnnn\nwhich makes by operator able to alter the LUNAME of a SNA remote.  See\nsyntax rules in the actual code.\n\nNOTE:\nThis modification has been used to alter LUNAMEs, not to assign a\nLUNAME to a SNA remote  without LUNAME specified in JES2PARM.  If an\nempty LUNAME  is to be replaced, we suggest  you add this statement in\nthe SETLUNAM copy member after EX R15,LUNAMMVC:\n  OI  RATFLAGS,RATPILUN   LUNAME permanently assigned  KHB00645\nDeveloped by Copenhagen Handelsbank, March 1982.\n\nLOC0100\n\nTeamco, Norway has experienced a  problem with the present JES2 SNA\nsupport if 3270-type SNA printers are used on a JES2 system which  also\ncommunicates with  IBM  8100  og IBM  3970.   This problem was solved\nby Teamco using an additional JES2 modification which is also included\non the tape.\n\nNOTE:\n\nThe following comments contributed by Bill Mosteller (BCG). (03 AUG 83)\nThere may be problems with regular SNA RJE devices since some of them do\nnot request FM Headers in the bind, but do require them from JES2.\nPossible fixes are being worked on by a few sites, and will be included\nas soon as they are available.\n.nf\n.pa\n.nf\n@FILE028@***********************************************************************\n*                                                                              *\n*         F I L E   2 8    T U C C   N J H   M O D S                           *\n*                                                                              *\n********************************************************************************\n\n.ju left\n                        ABSTRACT\n\nTUCC NJE HEADER AND TRAILER USER SECTION EXTENSIONS.\n\nJIM WALKER\nTRIANGLE UNIVERSITIES COMPUTATION CENTER\nP.

These\nmodifications are for the JES2 component of MVS/SP 1.3.0 or MVS/SP 2.0.\n\n                            BSCCPU\n\nThe purpose of the BSCCPU modification is to reduce the processor\nutilization of data compression for multileaving BSC terminals.  This\nmodification is valuable only in a large installation running high\nspeed NJE or many active BSC terminals.  Processor utilization is\nreduced by using the TRT operation rather than a programmed loop to\nscan through blank character strings in the output streams generated by\nJES2 for NJE or for multileaving RJE workstations.  Based on rough\nmeasurements this modification will reduce processor utilization of\nthis segment of JES2 by about 8 to 10%.\n\n                            DFEXPAND\n\nThe purpose of the DFEXPAND modification is to make two alterations in\nthe output generated by the JES2 $DF command.  The first alteration is\nto eliminate the restriction that if a class count is greater than 99\nthe command will insert ** rather than the class count into the output\nmessage.  The second alteration is to place all class counts left\njustified within the output field.  For example, if the output from the\nstandard $DF command looks like this:\n\nOUT R=LOCAL   F=STD. C=***** T=***** W = (NONE)  CLASS B= 3,L= 2,M=**\nCLASS N=**,Y=11\n\nthen the new output will look like this:\n\nOUT R=LOCAL   F=STD. C=***** T=***** W = (NONE)  CLASS B=3,L=2,M=661\nCLASS N=787,Y=11\n.pa\n.nf\n@FILE034@***********************************************************************\n*                                                                              *\n*         F I L E   3 4    A N R   Q U E U E   F O R   1 3 3                   *\n*                                                                              *\n********************************************************************************\n\nThis file contains a version of the QUEUE command for SP 1.3.3.\n\nThe installation contact is:\n\n    Glenn Harper\n    American Natural Resources Production Company\n    5075 Westheimer   Suite 1000 East\n    Houston, Texas  77056\n    (713) 623-0300\n.pa\n.nf\n@FILE035@***********************************************************************\n*                                                                              *\n*         F I L E   3 5    K I M B E R L Y   C L A R K   M O D S               *\n*                                                                              *\n********************************************************************************\n\nTHIS DATASET CONTAINS THE SOURCE AND OBJECT CODE FOR 4 PROGRAMS:\n\n     X0202 - $TX     - JES2 EXITS USED AT KIMBERLY CLARK.

In addition to the display\nthe utility also validates the contents of the checkpoint data set.\n\nThe output display includes:\n\n- The contents of the HCT Checkpoint Area.\n\n- The contents of the QSE's.\n\n- The contents of the direct access checkpoint area.  In addition the\nutility calculates the number of track groups assigned to each volume\nand determines the number of \"bad\" track groups and the amount of space\nallocated to job on the volume.\n\n- The contents of the Checkpoint Information Elements.  Following the\ndisplay for each KIT the utility displays the checkpoint control bytes\nfor the checkpoint records associated with the KIT.\n\n- The contents of the remote signon table.\n\n- The contents of the first job queue element.  This job queue element\ncontains a message that contains the time, date and system id of the\nsystem performing the last JES2 cold start.\n\n- A summary of the number of active job queue entries and job output\nelements.\n\n- A listing of all currently active jobs in the system.\n\n- A detailed listing of the contents of the job queue.  Optional output\nincludes a summary of data from the JCT and allocation IOT's for each\njob, and a listing of the Job Output Elements assigned to the job.\n\n- A detailed listing of the contents of the Job Output Table, sorted by\nthe route code assigned to the Job Output Element.\n\n- A list of jobs that appear to have some sort of problem.\n\n- Two directories.  The first directory is sorted by job number and\ncontains the job number and output page on which the job queue data for\nthe job appears.  The second directory is sorted by job name and\ncontains the job name and the output page on which the job queu data for\nthe job appears.\n\n                    POTENTIAL APPLICATIONS\n\nThe applications for which the utility can be used include:\n\n- Validation of the contents of the primary and secondary JES2\ncheckpoints following a Kxx ABEND.  This validation may prevent\nunnecessary cold starts or all-system warm starts.\n\n- Validation of sections of the JES2 checkpoint that are not formatted\nusing the JES2 command structure or which require multiple commands to\ncompletely format the output.  An example is the display of the remote\nsignon table, which cannot be displayed using JES2 commands.\n\n- Obtain a display of the JES2 checkpoint parameters that are actually\nbeing used.\n\n- Obtain a display of jobs that have some sort of unusual condition.  If\nthe optional JCTLIST paramater is specified, this display also includes\nthe \"golden oldies\" and \"block buster\" jobs.\n\n- Determine the amount of SPOOL space that cannot be allocated because\nit is not in the free space map or any allocation map.\n\nThe output from the utility is intended to be displayed on a printer or\nby using TSO/SPF browse.\n.pa\n.nf\n@FILE038@***********************************************************************\n*                                                                              *\n*         F I L E   3 8    L O C K H E E D   S P 1 3 3 / 1 3 4   M O D S       *\n*                                                                              *\n********************************************************************************\n\n.ju left\nTHESE MODIFICATIONS ARE FROM LOCKHEED CALIFORNIA COMPANY (CL)\n\nTHE INSTALLATION CONTACT IS:\n\n  RICHARD PACE\n  LOCKHEED CALIFORNIA COMPANY\n  PLANT A-1, BLDG 67, DEPT 8321\n  P.O.

IF THE CATALOG IS\nUSED TO LOCATE THE DATA SETS, THE DATA SETS NEED NOT BE CATALOGED IN THE\nMASTER CATALOG AS THEY WOULD IF THEY WERE ALLOCATED VIA DD CARDS.\n\nMODIFICATION NAME EXIT10   (UPDATED 20 SEP 85)\n\nTHIS IS THE EXIT 10 MODULE RUNNING AT OUR INSTALLATION (ALMOST).  IT\nACCOMPLISHES THE FOLLOWING:\n\n      QUEUES MESSAGES DESTINED FOR REMOTES TO THE CPU\n      THAT THE REMOTE IS SIGNED ON TO.  THIS ELIMINATES\n      MESSAGE SPOOLING.\n\n      CAUSES ALL MESSAGES THAT EMANATE FROM THE JES2\n      ADDRESS SPACE THAT ARE OF INTEREST TO THE\n      REMOTE WORK STATION TO BE SENT TO THE REMOTE\n      AS WELL AS THE LOCAL CONSOLE.\n\nMODIFICATION GATEWAY           (UPDATED 18 APR 84)\n\nPROVIDE A MEANS TO HAVE TWO NETWORKS HAVE TOTAL NETMAIL COMMUNICATION\nBETWEEN THEM WITHOUT EITHER HAVING TO KNOW ALL THE OTHER'S NODE NAMES.\nTHE BASIC APPROACH IS THAT ONE NODE IN EACH NETWORK KNOW OF EACH OTHER,\nBUT NEITHER NEED KNOW ABOUT ANY OTHER NODES IN THE OPPOSITE NETWORK.  AS\nNETMAIL TYPE OUTPUT IS PRESENTED TO EXIT 13, THE RECEIVING NODE EXAMINES\nTHE USERID GATEWAY TABLE FOR A MATCH ON THE (POSSIBLY) PSEUDO USERID.\nIF FOUND, IT USES THE REROUTING INFORMATION TO CHANGE THE NODE NAME AND\nTHE USERID.\n\nMODIFICATION NAME GENTRACE     (ADDED 15 FEB 84)\n\nTHIS CODE, WHICH RESIDES IN A SEPARATE MODULE, SUPPORTS THE FORMATT\nING OF TRACE IDS 200 THRU 230.  THE INTERFACES TO ACCOMPLISH THIS ARE\nALL IBM SUPPORTED AND PROVIDED.\n\nMODIFICATION JESDUMP        (ADDED 20 MAR 84)\n\nTHIS IS THE VERSION WHICH WE HAVE MODIFIED TO WORK UNDER JES2 SP 1.     3.3.\n\nMODIFICATION OUTPUT         (ADDED   20 APR 84)\n\nTHIS MODIFICATION ESSENTIALLY REINSTATES THE GLOBAL OUTPUT INITALIZATION\nSTATEMENT DROPPED AFTER SP 1.3.0. THIS STATEMENT PROVIDES DEFAULT VALUES\nFOR ALL OF THE SUB-PARAMETERS PROVIDED WITH THE STATEMENT. THE STATE-\nMENT SUPPORTS ALL OF THE SAME FUNCTIONS AS THOSE SUPPORTED BY THE\n/*OUTPUT STATEMENT AND MOST OF THOSE SUPPORTED BY THE OUTPUT JCL\nSTATEMENT.\n\nMODIFICATION NAME SMF226    (UPDATED 9 APR 84)\n\nTHIS MODIFICATION CAUSES AN SMF 226 RECORD (ALMOST IDENTICAL TO THE TYPE\n26 RECORD) TO BE GENERATED WHENEVER A JOB HAS AN ERROR EITHER AT\nCONVERTER TIME OR INTERPRETER TIME.  THIS IS ESPECIALLY USEFUL FOR USERS\nOF APOLLO/STARS OR DCMS FROM VALUE COMPUTING INC.\n\nMODIFICATION SPOOLPAR       (ADDED 22 MAR 84)\n\nTHIS MODIFICATION IS A SAMPLE SPOOL PARTITIONING ALGORITHM.  IT IS\nIMPLEMENTED USING EXIT 11.  THE APPROACH IS TO DETERMINE HOW MANY ACTIVE\nSPOOL VOLUMES THERE ARE AND TO USE THAT NUMBER TO COMPUTE AN EXTENT\nNUMBER FOR A NEW JOB.  THAT JOB IS THEN RESTRICTED TO USING ONLY THAT\nEXTENT.  THE MAIN USEFULNESS OF THE MOD IS TO \"CUT YOUR LOSSES\" IF YOU\nLOSE AN ENTIRE SPOOL EXTENT.\n\nMODIFICATION STCPARM        (UPDATED 7 DEC 84)\n\nTHIS MODIFICATION PROVIDES THE INSTALLATION A MEANS BY WHICH AN OPERATOR\nOR SYSTEMS PROGRAMMER CAN PROVIDE JOB AND /*JOBPARM TYPE DATA FOR\nSTARTED TASKS.  THE INFORMATION THAT CAN BE PROVIDED IS:\n         (1) JOBNAME\n         (2) MSGCLASS\n         (3) PRINT ROUTE\n         (4) NOTIFY ID\n         (5) ROOM NUMBER\n         (6) JOB COPIES\n         (7) PROGRAMMER NAME\nNOTICE BY PROVIDING A JOB NAME THAT MATCHES A TIME SHARING USER ID ALONG\nWITH A MSGCLASS WHICH IS A \"HELD\" CLASS, THE TSO USER CAN EXAMINE THE\nOUTPUT FOR A STARTED TASK AT HIS TSO TERMINAL.\n\nTHE INFORMATION CAN BE PROVIDED TWO WAYS:\n    (1) BY SUPPLYING A SPECIAL DD CARD (DDNAME IS $$$$$$$$) WITH\n        NORMAL KEYWORDS WHICH ARE INTERPRETED BY THE JES2 TEXT EXIT.\n    (2) BY SUPPLYING SPECIAL KEYWORDS ON THE START COMMAND WHICH ARE\n        RECOGNIZED BY THE JES2 TEXT EXIT.\nTHIS MODIFICATION REQUIRES ABSOLUTELY NO MVS MODIFICATIONS AND ONLY\nTHE ADDITION OF ONE EXIT POINT IN JES2.\n\nMODIFICATION STCPURGE       (UPDATED 9 APR 84)\n\nTHIS MODIFICATION CAUSES STARTED TASK AND TSU JOBS TO BE\nAUTOMATICALLY PURGED IF THE JOB CREATED NOTHING OTHER THAN THE\nNORMAL SUB-SYSTEM DATA SETS.  THE IDEA IS TO USE A NORMAL SYSOUT\nCLASS (E.G. A) FOR THE STCMCLAS AND TSUMCLAS AND TO ONLY PRINT\nSTC'S AND TSU'S IF SOMETHING UNUSUAL HAPPENS.  CURRENTLY THE\nUNUSUAL THINGS ARE:\n    1. JCL ERROR\n    2. JOB ABEND\n    3. NON SUB-SYSTEM SYSOUT DATA SETS CREATED\n\nMODIFICATION TSOCMD         (UPDATED 9 APR 84)\n\nTHIS IS A RATHER STANDARD MODIFICATION TO ALLOW TSO USERS TO ISSUE JES2\nCOMMANDS AND TO RECEIVE THE RESPONSES BACK AT THEIR TERMINALS.  NOTICE\nTHAT THE RESPONSES ARE SENT BACK VIA TPUT, RATHER THAN SEND COMMANDS.\n\nMODIFICATION USERPROC       (ADDED 12 APR 84)\n\nHE ORIGIN OF THIS MODIFICATION WAS THE SHARE JES2 MODS APE. THE\nCONTRIBUTOR WAS JIM WALKER OF TUCC.  ADDED T LOCKHEED WAS THE ACF2\nVALIDATION AND THE USE OF THE SCAN FACILITY TO SCAN THE JECL STATEMENT.\nALSO ADDED AS THE USE OF EXITS EXCLUSIVELY RATHER THAN CODE ADDED O IBM\nMODULES. FINALLY A CALL TO IKJEFF18 FOR THE RROR MESSAGE GENERATION WAS\nADDED.\n\nMODIFICATION VTAMPRT        (UPDATED 29 MAR 85)\n\nTHIS MODIFICATION IS AN UPDATE AND ENHANCEMENT OF THE MODIFICATION\nORIGINALLY SUBMITTED TO THE JES2 SHARE MODS TAPE BY KNUD NIELSEN.  THE\nCODE HAS BEEN ENHANCED AS FOLLOWS:\n\n  (1) JES2 GENERATES A STREAM OF HASP094 MESSAGES IF AN ATTEMPT\n      IS MADE TO ESTABLISH A SESSION WITH A PRINTER WITH INTERVENTION\n      REQUIRED.  THE SOLUTION IS TO RECOGNIZE THIS FAILURE AND SIMPLY\n      RETRY THE NEXT AUTOLOGON CYCLE.\n  (2) JES2 HALTS A PRINTER WITH WHICH HE HAS ESTABLISHED A SESSION\n      (DCTSTOP IS TURNED ON) IF THE PRINTER HAS INTERVENTION\n      REQUIRED.  THE SOLUTION IS TO TURN OFF DCTSTOP AND $POST\n      THE OWNING PCE WHEN THE LUSTAT IS RECEIVED SAYINT THE PRINTER\n      IS NOW READY.\n  (3) AUTOLOGON IS LOST FOR REMOTES IF A SIMLOGON IS DONE\n      UNSUCCESSFULLY.  THE SOLUTION IS TO SUPPORT AN RPL WITH\n      THE SIMLOGON SPECIAL ACTION AND ONLY THEN TURN OFF AUTOLOGON.\n\nMODIFICATION XM$WTO         (ADDED 27 MAR 85)\n\nADD THE ABILITY TO SEND $WTO MESSAGES FROM ANY ADDRESS SPACE.  THIS\nPRIMARILY IS USED TO SEND MESSAGES TO RJE SITES FROM ADDRESS SPACES\nOTHER THAN THE JES2 ADDRESS SPACE.  THE TECHNIQUE USED IS TO HAVE A\nSUB-SYSTEM CALL AVAILABLE WHICH IS CALLED WITH THE ADDRESS OF A CMB.\nTHIS CODE IN TURN CROSS MEMORY POSTS A NEW PCE IN THE JES2 ADDRESS SPACE\nAFTER QUEUEING THE CMB.  THE NEW PCE PICKS UP ALL MESSAGES AND QUEUES\nTHEM FOR THE WTO SUB-TASK OR THE REMOTE CONSOLE PROCESSOR.\n.pa\n.nf\n@FILE039@***********************************************************************\n*                                                                              *\n*         F I L E   3 9    T U C C   N E T M O D S                             *\n*                                                                              *\n********************************************************************************\n\n          JIM WALKER\n          TRIANGLE UNIVERSITIES COMPUTATION CENTER\n          P.

EXIT10. VM MESSAGES HAVE BLANK TIME STAMP AND HASP MSGID.\n *        THIS EXIT COMPRESSES THE LEADING BLANKS, AND ADDS THE\n *        ORIGINATING NODE NAME TO THE INCOMING VM MESSAGE BEFORE\n *        IT IS SENT TO A TSO USER VIA THE SEND COMMAND. IT IS QUITE\n *        USEFUL IF YOU DEAL WITH MULTIPLE RSCS SYSTEMS THAT\n *        MAY SEND YOUR TSO USERS MESSAGES. ONE OF THE MORE\n *        IMPORTANT MESSAGES IS THAT A JOB HAS PRINTED ON THE\n *        VM SYSTEM. IN ADDITION, THE EXIT ACTUALLY ISSUES THE TPUT\n *        OF THE MESSAGE TO THE TSO USER. WITHOUT THIS FEATURE\n *        ALL MESSAGES ARE SENT VIA THE OPERATOR 'SEND' COMMAND\n *        WHICH IS QUITE EXPENSIVE.\n *\n *  2. TUC1370B. RSCS SETS BOTH THE CMBFLAGW (REMOTE) AND\n *        CMBFLAGT (USER) IN MESSAGES. JES2 TRIES TO SEND\n *        ALL MESSAGES WITH CMBFLAGW TO A REMOTE. THIS SIMPLE\n *        MOD CHECKS FOR BOTH BITS SET AND SENDS TO A USER IF\n *        THIS IS THE CASE. THESE 3 INSTRUCTIONS ARE REQUIRED\n *        TO GET RSCS MESSAGES BACK TO A TSO USER.\n *\n *  3.  TUC1380A. CONVERT VM PUNCH FILES TO TSO/E RECEIVE FILES.\n *        IF YOUR VM USERS STILL USE THE OLD PUNCH FORMAT, THIS\n *        MOD ALLOWS THESE FILES TO BE RECEIVED VIA THE RECEIVE\n *        COMMAND.\n *\n *  4.  TUC1390A. JES3 AND VAX SYSTEMS CAN NOT HANDLE NJE HEADER\n *        OR TRAILER RECORDS LONGER THAN 253 BYTES - IE THEY\n *        DON'T HANDLE SPANNED HEADERS. THE TUCC USER SECTION\n *        FOR BOTH HEADERS AND TRAILERS CAUSE THE TOTAL\n *        SIZE OF BOTH TO EXCEED THIS MAXIMUM.  THIS MOD REMOVES\n *        USER SECTIONS TO SELECTED NODES - IN OUR CASE ALL\n *        NODES GREATER THAN NODE20.\n *\n *  5.  EXIT005A. THIS IS A STANDALONE EXIT5 THAT PROCESSES ONE\n *        NEW COMMAND:  $UM,NODE,USER,'FROMUSER MSG'\n *        THE USER MSG COMMAND ($UM) SENDS A MESSAGE TO A USER\n *        AT ANOTHER NODE. ACCORDING TO RSCS STANDARDS, THE FIRST\n *        8 BYTES OF THE MESSAGE TEXT IS THE 'FROM USERID', SO\n *        IT IS A GOOD IDEA TO PLACE THE SENDING USERID IN THE\n *        FIRST 8 TEXT BYTES.\n *\n *        NOTE THAT A VCON WAS USED TO REFERENCE A SYMBOL IN\n *        HASPCON, SO THIS EXIT MUST BE LINKEDITED WITH THE\n *        HASJES20 MODULE.\n *\n *\n *  6.  VMSG. VMSG IS A SIMPLE TSO COMMAND WHICH ISSUES THE $UM\n *        COMMAND FOR A TSO USER. IT PLACES THE SENDERS USERID\n *        IN THE FIRST 8 TEXT BYTES OF THE MESSAGE AS DESCRIBED\n *        ABOVE. WITH VMSG AND EXIT005A INSTALLED, A TSO USER\n *        CAN SEND A MESSAGE TO A TSO USER OR A RSCS USER ON\n *        ANOTHER NODE.  THIS TECHNIQUE IS PARTICULARILY USEFUL\n *        IN SENDING REQUESTS TO THE BITSERVE DISCONNECTED VM\n *        MACHINE AT CUNY.\n.pa\n.nf\n@FILE040@***********************************************************************\n*                                                                              *\n*         F I L E   4 0    G A T X   X E R O X   9 7 0 0   M O D S             *\n*                                                                              *\n********************************************************************************\n\n     AUTHOR: NARM TCHUN, LEAD SYSTEMS PROGRAMMER,\n             GATX NETWORK SERVICES, GATX CORPORATION,\n             120 SOUTH RIVERSIDE PLAZA, CHICAGO, ILLINOIS 60606\n\n             PHONE:  (312) - 621 - 6514\n\n     DATE:   JULY 7, 1983\n\n     DESCRIPTIVE NAME:  XEROX 8700 / 9700 SUPPORT JES2 USER EXIT\n\n     RELATIONAL NAME:  USER EXIT1 UNDER MVS/SP 1.3.0\n\n     FUNCTION:   THIS EXIT PERFORMS THE FOLLOWING FUNCTIONS;\n\n         .

A Return    |\n   Code and an Error Information Code provide the primary    |\n   sources of diagnostic information.                        |\n - The entire Checkpoint data set may be read including the  |\n   Check record, Lock record, Master record, and 4K Queue    |\n   records.  Optionally, the reading of the 4K Queue records |\n   may be restricted to the JIX and JQE Queues.  The Check   |\n   record is always read first and the Master record is read |\n   last to allow detection of Checkpoint updates which may   |\n   have occurred while the Checkpoint was being read. If     |\n   this occurs, the Checkpoint data set will be re-read      |\n   until a valid copy is obtained or a specified number of   |\n   re-reads have been performed.                             |\n - The JESSPOOL routines can operate with missing SPOOL      |\n   volumes.  Normally, only the volumes marked as            |\n   \"selectable\" will be used.  However, at the user's        |\n   request, JESSPOOL will attempt to use all SPOOLs in       |\n   existence.  If this option is chosen, the user may also   |\n   request that Return Codes not be set when JESSPOOL is     |\n   unable to use a non-selectable volume.                    |\n - Dynamic Allocation is used; no DD statements are required.|\n - Any Count-Key-Data type direct access device is supported.|\n - If for some reason, a problem developed with the check-   |\n   point or SPOOL volumes and the names of the SPOOL volumes |\n   were CLIPped, the user could specify the first five       |\n   characters of the renamed SPOOL volumes and use these     |\n   routines as part of a postmortem or recovery program.     |\n - The JESSPOOOL entry points are:                           |\n     JESSPOOL- Builds the JESDATA area mapped by the JESDATA |\n               macro and is used to communicate between the  |\n               caller and the JESSPOOL entry points.         |\n     JESALOC - Allocates the JES2 Checkpoint and SPOOL data  |\n               sets and performs the first read of the JES2  |\n               Checkpoint data set.                          |\n     JESFREE - Releases all resources held by the JESSPOOL   |\n               routines.                                     |\n     JESCKPT - Reads the JES2 Checkpoint data set.           |\n     JESREAD - Reads a record from the JES2 SPOOL.           |\n     JESRJCT - Reads a JCT from the JES2 SPOOL.              |\nNotes:                                                       |\n   (1) A value of less than one second for the &MINHOLD JES2 |\n       Initialization Parameter may have an adverse effect   |\n       on JESSPOOL performance when reading the Checkpoint.  |\n       Please call me if you experience this problem.        |\n   (2) You may wish to change the following constants in     |\n       the JESSPOOL module:                                  |\n          - Symbol DSNPRFX is used to initialize symbol      |\n            JDSNPRFX in the JESDATA area.  It contains the   |\n            DSNAME prefix for the JES2 Checkpoint and SPOOL  |\n            datasets.                                        |\n          - Symbol DFLTCKPT is used to initialize symbol     |\n            JCKVOL in the JESDATA area.  It contains the     |\n            volume serial number of the JES2 Checkpoint      |\n            dataset.  If the volume serial number is blank,  |\n            then the system catalog is used to locate the    |\n            JES2 Checkpoint dataset.                         |\n-------------------------------------------------------------+---------\nThe QPURGE program runs as as either a batch job or started  | QPURGE\ntask under MVS/JES2.  It purges jobs from the JES2 Job Queue |\nwhich have remained in the system for more than a specified  |\nnumber of days since the job began output processing, or if  |\nno output processor time stamp is available, the number of   |\ndays since the job ended execution.  The program can operate |\nin either TEST or CANCEL mode, the diference being whether   |\nor not the jobs are actually purged via subsystem cancel     |\nrequests.  An audit trail is provided in the form of WTO     |\nmessages which give the job number, jobname, and age of the  |\njob's output for each job which is purged.  The program      |\nincludes numerous validity checks and any problems are       |\nbrought to the operator's attention via WTO messages.        |\n-------------------------------------------------------------+---------\nTICKETS is the front-end of a program which reads the JES2   | TICKETS\nCheckpoint and SPOOL data sets using the JESSPOOL routines,  |\nand generates job setup tickets.  No system mods or          |\nsubsystem interfaces are required.  The tickets program uses |\nits own checkpoint data set to keep track of which jobs have |\nhad setup tickets produced.  Restart capabilities include    |\njob number ranges, time of day requests, and an automatic    |\nwarm start capability.  The TICKETS front-end can also be    |\nused to list the JES2 Log, the input JCL, the expanded JCL,  |\nand the system messages for a given job, started task, or    |\nTSO user.  The front-end does not format or print job setup  |\ntickets; this is done by the TIFSUB (Tickets Interface       |\nSUBroutine) or by routines called from TIFSUB.  The          |\ninterface consists of a single entry point which is used to  |\nreceive a 'Call Code' which identifies the remainder of the  |\nparameter list.  The TICKETS front-end uses return codes     |\nfrom the TIFSUB to direct futher processing.  The TIFSUB can |\nbe coded in either FORTRAN or assembler.  The 'Call Codes'   |\nindicate one of the following:                               |\n                                                             |\n  Initialization - Called once at the beginning of the run.  |\n  New Job - Called when processing begins for a new job      |\n    setup ticket.                                            |\n  Internal Text - Called once for each internal text record  |\n    for a job.  Spanned records are assembled into a single  |\n    record before calling TIFSUB.  An end-of-file call is    |\n    made after all internal text records for a job have been |\n    processed.                                               |\n  Input JCL - Called once for each input JCL record.  An     |\n    End-of-file call is made after the last JCL record has   |\n    been processed.                                          |\n  End of JOB - Called at the end of processing for a each    |\n    job setup ticket.                                        |\n  End of Run - Called after all job setup tickets for the    |\n    current run have been processed.                         |\n  Abort Job - Called to abort the processing of a job setup  |\n    ticket when an internal text or JCL buffer has an invalid|\n    job key, DSID, or is not formatted correctly. Processing |\n    resumes with the next job setup ticket.                  |\n                                                             |\nThe TIFSUB can request the following via return codes:       |\n  - Continue with normal processing.                         |\n  - Abort the current job setup ticket without comment.      |\n  - Abort the current job setup and flag the job in error.   |\n  - Request that no more calls be made for internal text     |\n    records for the current job setup ticket.                |\n  - Request that no more calls be made for input JCL records |\n    for the current job setup ticket.                        |\n  - Request the TICKETS front-end to take an ABEND Dump.     |\n                                                             |\nThe TICKETS front-end formats and presents error information |\nreturned from the JESSPOOL routines as well as providing a   |\nnumber of its own diagnostics.                               |\n-------------------------------------------------------------+---------\nTwo test versions of the TIFSUB routine (see TICKETS above)  | TIFSUBA\nare provided; one in assembler and the other in FORTRAN.     | TIFSUBF\n-------------------------------------------------------------+---------\nThe HASP Merge program and its documentation from the        | NIHPROSE\nNational Institute of Health (NIH) are included since        | HSPMERGE\nthe ONL JES2 mods are in NIH HASP Merge format.              |\n-------------------------------------------------------------+---------\nThis mod uses an exit 5 routine to replace the JES2 $A and   | ONL$AJHJ\n$H commands and an exit 252 routine with code supporting the | J2X$AJHJ\nHOLD function.  The $A and $H commands provide the following |\nfunction:                                                    |\n  (1) The $A command prevents RJE operators from releasing   |\n      SETUP jobs awaiting execution.  SETUP jobs are those   |\n      jobs which indicate TYPRUN=HOLD in the Class Attribute |\n      Table (CAT).                                           |\n  (2) The $A command will release jobs to run on a specific  |\n      system using a system ID operand which designates the  |\n      system on which a released job must execute.  The      |\n      integrity of the System Affinities for a job is        |\n      preserved and a warning will be issued if a job is     |\n      released which can not execute on any system in the    |\n      JES2 complex because of a resource conflict.           |\n      The Resource Facility mod defines $AJ-sid resources    |\n      which can only be set/reset by $A and $H commands.     |\n      The $AJ-sid resources are attached by the Resource     |\n      Facility during initialization (exit 24) and can not   |\n      be displayed or altered by $DR, $QA, $QD, $QN, or $QQ  |\n      commands.  $AJ-sid resource names do appear in HASP608 |\n      Job Information messages generated by commands such as |\n      $DJ or $DC.                                            |\n  (3) The $H command holds jobs and resets the $AJ-sid       |\n      resources using exit 252.                              |\n  (4) Exit 252 resets the $AJ-sid resources.  The exit is    |\n      called by the $H command sub-processor.  The ONL$EJCH  |\n      mod also calls this exit routine.                      |\nNote:  This mod uses exits 5 and 252.                        |\n-------------------------------------------------------------+---------\nEliminates the punching of blank cards at the end of punched | ONL$BCRD\ndata sets at selected remotes.                               | $BCRDMAC\n-------------------------------------------------------------+---------\nExpands the JQE and QSE control blocks.  A cold-start is     | ONL$BLKS\nrequired.  After that, mods which require the additional     |\nspace may be installed without futher cold-starts.           |\n-------------------------------------------------------------+---------\nThe ONL Automatic Job Classing Mod:                          | ONL$CLAS\n - Determine the system resources required for a job by      | $CLASMAC\n   examining installation defined accounting parameters and  | J2x$CLAS\n   the job's internal text, and based on those resource      |\n   requirements, compute a job class.                        |\n - Pass information about a job to SMF by storeing           |\n   information in the JMR User Identification field          |\n   (JCTUSEID).                                               |\nNote:  This mod uses exits 3, 6, 7, and 20.                  |\n-------------------------------------------------------------+---------\nThe $COMWORK macro has been expanded to include a 50 word    | ONL$COMW\nwork area for use by local mods in HASPCOMM and exit 5.      |\n-------------------------------------------------------------+---------\nThe $D'jobname command has been modified to allow a partial  | ONL$DN01\nJobname to be specified.                                     |\n-------------------------------------------------------------+---------\nThe $EJ command mod uses an exit 5 routine to perform the    | ONL$EJCH\nsame function as a $EJ-$HJ-$CJ command sequence.  If a job   | J2X$EJCH\nis not restartable across warm-starts because of JES2        |\ninitialization defaults or because RESTART=N was specified   |\non a JOBPARM control statement, then a message saying \"NOT   |\nRESTARTABLE AT USER'S REQUEST\" will be issued.  Also, if you |\ndisplay the job, the HASP608 Job Information message will    |\ninclude text saying \"NO-RESTART\".                            |\nNote:  This mod uses exits 5, 20, and 252.                   |\n------------------------------------------------------------ +---------\nSupport has been added to support a /*RELAY control          | ONL$HRLY\nstatement for transmitting unit record data sets.  The       | $HRLYMAC\n/*RELAY control statement's main advantage over TYPRUN=COPY  | J2X$HRLY\nis that it can transmit anything ... and without             |\nmodification.  All card images following the /*RELAY         |\nstatement are transmitted until an end-of-file is reached on |\nthe input device.  The code is modeled after TUC's RELAY mod |\nbut has been expanded in scope.  If any errors are found in  |\nthe /*RELAY statement, the illegal /*RELAY card image and    |\nassociated error messages will be printed at the default     |\ndestination for the input device.

Its purpose is to provide Exit 5 routines with many of | $SERVADD\nthe services available to command sub-processors within      |\nHASPCOMM.  In fact, this mod will allow some command sub-    |\nprocessors to be moved from HASPCOMM to Exit 5 routines with |\nlittle or no modification.  Other features include a $ESTAE  |\nenvironment created before Exit 5 is invoked.  In the event  |\nof a program check, the command being processed is discarded |\nand an error message is issued.  Another feature is a new    |\nexit point in the COFJMSG service routine in HASPCOMM.  The  |\nCOFJMSG routine is invoked by a $CFJMSG macro instruction    |\nand issues the HASP608 Job Information Message.  The new     |\nexit (Exit 254) allows the HASP608 message text to be        |\nchanged prior to issuing a $CWTO.  The exit may issue its    |\nown $CWTO's if additional message lines are needed.          |\nNote:  This mod uses exit 254.                               |\n-------------------------------------------------------------+---------\nThis mod adds a user field in the $SJB macro (Subsystem Job  | ONL$SJBD\nBlock DSECT).                                                |\n-------------------------------------------------------------+---------\nThe Time/Date Validation mod adds a user defined exit to     | ONL$TODV\nHASPIRDA.

This program is used to read a job's\nJCT from  spool and then  optionally purge  it.   The source  for this\nprogram, given below, is intended to be a base for you to build on.  I\nhave removed  the sections of code  that were dependent on  our system\nand you would probably want to insert  your own code in these postions\nanyhow.  The places to look at closely are marked '**NOTE**' in column\n1.   The first place to look is  in the SRB code (SMOOSRB).   The only\n**NOTE** there,  is to mark the place where you could change the logic\nof which  jobs are  looked at.    It is  written to  only look  at the\nHARDCPY  queue.    In the  main  program  (SMOO)  most  **NOTE**s  are\nsuggestions.    The  only  critical  one is  the  last  one  which  is\nimmediatly before  label 'PURGE'.    You should  develop some  code to\nchoose which jobs to purge and which  to not purge and branch to label\n'PURGE' or  'NOPURGE' respectively.    If you do  not insert  any code\nhere, then all jobs found by the SRB will be purged.  Both SMOOSRB and\nSMOO  should  be  linkedited  into either  a  LNKLIST  library  or  an\nauthorized STEPLIB library.  An example PROC is shown below:\n.nf\n\n      //*------ SMOO - TEST PROC ------\n      //SMOO    PROC CYL=30,CORE=MAX\n      //SMOO    EXEC PGM=SMOO,PERFORM=4\n      //OUTPUT   DD DSN=&&REPT,UNIT=SYSDA,SPACE=(TRK,(10,10)),\n      //            DISP=(NEW,PASS),DCB=(RECFM=F,LRECL=80,BLKSIZE=80)\n      //MESSAGES DD SYSOUT=A\n      //SYSUDUMP DD SYSOUT=A\n\nAny questions should be referred to : RAK at PSUVM on BITNET\n                                 or : Rex Knepp\n                                      122G Computer Building\n                                      University Park, PA  16802\n.pa\n.nf\n@FILE045@***********************************************************************\n*                                                                              *\n*         F I L E   4 5   L S U   E X I T   D R I V E R                        *\n*                                                                              *\n********************************************************************************\n\n    AUTHOR   BUTCH O'QUINN\n             SYSTEM NETWORK COMPUTER CENTER\n             LOUISIANA STATE UNIVERSITY\n             BATON ROUGE, LOUISIANA  70808\n\n    NAME     TESTEXIT\n\n    FUNCTION PROVIDE AN EXIT TESTER FOR JES2 EXITS  SO THAT THE\n             EXIT MAY BE DEBUGGED UNDER TEST CMD OF TSO.\n\n    NOTES  - INCLUDE YOUR EXITS AT LINKEDIT TIME.

EXIT10. VM MESSAGES HAVE BLANK TIME STAMP AND HASP MSGID.\n *        THIS EXIT COMPRESSES THE LEADING BLANKS, AND ADDS THE\n *        ORIGINATING NODE NAME TO THE INCOMING VM MESSAGE BEFORE\n *        IT IS SENT TO A TSO USER VIA THE SEND COMMAND. IT IS QUITE\n *        USEFUL IF YOU DEAL WITH MULTIPLE RSCS SYSTEMS THAT\n *        MAY SEND YOUR TSO USERS MESSAGES. ONE OF THE MORE\n *        IMPORTANT MESSAGES IS THAT A JOB HAS PRINTED ON THE\n *        VM SYSTEM. IN ADDITION, THE EXIT ACTUALLY ISSUES THE TPUT\n *        OF THE MESSAGE TO THE TSO USER. WITHOUT THIS FEATURE\n *        ALL MESSAGES ARE SENT VIA THE OPERATOR 'SEND' COMMAND\n *        WHICH IS QUITE EXPENSIVE.\n *\n *        RSCS SETS BOTH THE CMBFLAGW (REMOTE) AND\n *        CMBFLAGT (USER) BITS IN THE NMR MESSAGES.\n *        JES2 TRIES TO SEND ALL MESSAGES WITH CMDFLAGW\n *        SET TO A REMOTE. THERE IS CODE IN EXIT 10 TO\n *        DO THE TPUT EVEN IF THE REMOTE FLAG IS SET, SO\n *        THIS PART OF THE CODE IS NEEDED EVEN IF THE\n *        OTHER FEATURES ARE NOT DESIRED\n *\n *\n *  2.  TUC1380A. CONVERT VM PUNCH FILES TO TSO/E RECEIVE FILES.\n *        IF YOUR VM USERS STILL USE THE OLD PUNCH FORMAT, THIS\n *        MOD ALLOWS THESE FILES TO BE RECEIVED VIA THE RECEIVE\n *        COMMAND. NOTE THAT THE RECEIVE COMMAND WILL NOT LIKE\n *        THE FORMAT AND WILL RECEIVE INTO THE FILE:\n *               RECEIVE.INVALID.FILE\n *        WHICH IS NOT AS CONVENIENT AS NORMAL FILES, BUT DOES\n *        WORK.\n *\n *  3.  TUC1390A. JES3 AND VAX SYSTEMS CAN NOT HANDLE NJE HEADER\n *        OR TRAILER RECORDS LONGER THAN 253 BYTES - IE THEY\n *        DON'T HANDLE SPANNED HEADERS. THE TUCC USER SECTION\n *        FOR BOTH HEADERS AND TRAILERS CAUSE THE TOTAL\n *        SIZE OF BOTH TO EXCEED THIS MAXIMUM.  THIS MOD REMOVES\n *        USER SECTIONS TO SELECTED NODES - IN OUR CASE ALL\n *        NODES GREATER THAN NODE20.\n *\n *      TUC1390B PERFORMS THE SAME FUNCTION FOR INPUT JOBS.\n *\n *  4.  EXIT005A. THIS IS A STANDALONE EXIT5 THAT PROCESSES TWO\n *        NEW COMMANDS:  $UM,NODE,USER,'FROMUSER MSG'\n *                       $UC,NODE,FROMUSER,'COMMAND FOR OTHER SYSTEM'\n *        THE USER MSG COMMAND ($UM) SENDS A CONSOLE MESSAGE TO A USER\n *        AT ANOTHER NODE. ACCORDING TO RSCS STANDARDS, THE FIRST\n *        8 BYTES OF THE MESSAGE TEXT IS THE 'FROM USERID', SO\n *        IT IS A GOOD IDEA TO PLACE THE SENDING USERID IN THE\n *        FIRST 8 TEXT BYTES.\n *\n *        THE $UC COMMAND IS USED TO SEND COMMANDS FROM THE TSO\n *        SESSION AND GET THE RESPONSE BACK TO THE SESSION. IT\n *        IS SPECIFICALLY REQUIRED TO ISSUE COMMANDS TO VNET.\n *\n *        NOTE THAT A VCON WAS USED TO REFERENCE A SYMBOL IN\n *        HASPCON, SO THIS EXIT MUST BE LINKEDITED WITH THE\n *        HASJES20 MODULE.\n *\n *\n *  5.  VMSG. VMSG IS A SIMPLE TSO COMMAND WHICH ISSUES THE $UM\n *        COMMAND FOR A TSO USER. IT PLACES THE SENDERS USERID\n *        IN THE FIRST 8 TEXT BYTES OF THE MESSAGE AS DESCRIBED\n *        ABOVE. WITH VMSG AND EXIT005A INSTALLED, A TSO USER\n *        CAN SEND A MESSAGE TO A TSO USER OR A RSCS USER ON\n *        ANOTHER NODE.  THIS TECHNIQUE IS PARTICULARILY USEFUL\n *        IN SENDING REQUESTS TO THE BITSERVE DISCONNECTED VM\n *        MACHINE AT CUNY. NOTE THAT THE DEFAULT NODE/USERID IS\n *        BITSERVE AT CUNYVM. VMSG MUST BE LINKEDITED AUTHORIZED.\n *\n *  6.   VCMD. VCMD IS A SIMPLE TSO COMMAND WHICH ISSUES THE\n *        $UC COMMAND TO SEND A JES2 OR RSCS COMMAND TO ANOTHER\n *        NODE. THE RESPONSE TO THE COMMAND IS RETURNED TO THE\n *        TSO USER WHO ISSUED THE COMMAND. THIS COMMAND IS SPECIFICALLY\n *        REQUIRED TO ESTABLISH VNET VIRTUAL PATHS. VCMD MUST BE\n *        LINKEDITED AUTHORIZED\n.pa\n.nf\n@FILE050@***********************************************************************\n*                                                                              *\n*         F I L E   5 0   U B I   D O C U M E N T A T I O N   F O R   M O D S  *\n*                                                                              *\n********************************************************************************\n\n.ju left\n             Doron Shikmoni  - Systems   (P85025@BARILAN - BITnet).\n\n             Bar-Ilan University - Computer Center\n             Ramat-Gan\n             Israel\n\n     Bar-Ilan University  -  JES2 modifications and exits.\n     +++++++++++++++++++     ++++++++++++++++++++++++++++\n\n                             Current JES2 level: HJE2329  UZ68540\n                                                 (PUT 8401).\n\n    The Bar-Ilan modifications are packaged into 2 data sets (on the\nJESMODS tape, 2 IEBCOPY unloaded data sets):\n\n1.  SYS2.JES2MODS (JES2MODS on the tape).\n    This data set contains the following types of members:\n\n    U@xxxx - This is an IEBUPDTE control statememt stream, to update\n             a member in HASPSRC. For example, U@CNVT updates\n             HASPCNVT and U@$JCT updates $JCT. This updates contains\n             ALL the updates done to that member in Bar Ilan; each line\n             of updated source is identified with *xxxxx where xxxxx\n             is the modification name. Thus, to install a specific\n             mod, only cards marked with its name should be applied.\n             An effort has been made to keep mods as separated as\n             possible.\n\n    @xxxxxa - This is a copy code member. All modifications to JES2\n             source are made using COPY assembler statements, To\n             minimize code transition and repackaging problems.\n             \"xxxxx\" here is the modification ID, and \"a\" is a\n             letter / digit to identify the specific copy code member.\n\n    EX@aaaaa - This is an exit package module. Exits are packaged\n             together on a subject basis, rather than on the exit type.\n             Thus, for examples, several exit 4 routines can (and do)\n             exist in several modules. An exit cross reference will\n             be maintained in the $$EXITS member of JES2DOC.\n\n    Others -  These are members that have to be called by some other\n             name because of some restriction. For example, HASPXIT0\n             has to be called so because of JES2 restriction in\n             exit call time. Any added macro is another example.\n             A third example is macros and routines from external\n             sources of mods (SHARE etc.).\n\n2.  SYS2.JES2DOC (JES2DOC on the tape).\n    This data set contains the documentation required for the\n    modifications. The following members can be found:\n    $$DOC  - You are reading it.\n\n    $$MODS  - This is the modification index. It contains 3-4\n             lines of description for every JES2  modification\n             done (including and modification that is done solely\n             within exits, with no source updates).\n\n    $$EXITS - Contains an exits table, which can be used to locate\n             an exit within a module, and gives a brief description\n             of the exit's function.\n\n    xxxxx  - Where xxxxx is a modification ID - This is a detailed\n             and thorough description of a modification, including\n             source pieces changed, exits used, exit load mudules,\n             copy code members etc.\n\n       Any suggestions, comments, error correction and whatever\n    Will be gratefully accepted and reviewed by:\n\n            Doron Shikmoni  - Systems   (P85025@BARILAN - BITnet).\n            Bar-Ilan University - Computer Center\n            Ramat-Gan\n            Israel\n.pa\n.nf\n@FILE051@***********************************************************************\n*                                                                              *\n*         F I L E   5 1   U B I   M O D S   F O R   1 3 3                      *\n*                                                                              *\n********************************************************************************\n\n            Doron Shikmoni  - Systems\n            Bar-Ilan University - Computer Center\n            Ramat-Gan\n            Israel\n\n  Bar  Ilan  University  JES2 (HJE2329) Modification index\n                         Current JES2 level: see $$DOC.\n\n=======================================================================\nMOD        HITS          ABSTRACT\n=======================================================================\nACF314    HASPRDR        ACF2 3.1.5 installation.

The special thing about this mod\n          is that it has control over both JCL and dynamic allocation,\n          and thus is a complete solution for tape drive limiting.\n          The mod is used in conjunction with the tape drive system\n          introduced by the Bar Ilan mods.

The\n          huge advantage of this, of course, is the elimination\n          of i/o to the checkpoint; all JQE's are read from JES2\n          storage.

A Return    |\n   Code and an Error Information Code provide the primary    |\n   sources of diagnostic information.                        |\n - The entire Checkpoint data set may be read including the  |\n   Check record, Lock record, Master record, and 4K Queue    |\n   records.  Optionally, the reading of the 4K Queue records |\n   may be restricted to the JIX and JQE Queues.  The Check   |\n   record is always read first and the Master record is read |\n   last to allow detection of Checkpoint updates which may   |\n   have occurred while the Checkpoint was being read. If     |\n   this occurs, the Checkpoint data set will be re-read      |\n   until a valid copy is obtained or a specified number of   |\n   re-reads have been performed.                             |\n - The JESSPOOL routines can operate with missing SPOOL      |\n   volumes.  Normally, only the volumes marked as            |\n   \"selectable\" will be used.  However, at the user's        |\n   request, JESSPOOL will attempt to use all SPOOL's in      |\n   existence.  If this option is chosen, the user may also   |\n   request that Return Codes not be set when JESSPOOL is     |\n   unable to use a non-selectable volume.                    |\n - Dynamic Allocation is used; no DD statements are required.|\n - Any Count-Key-Data type direct access device is supported.|\n - If for some reason, a problem developed with the check-   |\n   point or SPOOL volumes and the names of the SPOOL volumes |\n   were CLIPped, the user could specify the first five       |\n   characters of the renamed SPOOL volumes and use these     |\n   routines as part of a postmortem or recovery program.     |\n - The JESSPOOL entry points are:                            |\n     JESSPOOL- Builds the JESDATA area mapped by the JESDATA |\n               macro and is used to communicate between the  |\n               caller and the JESSPOOL entry points.         |\n     JESALOC - Allocates the JES2 Checkpoint and SPOOL data  |\n               sets and performs the first read of the JES2  |\n               Checkpoint data set.                          |\n     JESFREE - Releases all resources held by the JESSPOOL   |\n               routines.                                     |\n     JESCKPT - Reads the JES2 Checkpoint data set.           |\n     JESREAD - Reads a record from the JES2 SPOOL.           |\n     JESRJCT - Reads a JCT from the JES2 SPOOL.              |\nNotes:                                                       |\n   (1) A value of less than one second for the &MINHOLD JES2 |\n       Initialization Parameter may have an adverse effect   |\n       on JESSPOOL performance when reading the Checkpoint.  |\n       Please call me if you experience this problem.        |\n   (2) You may wish to change the following constants in     |\n       the JESSPOOL module:                                  |\n          - Symbol DSNPRFX is used to initialize symbol      |\n            JDSNPRFX in the JESDATA area.  It contains the   |\n            DSNAME prefix for the JES2 Checkpoint and SPOOL  |\n            datasets.                                        |\n          - Symbol DFLTCKPT is used to initialize symbol     |\n            JCKVOL in the JESDATA area.  It contains the     |\n            volume serial number of the JES2 Checkpoint      |\n            dataset.  If the volume serial number is blank,  |\n            then the system catalog is used to locate the    |\n            JES2 Checkpoint dataset.                         |\n-------------------------------------------------------------+---------\nThe QPURGE program runs as as either a batch job or started  | QPURGE\ntask under MVS/JES2.  It purges jobs from the JES2 Job Queue |\nwhich have remained in the system for more than a specified  |\nnumber of days since the job began output processing, or if  |\nno output processor time stamp is available, the number of   |\ndays since the job ended execution.  The program can operate |\nin either TEST or CANCEL mode, the difference being whether  |\nor not the jobs are actually purged via subsystem cancel     |\nrequests.  An audit trail is provided in the form of WTO     |\nmessages which give the job number, jobname, and age of the  |\njob's output for each job which is purged.  The program      |\nincludes numerous validity checks and any problems are       |\nbrought to the operator's attention via WTO messages.        |\n-------------------------------------------------------------+---------\nTICKETS is the front-end of a program which reads the JES2   | TICKETS\nCheckpoint and SPOOL data sets using the JESSPOOL routines,  |\nand generates job setup tickets.  No system mods or          |\nsubsystem interfaces are required.  The tickets program uses |\nits own checkpoint data set to keep track of which jobs have |\nhad setup tickets produced.  Restart capabilities include    |\njob number ranges, time of day requests, and an automatic    |\nwarm start capability.  The TICKETS front-end can also be    |\nused to list the JES2 Log, the input JCL, the expanded JCL,  |\nand the system messages for a given job, started task, or    |\nTSO user.  The front-end does not format or print job setup  |\ntickets; this is done by the TIFSUB (Tickets Interface       |\nSUBroutine) or by routines called from TIFSUB.  The          |\ninterface consists of a single entry point which is used to  |\nreceive a 'Call Code' which identifies the remainder of the  |\nparameter list.  The TICKETS front-end uses return codes     |\nfrom the TIFSUB to direct further processing.  The TIFSUB can|\nbe coded in either FORTRAN or assembler.  The 'Call Codes'   |\nindicate one of the following:                               |\n                                                             |\n  Initialization - Called once at the beginning of the run.  |\n  New Job - Called when processing begins for a new job      |\n    setup ticket.                                            |\n  Internal Text - Called once for each internal text record  |\n    for a job.  Spanned records are assembled into a single  |\n    record before calling TIFSUB.

This program         |\ncontrols the selection and order of SYSLOG's by issuing $TO  |\ncommands thru an internal reader.  SYSLOG information is     |\nobtained by reading the JES2 CHECKPOINT and SPOOL datasets   |\nusing the JESSPOOL routines.                                 |\n-------------------------------------------------------------+---------\nThe UIDHIST program generates a histogram of the number of   | UIDHIST\njobs in the system per user ID.  This is done by using the   |\nJESSPOOL routines to read the JES2 CHECKPOINT dataset, using |\nthe checkpoint information to build a table of user ID's and |\njob count pairs, sorting the pairs by job count, and         |\ngenerating a printer plot histogram.                         |\n-------------------------------------------------------------+---------\nThe HASP Merge program and its documentation from the        | NIHPROSE\nNational Institute of Health (NIH) are included since        | HSPMERGE\nthe ONL JES2 mods are in NIH HASP Merge format.              |\n-------------------------------------------------------------+---------\nThis mod uses an EXIT5 routine to replace the JES2 $A and    | ONL$AJHJ\n$H commands and an EXIT252 routine with code supporting the  | J2X$AJHJ\nHOLD function.  The $A and $H commands provide the following |\nfunction:                                                    |\n                                                             |\n  (1) The $A command prevents RJE operators from releasing   |\n      SETUP jobs awaiting execution.

The integrity of the system affinities       |\n      for a job is preserved and a warning will be           |\n      issued if a job is released which cannot execute       |\n      on any system in the JES2 complex because of a         |\n      resource conflict.                                     |\n                                                             |\n      The resource facility mod defines $AJ-SID              |\n      resources which can only be set/reset by $A AND $H     |\n      commands.  The $AJ-SID resources are attached by       |\n      the resource facility during initialization (EXIT24)   |\n      and cannot be displayed or altered by $DR,             |\n      $QA, or $QD commands.  $AJ-SID resource names do       |\n      appear in HASP608 Job Information messages             |\n      generated by commands such as $DJ or $DC.              |\n                                                             |\n  (3) The $AJ command calls EXIT251 (See the ONL$EJCH        |\n      mod) to reset the \"RE-QUEUED\" resource.  This          |\n      resource is set when jobs are re-queued by the $EJ     |\n      command mod.  Operators can display re-queued jobs     |\n      and will see the RE-QUEUED resource name in            |\n      HASP608 Job Information messages.                      |\n                                                             |\n  (4) The $H command holds jobs and resets any $AJ-SID       |\n      resources using EXIT252.                               |\n                                                             |\n  (5) EXIT252 resets the $AJ-SID resources.  The exit        |\n      is called by the $H command sub-processor.  The        |\n      ONL$EJCH mod also calls this exit routine.             |\n                                                             |\nNote:  This mod uses EXIT5, EXIT251, and EXIT252.            |\n-------------------------------------------------------------+---------\nEliminates the punching of blank cards at the end of punched | ONL$BCRD\ndata sets at selected remotes.                               | ADD$BCRD\n-------------------------------------------------------------+---------\nExpands the JQE and QSE control blocks.

BOX 551\n BURBANK, CALIFORNIA 91520\n\n TELEPHONE (818) 847-7492\n\nMODIFICATIONS FOR JES2 RELEASE 2.1.5/1.3.6\n\nDATE OF LAST TRANSMISSION TO JES2 SHARE MODS TAPE: 21 OCT 1986\n\nMODIFICATION $TEXIT\n\nTHIS IS AN EXIT 5 MODULE WHICH WILL REQUIRE THAT ANY $T EXIT COMMAND\nWILL REQUIRE A P=XXXXXXXX KEYWORD.  THE XXXXXXXX WILL BE A 1 TO 8\nCHARACTER PASSWORD.  AFTER VERIFYING THE SUPPLIED VALUE, THE P=XXXXXXXX\nTEXT WILL BE REMOVED AND PROCESSING WILL RETURN TO NORMAL IBM CODE TO\nPROCESS.\n\nMODIFICATION NAME BSCTRACE\n\nIBM'S SUPPLIED LINE TRACE (TRACE ID 4) FORMATS ONLY THE BUFFER IN WHICH\nTHE IOB APPEARS.  THUS, ONLY INPUT TRAFFIC IS SEEN.  OUTPUT TRAFFIC IS\nPICKED UP FROM A DIFFERENT BUFFER.  THIS CHANGE WILL TRACE ALL DATA\nPOINTED TO BY READ OR WRITE CCW'S\n\nMODIFICATION NAME CES\n\nTHIS MODIFICATION TAKES CARE OF THE PERMANENTLY DISCONNECTED NODE\nPROBLEM.  REFER TO APAR OZ62754.  THE APPROACH TAKEN WITH THIS\nMODFICATION IS TO REMEMBER THE HIGH WATER MARK OF CES VALUES GENERATED\nBY THE NODE ON WHICH THE MODFICATION HAS BEEN PLACED.  ANY TIME A NEW\nCES IS GENERATED THE VALUE NORMALLY TAKEN IS THAT OF THE TOD CLOCK.\nHOWEVER, IF THAT VALUE IS LOWER THAN THAT OF THE HIGH WATER MARK, THE\nHIGH WATER MARK + 1 IS USED AND THE HIGH WATER MARK VALUE IS UPDATED.\n\nHODIFICATION NAME COMMXIT\n\nTHIS MODIFICATION PROVIDES EXIT 5 FROM HASPCOMM THE NECESSARY MACROS\nNEEDED TO DO MOST INSTALLATION COMMANDS.  SUPPORT IS PROVIDED FOR THE\nFOLLOWING COMMANDS:\n   $CFSEL\n   $CFCVB\n   $CFDCTL\n   $CFVQE\n\nMODIFICATION NAME DIRECTED\n\nTHIS MODIFICATION CAUSES ALL JES2 MODULES IDENTIFIED WITH TWO NEW VERBS\nTO BE LOADED INTO CSA AT JES2 INITIALIZATION TIME.  THE MODULES WILL BE\nFREEMAINED WHEN JES2 TERMINATES NORMALLY (I.E. $P JES2).\n\nMODIFICATION DUMPLOAD\n\nTHIS CODE MAKES DUMPERS AND LOADERS EXTREMELY EASY FOR OPERATORS TO USE\nON AN AD HOC BASIS.  INSTEAD OF REQUIRING THAT TAPE DATA SETS BE\nPRE-CATALOGED IN ORDER TO START A DUMPER, THE OUTPUT DATA SETS ARE\nDYNAMICALLY ALLOCATED USING A DISPOSITION OF (NEW,CATLG,DELETE).  NOTE\nTHAT IF YOU PREFER TO MIX MODES OF OPERATION BY HAVING SOME\nPRE-CATALOGED DATA SETS AND SOME AD HOC REQUIREMENTS, THAT THIS CODE\nSUPPORTS BOTH MODES.\n\nIN ADDITION THE TAPE DATA SETS READ BY LOADERS ARE AUTOMATICALLY\nUNCATALOGED WHEN THE LOAD PROCESS IS COMPLETE.\n\nMODIFICATION NAME DYNALLOC\n\nTHIS CODE SUPPORTS A NEW VERB IN THE HASP INITIALIZATION DECK, DYNALLOC.\nTHIS VERB IS USED TO SPECIFY THE PROCLIBS USED BY THE CONVERTER.  FROM 1\nTO 16 DATA SETS CAN BE SPECIFIED FOR EACH DDNAME.  IF THE CATALOG IS\nUSED TO LOCATE THE DATA SETS, THE DATA SETS NEED NOT BE CATALOGED IN THE\nMASTER CATALOG AS THEY WOULD IF THEY WERE ALLOCATED VIA DD CARDS.\n\nMODIFICATION NAME EXIT10\n\nTHIS IS THE EXIT 10 MODULE RUNNING AT OUR INSTALLATION (ALMOST).  IT\nACCOMPLISHES THE FOLLOWING:\n\nQUEUES MESSAGES DESTINED FOR REMOTES TO THE CPU THAT THE REMOTE IS\nSIGNED ON TO.  THIS ELIMINATES MESSAGE SPOOLING.\n\nCAUSES ALL MESSAGES THAT EMANATE FROM THE JES2 ADDRESS SPACE THAT ARE OF\nINTEREST TO THE REMOTE WORK STATION TO BE SENT TO THE REMOTE AS WELL AS\nTHE LOCAL CONSOLE.\n\nMODIFICATION GATEWAY\n\nPROVIDE A MEANS TO HAVE TWO NETWORKS HAVE TOTAL NETMAIL COMMUNICATION\nBETWEEN THEM WITHOUT EITHER HAVING TO KNOW ALL THE OTHER'S NODE NAMES.\nTHE BASIC APPROACH IS THAT ONE NODE IN EACH NETWORK KNOW OF EACH OTHER,\nBUT NEITHER NEED KNOW ABOUT ANY OTHER NODES IN THE OPPOSITE NETWORK.  AS\nNETMAIL TYPE OUTPUT IS PRESENTED TO EXIT 13, THE RECEIVING NODE EXAMINES\nTHE USERID GATEWAY TABLE FOR A MATCH ON THE (POSSIBLY) PSEUDO USERID.\nIF FOUND, IT USES THE REROUTING INFORMATION TO CHANGE THE NODE NAME AND\nTHE USERID.\n\nMODIFICATION NAME GENTRACE\n\nTHIS CODE, WHICH RESIDES IN A SEPARATE MODULE, SUPPORTS THE FORMATTING\nOF TRACE IDS 200 THRU 230.  THE INTERFACES TO ACCOMPLISH THIS ARE ALL\nIBM SUPPORTED AND PROVIDED.\n\nMODIFICATION OUTPUT\n\nTHIS MODIFICATION ESSENTIALLY REINSTATES THE GLOBAL OUTPUT INITALIZATION\nSTATEMENT DROPPED AFTER SP 1.3.0. THIS STATEMENT PROVIDES DEFAULT VALUES\nFOR ALL OF THE SUB-PARAMETERS PROVIDED WITH THE STATEMENT. THE STATE-\nMENT SUPPORTS ALL OF THE SAME FUNCTIONS AS THOSE SUPPORTED BY THE\n/*OUTPUT STATEMENT AND MOST OF THOSE SUPPORTED BY THE OUTPUT JCL\nSTATEMENT.\n\nMODIFICATION NAME SMF226\n\nTHIS MODIFICATION CAUSES AN SMF 226 RECORD (ALMOST IDENTICAL TO THE TYPE\n26 RECORD) TO BE GENERATED WHENEVER A JOB HAS AN ERROR EITHER AT\nCONVERTER TIME OR INTERPRETER TIME.  THIS IS ESPECIALLY USEFUL FOR USERS\nOF APOLLO/STARS OR DCMS FROM VALUE COMPUTING INC.\n\nMODIFICATION SPOOLPAR\n\nTHIS MODIFICATION IS A SAMPLE SPOOL PARTITIONING ALGORITHM.  IT IS\nIMPLEMENTED USING EXIT 11.  THE APPROACH IS TO DETERMINE HOW MANY ACTIVE\nSPOOL VOLUMES THERE ARE AND TO USE THAT NUMBER TO COMPUTE AN EXTENT\nNUMBER FOR A NEW JOB.  THAT JOB IS THEN RESTRICTED TO USING ONLY THAT\nEXTENT.  THE MAIN USEFULNESS OF THE MOD IS TO \"CUT YOUR LOSSES\" IF YOU\nLOSE AN ENTIRE SPOOL EXTENT.\n\nMODIFICATION STCPARM\n\nTHIS MODIFICATION PROVIDES THE INSTALLATION A MEANS BY WHICH\nAN OPERATOR OR SYSTEMS PROGRAMMER CAN PROVIDE JOB AND /*JOBPARM\nTYPE DATA FOR STARTED TASKS.  THE INFORMATION THAT CAN BE PROVIDED IS:\n   (1) JOBNAME\n   (2) MSGCLASS\n   (3) PRINT ROUTE\n   (4) NOTIFY ID\n   (5) ROOM NUMBER\n   (6) JOB COPIES\n   (7) PROGRAMMER NAME\nNOTICE BY PROVIDING A JOB NAME THAT MATCHES A TIME SHARING USER ID ALONG\nWITH A MSGCLASS WHICH IS A \"HELD\" CLASS, THE TSO USER CAN EXAMINE THE\nOUTPUT FOR A STARTED TASK AT HIS TSO TERMINAL.\n\nTHE INFORMATION CAN BE PROVIDED TWO WAYS:\n   (1) BY SUPPLYING A SPECIAL DD CARD (DDNAME IS $$$$$$$$) WITH\n       NORMAL KEYWORDS WHICH ARE INTERPRETED BY THE JES2 TEXT EXIT.\n   (2) BY SUPPLYING SPECIAL KEYWORDS ON THE START COMMAND WHICH ARE\n       RECOGNIZED BY THE JES2 TEXT EXIT.\n\nTHIS MODIFICATION REQUIRES ABSOLUTELY NO MVS MODIFICATIONS AND ONLY\nTHE ADDITION OF ONE EXIT POINT IN JES2.\n\nMODIFICATION STCPURGE\n\nTHIS MODIFICATION CAUSES STARTED TASK AND TSU JOBS TO BE AUTOMATICALLY\nPURGED IF THE JOB CREATED NOTHING OTHER THAN THE NORMAL SUB-SYSTEM DATA\nSETS.  THE IDEA IS TO USE A NORMAL SYSOUT CLASS (E.G. A) FOR THE\nSTCMCLAS AND TSUMCLAS AND TO ONLY PRINT STC'S AND TSU'S IF SOMETHING\nUNUSUAL HAPPENS.  CURRENTLY THE UNUSUAL THINGS ARE:\n    1. JCL ERROR\n    2. JOB ABEND\n    3. NON SUB-SYSTEM SYSOUT DATA SETS CREATED\n\nMODIFICATION TSOCMD\n\nTHIS IS A RATHER STANDARD MODIFICATION TO ALLOW TSO USERS TO ISSUE JES2\nCOMMANDS AND TO RECEIVE THE RESPONSES BACK AT THEIR TERMINALS.  NOTICE\nTHAT THE RESPONSES ARE SENT BACK VIA TPUT, RATHER THAN SEND COMMANDS.\n\nMODIFICATION USERPROC\n\nTHE ORIGIN OF THIS MODIFICATION WAS THE SHARE JES2 MODS TAPE. THE\nCONTRIBUTOR WAS JIM WALKER OF TUCC.  ADDED AT LOCKHEED WAS THE ACF2\nVALIDATION AND THE USE OF THE $SCAN FACILITY TO SCAN THE JECL STATEMENT.\nALSO ADDED WAS THE USE OF EXITS EXCLUSIVELY RATHER THAN CODE ADDED TO\nIBM MODULES. FINALLY A CALL TO IKJEFF18 FOR THE ERROR MESSAGE GENERATION\nWAS ADDED.\n\nMODIFICATION VTAMPRT\n\nTHIS MODIFICATION IS AN UPDATE AND ENHANCEMENT OF THE MODIFICATION\nORIGINALLY SUBMITTED TO THE JES2 SHARE MODS TAPE BY KNUD NIELSEN.  THE\nCODE HAS BEEN ENHANCED AS FOLLOWS:\n\n  (1) JES2 GENERATES A STREAM OF HASP094 MESSAGES IF AN ATTEMPT\n      IS MADE TO ESTABLISH A SESSION WITH A PRINTER WITH INTERVENTION\n      REQUIRED.  THE SOLUTION IS TO RECOGNIZE THIS FAILURE AND SIMPLY\n      RETRY THE NEXT AUTOLOGON CYCLE.\n  (2) JES2 HALTS A PRINTER WITH WHICH HE HAS ESTABLISHED A SESSION\n      (DCTSTOP IS TURNED ON) IF THE PRINTER HAS INTERVENTION\n      REQUIRED.  THE SOLUTION IS TO TURN OFF DCTSTOP AND $POST\n      THE OWNING PCE WHEN THE LUSTAT IS RECEIVED SAYINT THE PRINTER\n      IS NOW READY.\n  (3) AUTOLOGON IS LOST FOR REMOTES IF A SIMLOGON IS DONE\n      UNSUCCESSFULLY.  THE SOLUTION IS TO SUPPORT AN RPL WITH\n      THE SIMLOGON SPECIAL ACTION AND ONLY THEN TURN OFF AUTOLOGON.\n\nMODIFICATION XM$WTO\n\nADD THE ABILITY TO SEND $WTO MESSAGES FROM ANY ADDRESS SPACE.  THIS\nPRIMARILY IS USED TO SEND MESSAGES TO RJE SITES FROM ADDRESS SPACES\nOTHER THAN THE JES2 ADDRESS SPACE.\n\nTHE TECHNIQUE USED IS TO HAVE A SUB-SYSTEM CALL AVAILABLE WHICH IS\nCALLED WITH THE ADDRESS OF A CMB.  THIS CODE IN TURN CROSS MEMORY POSTS\nA NEW PCE IN THE JES2 ADDRESS SPACE AFTER QUEUEING THE CMB.  THE NEW PCE\nPICKS UP ALL MESSAGES AND QUEUES THEM FOR THE WTO SUB-TASK OR THE REMOTE\nCONSOLE PROCESSOR.\n.pa\n.nf\n@FILE061@***********************************************************************\n*                                                                              *\n*         F I L E   6 1   L O C K H E E D   Q U E U E   F O R   2 . 1 . 5      *\n*                                                                              *\n********************************************************************************\n\nTHIS FILE CONTAINS A VERSION OF THE QUEUE COMMAND FOR SP 1.3.3.\n\nTHE INSTALLATION CONTACT IS:\n\n RICHARD PACE\n LOCKHEED CALIFORNIA COMPANY\n PLANT A-1, BLDG 67, DEPT 8321\n P.O.

JES2 SP 2.1.5\nrequires that the SPOF section be the last section in both the header\nand trailer sections due to the section not being transmitted and the\ntechnique for deleting the section is to simply subtract the length of\nthe section from the header and trailer.  This requires that all user\nsections be placed before the SPOF sections.  If your site dynamically\ninserts user sections at the end of the header or trailer, you will\nbegin to get 'HASP121 ERROR READING JOB HEADER OR TRAILER' messages.\nThis is due to the SPOF section being before your user section.  Note\nthat this message appears on the receiving note and can put the JOB\nRECEIVER in a loop attempting to recover from the error.  This mod will\nallow you to insert user sections after the SPOF section.\n\n.US  MEMBERS\n\nHASPMOD  - Contains the USERMOD to HASPNET to insert the exit point and\n           the SMP control cards to insert the source module NJESECT.\n\nNJESECT  - JES2 load module containing 2 CSECTs - ADDSECT and DELSECT.\n           The mod to HASPNET only references DELSECT inorder to delete\n           the SPOF section.  DELSECT can delete ANY section from\n           either the header or trailer.  ADDSECT will insert a user\n           section (before the SPOF section) to either the header or\n           trailer.  See documentation in NJESECT for more information.\n           A third CSECT is included and is only generated if the test\n           facility within NJESECT is used during assembly.  This\n           allows for easy testing under TSO TEST or BATCH environment.\n           The test facility will add and delete sections to a dummy\n           header/trailer and will verify the results.\n\nTHE INSTALLATION CONTACT IS:\n\n    John Haggard\n    SKK, Inc.\n    10400 West Higgins Rd.\n    Rosemont, IL  60018\n    (312) 635-1040\n.pa\n.nf\n@FILE066@***********************************************************************\n*                                                                              *\n*         F I L E   6 6   T .

It\n *   is designed to eliminate the requirement for connect cards in the JES2\n *   parameter deck describing VM/RSCS connections with JES2.  Connect cards\n *   are still required for those VM/RSCS nodes whose only connection to a\n *   network is via another VM/RSCS node.  The modification adds support for\n *   the reset (K) and concurrence (L) network connection control records.\n *   It is implemented through five (5) source update files:\n *        DMTNCR    -  common NJE initialization control routines (ASM)\n *        DMTNET    -  bi-sync NJE line driver (ASM)\n *        DMTSNE    -  SNA NJE line driver (ASM)\n *        NDWA      -  NJE dynamic work area (MACRO)\n *        NCC       -  NJE connection control (MACRO)\n *\n *   It is assumed that the reader is familiar with maintenence and update\n *   procedures in a VM environment.  The macros, NCC and NDWA, should be\n *   updated and included in a maclib that is referenced during assembly of\n *   DMTNCR, DMTNET, and DMTSNE.  The VM utility VMFMAC can be used to update\n *   the macros and VMFASM to assemble the modules.  Once the assemblies are\n *   done, VMFLKED can be used to create a new RSCS loadlib.\n *\n *   This modification adds a user parameter used in conjunction with the\n *   RSCS configuration control PARM statement specified for both NJE and\n *   SNANJE line drivers.  The parameter, PREDEF=YES/NO, would look like\n *   this:\n *\n *   LINK      BOSTON    NJE  030 * * * ....\n *   PARM      BOSTON    PREDEF=YES BUFF=1024.....\n *\n *   \"PREDEF=YES\" indicates that the line driver is to function as it\n *   does without this modification.  i.e. connect cards are required in\n *   JES2.  This allows the modification code to be put in place without\n *   requiring the JES2 connect cards to be removed.  When the connect\n *   cards are removed, change to PREDEF=NO.  PREDEF=YES should be specified\n *   if two RSCS's are connecting.\n *\n *   \"PREDEF=NO\" indicates that the line driver is to support reset and\n *   concurrence connection control records and provides for dynamic connection\n *   in a network.  This eliminates the need for predefined connections as long\n *   as RSCS is connecting to a JES2 with the Network Path Manager Support.\n *\n *   These modifications are applicable through PUT8602.\n *\n *   Questions regarding these modifications should be directed to:\n *\n *        Richard Pace\n *        D8321, B67, PA1\n *        Lockheed-California Co.\n *        P.O.

These\nchanges revolve around the  topics  of  extended  command support,\nextended tape support, ease of use and security.\n\nEXTENDED COMMAND SUPPORT\n\nCommands Provided by SHARE\n\nThe $J_ commands in exit XJ05$J  are  basically  the same  as  provided\nby SHARE.   The $QF command (exit XJ05$QF) has been expanded and\ndebugged.\n\nCommands Written by WDPSC\n\nThree new commands have been added.  The $ST and $TT commands (exits\nXJ05$ST and  XJ05$TT)  are  used  to modify entries in a new table\npointed to by the UCT.  These commands help control different aspects\nof the extended  tape  support.    The  other  new command, $UNDUMP\n(exit XJ05UDMP) is used to take jobs off the dump queue  without\nhaving  to unload  them.    It nullifies  all  $DUMP  commands since\nthe last spool unload.\n\nCommands Modified by WDPSC\n\nThe commands; $A, $C, $DA, $DI, $DSPOOL,  $LJ,  $TI, $TJ  and $TPRT\nhave all been changed to some degree.\n\nSee the accompanying documentation for  the  details of these changes.\n\nEXTENDED TAPE SUPPORT\n\nThe SETUP Processor\n\nThe  modifications for extended tape support consist of two separate\nfunctions.  First, a  new  processor called  the  \"SETUP\" processor is\nis attached to the JES2 main task.  Its purpose is to produce a  \"SETUP\nSHEET\"  on a special hard copy log and then hold the job.  The setup\nsheet contains information about any special resources needed by the\njob,  like  a  tape mount.    In  this way, the operator can insure\nthat all such resources are available before the  job  is released.\nThe $ST command is provided to prevent more than one processor  in  a\nMulti Access  Spool (MAS)  system from producing the setup sheets.\nThis is necessary  if  the  setup  messages,  which  are actually\nWTO's, are all routed to the same hardcopy log by a global console\ndirector.\n\nTape Drive Affinity\n\nThe  other  part  of  extended  tape  support  is  a facility  to  keep\njobs  that  require tapes and/or produce setup sheets from running on\ncertain members of the MAS.  This keeps processors that do not  have\naccess  to tape drives from selecting jobs that need tape drives.  The\n$TT command is used to change  the tape job \"affinity\" on the various\nsystems.\n\nNJE Accounting Modifications\n\nTwo exits were added to HASPNET to build SMF records for  received\nsysout  and transmitted jobs.   These records contain the necessary\ninformation to  insure that   the  proper  agency  gets  billed  for\nthese services.\n\nMODIFICATIONS FOR EASE OF USE\n\nSeparator Page\n\nA special separator page is created  displaying  the job  name,  class,\njob number, room number (bin) and programmer's name in large block\nletters.   This  is followed  by  several  lines  repeating the\nstandard information.\n\n/*TITLE Card\n\n/*TITLE, a new  JES2  control  statement,  has  been added to override\nthe programmer's name field on the separator page.  The characters that\nfollow the word \"TITLE\"  (separated  by one or more blanks) are used\ninstead of the programmer's name field in the banner page.  An \"O=\"\nparameter has been added to /*JOBPARM which will  also  override  the\nprogrammer's  name.  /*TITLE  overrides  the  \"O=\"  parameter if both\nare present.\n\nThe Trouble Flag\n\nA facility to disable all JES2 exit routines from  a single operator\ncommand has been added.  This allows the system to come up even if some\nfaulty code in an installation  installed  exit  is  causing  JES2  to\nabend.   Each exit checks a  \"trouble  flag\"  before doing  anything.\nIf it is on, the exit immediately returns to JES2 with a return code of\nzero.\n\nInitialization Parameter Changes\n\nSeveral  changes  have  been  made   to   the   JES2 initialization\nparameters.   The most noticeable of these  is  the  breaking  up  of\nthe   \"CONVPARM=\" parameter  of  &STC,  &TSU  and  &x.   This unwieldy\nparameter  has  been  split  up  into  16  different parameters.\n\nTSO Notify Message\n\nThe  TSO notify message has been extended to display the ending\nprogram's return code, abend or user code and date and time\ninformation.    Also,  up  to  15 /*NOTIFY  cards  may be included in\nthe JCL and each user  specified  will  be  notified  when  the   job\ncompletes.\n\nSECURITY\n\nCommand Restrictions\n\nSome  of  the  remote  operator  commands  have been restricted to a\ndegree as well as commands coming in over  the  NJE  network.     See\nthe   accompanying documentation.\n\nPRDUMP EXITS\n     THE STANDARD JES2 PRDUMP CONTROL STMT.

(Basically the same thing as the more\ncommonly circulated \"SPY\" command, but does more things.)  It needs\neither a funny SVC or IKJEFTE2 (and preferably TSO/E Rel 2) to run\nAPF authorized.  It uses a service routine, called TERMIO.  TERMIO\nis created by assembling TERMIO1 through TERMIO5, and linking them\nall together into a loadmod called TERMIO, with entry point TERMIO1.\n\nTMPSRV is a service routine invoked by the TMPMAC macro to allow any\nTSO command to attach another TSO command, or to invoke a CLIST.  It\nbuilds the whole environment that the attached command needs, with a\nsimple, easy to specify set of operands on TMPMAC.  TMPSRV is used by\nthe \"TSO\" subcommand of \"QUEUE\".\n\n           Leonard D.

Print JOBNAME nonslanted in block letters.\n              2. Print ROOM NUMBER nonslanted in block letters.\n              3. Print 5 of the standard IBM detail lines.\n              4.

Print a second trailer page for production jobs.\n\nEXIT002  - JCL standards enforcement and automatic job classing.\n (05/86)\n           This exit performs the following:\n              1. Set default FORMS to $TST for TSO users and test jobs.\n                 (Test jobs at Wells Fargo are defined to be any job or\n                 TSO user that starts with the letter Z.).\n              2. Force PRIORITY to 9 for batch jobs.\n              3. Validate MSGCLASS: Test jobs default to A but can\n                 optionally use C, W, or X.  Production jobs default to\n                 M but can optionally user N or O.\n              4. Do not allow test jobs to submit production jobs via\n                 the internal reader.\n              5. Treat the estimated CPU time in the JOB card\n                 accounting field as seconds (not minutes).\n              6. Determine execution class of test jobs based on\n                 estimated CPU seconds: 0-7 Class K; 8-20 Class D;\n                 21-60 Class E; 61-120 Class B; over 120 Class N.\n                 Additionally, execution classes M, N, R, S, and W are\n                 allowed for special jobs and nighttime or weekend\n                 rates.  Class C is allowed for tape jobs using less\n                 than 120 CPU seconds.  PLEASE NOTE:  There is a known\n                 \"bug\" in this area.  If a test job has anything in\n                 column 71 of the JOB card, the execution class is\n                 incorrectly determined to be class A (production).\n                 The effort to fix this has frequently been avoided by\n                 us due to the \"spaghetti' code in this exit.  We'll\n                 fix it...  some day.\n              7. Allow account numbers in the JOB card to be specified\n                 as either two four-digit strings or as one eight-digit\n                 string.  The two four-digit format uses the standard\n                 four byte ACCOUNT NUMBER field for the first four\n                 digits of the account number and the four byte ROOM\n                 NUMBER for the second four digits of the account\n                 number.  The eight-digit format allows eight digits in\n                 the standard accounting field thereby freeing the ROOM\n                 NUMBER field for it's intended use (to specify room\n                 number).  The eight-digit format also accepts a\n                 seven-digit version since the eighth digit is always\n                 zero.\n              8. Validate that jobs submitted with execution Class S\n                 specify the only valid account number for Class S.\n\nEXIT004  - SOUTWTR Support (add an OUTPUT JCL statement to certain\n (05/86)   types of jobs)\n\n           This exit performs the following:\n              1. If a production job specifies MSGCLASS N or O, this\n                 exit will add an OUTPUT JCL statement to the job so\n                 that a copy of the JES datasets will be created with a\n                 sysout class M.  This class M sysout is subsequently\n                 processed by the SOUTWTR (SysOUT WriTeR) which is a\n                 fancy external write that saves production output in\n                 order to satisfy an auditing requirement we have.\n\nEXIT008  - Maximum Condition Code / Abend Code Support for the\n (05/86)   $HASP165 TSO Notify Message.\n\n           This is the first of two exits (the other is EXIT016)\n           that adds text to the $HASP165 TSO NOTIFY message that is\n           generated by NOTIFY= on the JOB card or by the JES2\n           /*NOTIFY control card.  If the job does not abend, the\n           maximum condition code of all the executed steps is\n           added to the message.  If the job abends, the system or\n           user abend code is added.\n           Examples:\n             $HASP165 jobname ENDED at node - MAX COND CODE 0004\n             $HASP165 jobname ENDED at node - ABENDED SYSTEM 0C4\n             $HASP165 jobname ENDED at node - ABENDED USER 0302\n\n           This exit (EXIT008) locates the maximum condition code or\n           the system or user abend code and stores the value in the\n           JCTUSER1 field so that EXIT016 can later retrieve and\n           process it.\n\nEXIT009  - TSO/E Transmit Overflow Support\n (05/86)\n           This exit allows the TSO/E transmit function to continue\n           after exceeding the installation specified limit for punched\n           data. (TSO/E transmit data is passed as punched records.)\n           We chose to implement this exit instead of increasing ESTPUN\n           because we wanted to allow TSO/E transmit to work while at\n           the same time discouraging the creation of real punched\n           data.\n\nEXIT016  - Maximum Condition Code / Abend Code Support for the\n (05/86)   $HASP165 TSO Notify Message.\n\n           This is the second of two exits (the other is EXIT008)\n           that adds text to the $HASP165 TSO NOTIFY message that is\n           generated by NOTIFY= on the JOB card or by the JES2\n           /*NOTIFY control card.  If the job does not abend, the\n           maximum condition code of all the executed steps is\n           added to the message.  If the job abends, the system or\n           user abend code is added.\n           Examples:\n             $HASP165 jobname ENDED at node - MAX COND CODE 0004\n             $HASP165 jobname ENDED at node - ABENDED SYSTEM 0C4\n             $HASP165 jobname ENDED at node - ABENDED USER 0302\n\n           This exit (EXIT016) retrieves the maximum condition code or\n           the system or user abend code that was stored by in the\n           JCTUSER1 field by EXIT008.  It then adds this value along\n           with the proper text to the $HASP165 message.\n\nJESLOGON - Allows TSO LOGON to any SECONDARY JES2 subsystem\n (03/84)\n           This program allow a TSO user to logon to any secondary JES2\n           subsystem.  It acts as a one-time front end for the standard\n           TMP and is intended to be executed by the LOGON procedure.\n           Job submission and PSO (process sysout) requests are also\n           handled by the secondary JES.\n\nROOM     - TSO ROOM command\n (05/86)\n           This is a TSO command that allows the user to change the\n           room number field in the JES2 JCT for the TSO session.  This\n           command is necessary because the ROOM NUMBER field is not\n           supported by UADS (and the field is overlayed by Wells Fargo\n           accounting information during logon).  ROOM makes it easy\n           for the user to specify delivery information (printed in\n           block letters on the print header and trailer pages via WFB\n           EXIT001) for all sysout created during the session,\n           including spun datasets.\n\n           This code can serve as a model for allowing a TSO user to\n           change (through authorized means) any otherwise protected\n           information in the JES2 JCT or similar control blocks.\n.pa\n.nf\n@FILE089@***********************************************************************\n*                                                                              *\n*         F I L E   8 9    B F S   X E R O X   F O R M S   C O N T R O L       *\n*                                                                              *\n********************************************************************************\n\n         BENJ.

This updates contains ALL the\n             updates done to that member in Bar Ilan; each line of\n             updated source is identified with *xxxxx where xxxxx is\n             the modification name. Thus, to install a specific mod,\n             only cards marked with its name should be applied.  An\n             effort has been made to keep mods as separated as\n             possible.\n\n    @xxxxxa - This is a copy code member. All modifications to JES2\n             source are made using COPY assembler statements, To\n             minimize code transition and repackaging problems.\n             \"xxxxx\" here is the modification ID, and \"a\" is a letter /\n             digit to identify the specific copy code member.\n\n    EX@aaaaa - This is an exit package module. Exits are packaged\n             together on a subject basis, rather than on the exit type.\n             Thus, for examples, several exit 4 routines can (and do)\n             exist in several modules. An exit cross reference will be\n             maintained in the $$EXITS member of JES2DOC.\n\n    Others -  These are members that have to be called by some other\n             name because of some restriction. For example, HASPXIT0\n             has to be called so because of JES2 restriction in exit\n             call time. Any added macro is another example.  A third\n             example is macros and routines from external sources of\n             mods (SHARE etc.).\n\n2.  SYS2.JES2DOC (JES2DOC on the tape).\n    This data set contains the documentation required for the\n    modifications. The following members can be found:  $$DOC  - You\n    are reading it.\n\n    $$MODS  - This is the modification index. It contains 3-4 lines of\n             description for every JES2  modification done (including\n             and modification that is done solely within exits, with no\n             source updates).\n\n    $$EXITS - Contains an exits table, which can be used to locate an\n             exit within a module, and gives a brief description of the\n             exit's function.\n\n    xxxxx  - Where xxxxx is a modification ID - This is a detailed and\n             thorough description of a modification, including source\n             pieces changed, exits used, exit load mudules, copy code\n             members etc.\n\n       Any suggestions, comments, error correction and whatever\n    Will be gratefully accepted and reviewed by:\n\n            Doron Shikmoni  - Systems   (P85025@BARILAN - BITnet).\n            Bar-Ilan University - Computer Center\n            Ramat-Gan\n            Israel\n.pa\n.nf\n@FILE095@***********************************************************************\n*                                                                              *\n*         F I L E   9 5   U B I   M O D S   F O R   1 3 6                      *\n*                                                                              *\n********************************************************************************\n\n            Doron Shikmoni  - Systems\n            Bar-Ilan University - Computer Center\n            Ramat-Gan\n            Israel\n\n  Bar  Ilan  University  JES2 (HJE1367) Modification index\n                         Current JES2 level: see $$DOC.\n\n=======================================================================\nMOD        HITS          ABSTRACT\n=======================================================================\nACF410    HASPSSSM       ACF2 4.1.0 update.

The mod zaps IEASMFEX in nucleus. More\n          info in member itself.\n\nBI00072 - This is an example of an MVS mod to IEFAB423 (common\n          allocation) to use the above mentioned JXE to limit user's\n          tape drive allocation. The special thing about this mod\n          is that it has control over both JCL and dynamic allocation,\n          and thus is a complete solution for tape drive limiting.\n          The mod is used in conjunction with the tape drive system\n          introduced by the Bar Ilan mods.

This program has a lot of\n          documentation inside; please read before installing.\n\nJQSCAN  - A program that uses x-memory services to access JES2\n          job queue to extract any required information (JQE's,\n          mainly) for any STATUS commands and monitors. The\n          main advantage of this, of course, is the elimination\n          of i/o to the checkpoint; all JQE's are read from JES2\n          storage.

THE CONTRIBUTOR WAS JIM\nWALKER OF TUCC.  I DELETED THE ACF2 VALIDATION. IF ANYONE HAS TOP\nSECRET VALIDATION, PLEASE LET ME KNOW. I ALSO CHANGED THE ALLOCATION TO\nJES200 TO PROC00 BECAUSE WE ARE NOT RUNNING THE DYNAMIC PROCLIB\nFACILITY. BECAUSE OF THIS WE HAVE BEEN RUNNING WITH ONLY ONE CONVERTER,\nOR ABENDS RESULT. I REPLACED THE EXIT 4 WITH ONE I HAD IN THE 1.3.3\nVERSION OF USERPROC, WHICH EXPECTS /*PROCLIB=DSN.

In some\ncases they may be used as is; in other cases, they are better used as\nsamples for installation-specific requirements. Several of the mods as\nwritten depend on changes to control blocks such as JCT, PDDB, etc.,\nwhich are not included here. The Node Security mods require a flag\ndefinition in the NIT, which IS included here.\n\nPlease note the standard disclaimer notice that covers all\ncontributions to the JES2 Mods Tape. Questions are welcome, but\ncorrections cannot be promised.\n\nInquiries or suggestions may be directed to:\n\n                 J. O. Skip Robinson\n                 Security Pacific Automation, Inc.\n                 611 N. Brand Blvd. MC G12-99\n                 Glendale, CA  91203\n                 (818) 507-3358\n\nFollowing is a brief description of the SPAC mods, which are supplied\nin SMPE format with REQ dependencies on other mods. PRE sysmods are\nincluded to satisfy SMPE ID processing and to certify that the mod has\nbeen verified to function properly with the indicated IBM maintenance.\n\n- SECAUTH\n\nThis member contains modifications that allow an installation to\nselectively propagate SAF (e.g. RACF) Userid and Group across network\nnodes. As supplied by IBM, HASPNET and HASPRDR contain code that zero\nthese values when a job is transmitted or received through an NJE\nnetwork. Bypassing this code unconditionally exposes an installation to\nmischief perpetrated by unknown persons at a foreign node. On the other\nhand, if another node is controlled by the same Security management,\nthen userids may be presumed to be represent the same individual at\nboth nodes and security may be handled across nodes with the same\nassurance as within a single node.\n\nThe SPAC mods allow an installation to define via initialization parms\nwhich nodes are 'secure' and which are not. If a node is 'secure', then\nthe IBM zeroing code is bypassed; otherwise it is executed as supplied.\nA User Table is provided for the node definition parms to include two\nnew parameters: SECAUTH and NOSECATH (default). Code is added to\nHASPRDR and HASPNET to byass the IBM id-zeroing code only if the\n'other' node is defined with the keyword 'SECAUTH'.\n\n- SJEXDMY\n\nThis member defines 'dummy' exits that may be used as 'switches' to\ngovern functions contained in other exits or inline mods. Thus\nfunctions may be turned on or off via operator commands that enable or\ndisable the appropriate dummy exit. A dummy exit may offer a simpler\ntechnique than writing another exit routine to perform the desired\nfunction.  See SPAC Exit 4 (SJEX004) for an example.\n\n- SJEX001\n\nThis is an example of creating installation-specific separator pages.\nThe member contains code for both Exit 1 and Exit 15, which at SPAC are\ncontained in a single load module.\n\n- SJEX004\n\nThis exit illustrates how to process installation-provided JECL cards.\nWhen a SPAC JECL card (/*SPBPARM) is detected, it is scanned using the\nstandard JES2 $SCAN service, which sets flags or stores values in\nuser-defined control block extensions. This code should be used\nprimarily as an example, as the user-defined control block extensions\nthat record keyword values are not included here.\n\nAnother function illustrated is insertion of additional cards--in this\ncase // OUTPUT cards--into a job stream BEFORE a known point in the\ninput JCL. Exit 4 conventions provide for insertions AFTER the\n'current' card. The SPAC code uses a 'recycling' technique to save the\n'current' card, insert new cards, and finally 'reinsert' the original\ncard in its proper sequence.  Insertion is controlled by enabling or\ndisabling a 'dummy' exit which contains no functional code but serves\nas a 'switch' for card insertion.  NOTE:  IMPROPER CODING OF THE\nINSERTION FUNCTION MAY RESULT IN A LOOP IN HASPRDR THAT REQUIRES A JES2\nALL-SYSTEMS RESTART TO RECOVER.  The exit as presented here avoids the\nloop condition.\n\n- SJEX005\n\nThis command exit contains a lot of code borrowed from other\ninstallations' mods.  The major original contribution is a facility to\ndisplay or dynamically modify the RDT to add or change DESTIDs without\nthe need for a JES2 restart.  Command syntax is summarized below:\n\n   Display only:\n\n       $DDESTID,{NAME=xxxxxx}\n                {DEST=NxxRxx}\n\n   Change and display:\n\n       $TDESTID,NAME=xxxxxx,DEST=xxxxx,{ADD}\n                                       {REPLACE}\n\n       The operator must indicate whether a REPLACE or ADD is being\n       done, and the current RDT is validated to be compatible with the\n       intended update: for REPLACE, the DESTID must already exist; for\n       ADD, it must not. For REPLACE, the appropriate RDT entry is\n       altered in place.  For ADD, a new RDT is built and the old one\n       FREEMAINed.\n\n- SJEX008\n\nThis exit works in conjunction with exit 16 (SJEX016) to include in the\n'job ended' notify an indication of ending status (abend code or max\ncondition code) as well as date and node information.  Exit 8 extracts\nthe status, exit 16 formats the message.\n\n- SJEX013\n\nThis exit allows a TSO user to be notified of incoming TSO/E XMIT mail.\nIf the user is not currently logged on, it forces a 'notify logon' on\nthe current MAS member on the assumption that BRODCAST is shared. SPOOL\nmay or not be shared.  A LISTBC or relogon is required to actually\nreceive the notify if the user is not logged on in the current MAS\ncomplex.  Default IBM processing will not issue the notify if the user\nis not currently logged on.\n\nThe exit also forces netmail to class B, as VM/RSCS may use a print\nrather than punch class, resulting in printed--i.e. lost--mail.\n\n- SJEX016\n\nThis exit works in conjunction with exit 8 (SJEX008) to include in the\n'job ended' notify an indication of ending status (abend code or max\ncondition code) as well as date and node information.  Exit 8 extracts\nthe status, exit 16 formats the message.\n\n- SJSERV\n\nMod to HASPSERV to display updated buffer count for active receiver/\ntransmitter in response to $DU,LNEx. With this mod, the operator will\nbe able to distinguish a hung transmission from a slow one. Also,\nalthough the buffer count may not equal the number of records reported\nin message HASP530, the operator can get an idea of where the\ntransmission is at: first 10%, middle, last 10%.\n\n- NCATLG22 and NCATLG31 (for MVS 2.2.0 or 3.1.0)\n\nAlthough these are MVS rather than JES mods, they are included here.\nEither mod causes message IEF287I 'NOT CATLG 2' and similar messages to\nappear in the system and job logs where they are more readily apparent.\n.pa\n.nf\n@FILE104-109@*******************************************************************\n*                                                                              *\n*         F I L E   1 0 4 - 1 0 9   W S O   M O D S   F O R   2 1 5            *\n*                                                                              *\n********************************************************************************\n\nTO:      SHARE JES2 Modification Tape\n\nFROM:    Dan Parsons/Jerry Travis\n\nSUBJECT: JES2 Modifications\n\nDATE:    March 10, 1988.\n\n\nABSTRACT\n\n.ju left\nThe Washington State Data Processing Service Center (WDPSC) has made\nmany user modifications to JES2 version 2 release 1.5.  These changes\nrevolve around the topics of extended command support, extended tape\nsupport, extended accounting support, ease of use and security.  The\nmodifications presented here are basically the same as those presented\nearlier for JES2 1.3.4, but converted for JES2 2.1.5.\n\nEnhancements which have been done since JES2 1.3.4 include a fully\nfunctional system for tracking NJE transmissions, including a COBOL\nprogram to process the generated SMF records.  Changes were made to the\nJES2 Banner page routine to support on-line COM, including an automated\nbilling facility.\n\nExtended Command Support\n\nCommands Provided by SHARE\n\nThe $J_ commands in exit XJ05$J are basically the same as those provide\nby SHARE.  The $QF command (exit XJ05$QF) has been expanded and\ndebugged.\n\nCommands Written by WDPSC\n\nFive commands have been added and one old WDPSC command that was useful\nwith JES2 1.3.4 has been deleted.  The $ST and $TT commands (exits\nXJ05$ST and XJ05$TT) are used to modify entries in a table pointed to by\nthe User Control Table ($UCT).  These commands help control different\naspects of the extended tape support.  Command $QU (exit XJ05$Q) which\nlists jobs by the ACF2 Logon ID (usually the TSO userid) was made\nfunctional.  And two more commands, $AF and $NA (exits XJ05$AF and\nXJ05$NA) were added to dynamically alter the rest of our parameter\ntables in the $UCT.\n\nWith the total restructure of spool offload/reload in JES2 2.1.5, the\n$UNDUMP command was no longer applicable.  So it has been removed.\n\nCommands Modified by WDPSC\n\nThe commands; $A, $C, $DA, $DI, $DF, $DSPOOL, $LJ, $TI, $TJ and $TPRT\nhave been changed to some degree.  See the accompanying documentation\nfor the details of these changes.\n\nExtended Tape Support\n\nThe SETUP Processor\n\nThe modifications for extended tape support consist of two separate\nfunctions.  First, a new processor called the \"SETUP\" processor is is\nattached to the JES2 main task.  Its purpose is to produce a \"SETUP\nSHEET\" on a special hard copy log and then hold the job.  The setup\nsheet contains information about any special resources needed by the\njob, like a tape mount.  In this way, the operator can insure that all\nsuch resources are available before the job is released.  The $ST\ncommand is provided to turn Setup Sheet processing ON & OFF for each\nmember of the Multi Access Spool (MAS).  An enqueue facility has been\nadded to keep two processors from writing to the same hardcopy log at\nthe same time.\n\nTape Drive Affinity\n\nThe other part of extended tape support is a facility to keep jobs that\nrequire tapes from running on certain members of the MAS.  This keeps\nprocessors that do not have access to tape drives from selecting jobs\nthat need tape drives.  The $TT command is used to change the tape job\n\"affinity\" on the various systems.\n\nExtended Accounting Support\n\nGeneral Accounting Modifications\n\nThe four character account code in the JOB card accounting field has\nlong been inadequate at WDPSC.  Since early versions of JES2 a ten\ncharacter account code has been built using the last five characters of\nthe job name and the last character of the room number (which is used a\na bin number at WDPSC) in addition to the four character account code.\nThis is called the \"old style\" account code.  Since IBM has alleviated\nthe four character restriction, a provision is made for a \"new style\"\nten character account code, which is not currently implemented.  A\nspecial form of the job initiation SMF record is created which contains\nthis ten character code for all jobs run at WDPSC.\n\nThe ten character accounting number along with the JES2 job number is\npassed by the JES2 banner page to the on-line fiche processor for all\nfiche output not requiring a special job setup.  This allows our billing\nsystem to bill the specific job for the fiche produced based on the\naccounting information created by the on-line COM device, and not by\nestimates from SMF type 6 (job output) records.\n\nNJE Accounting Modifications\n\nTwo exits were added to HASPNET to build SMF records for received sysout\nand transmitted jobs.  These records contain the necessary information\nto insure that the proper agency gets billed for these services.  Output\ncoming in over the NJE network (or jobs transmitted to other nodes)\nwithout proper accounting information may be either cancelled, or\nassigned a default account number on a node by node basis.\n\nChanges have also been made to write out an SMF type 24 (Spool Offload)\nrecord for all NJE activity.  This record has been slightly modified to\ndistinguish it from the regular spool offload record.  It contains the\nactual count of transmitted/received records, which is used for billing\npurposes.  We have found NJE activity to be extremely CPU intensive and\nhence, costly.  It was real short sighted on IBM's part not to include\nan adequate facility for tracking NJE transmissions.\n\nThe NJE SMF type 24 records are processed by a COBOL program (NSMFMRG)\nwhich merges them with our installation generated SMF 129 records\n(produced by XJ252SMF and the initiator mod).  It produces an output\nrecord which is readable by our PACE billing system, and an error\nreport.\n\nModifications for Ease of Use\n\nSeparator Page\n\nA special separator page is created displaying the job name, class, job\nnumber, room number (bin) and programmer's name in large block letters.\nThis is followed by several lines repeating the standard information.\nThe repeating line is altered for COM sysout class \"F\" and the banner is\ntotally suppressed by COM class \"I\".\n\n/*TITLE Card\n\n/*TITLE, a new JES2 control statement, has been added to override the\nprogrammer's name field on the separator page.  The characters that\nfollow the word \"TITLE\" (separated by one or more blanks) are used\ninstead of the programmer's name field in the banner page.  An \"O=\"\nparameter has been added to /*JOBPARM which will also override the\nprogrammer's name.  /*TITLE overrides the \"O=\" parameter if both are\npresent.\n\nThe Trouble Flag\n\nA facility to disable all JES2 exit routines from a single operator\ncommand has been added.  This allows the system to come up even if some\nfaulty code in an installation installed exit is causing JES2 to abend.\nEach exit checks a \"trouble flag\" before doing anything.  If it is on,\nthe exit immediately returns to JES2 with a return code of zero.\n\nInitialization Parameter Changes\n\nSeveral changes have been made to the JES2 initialization parameters.\nWDPSC modifications are supported by extensions to existing parameters\nand by making up totally new ones.  The syntax of the added parameters\nhas been changed to follow the lead of the new format adopted by JES2\n2.1.5.\n\nTSO Notify Message\n\nThe TSO notify message has been extended to display the ending program's\nreturn code, abend or user code and date and time information.  Also, up\nto 15 /*NOTIFY cards may be included in the JCL and each user specified\nwill be notified when the job is queued for output.\n\nSecurity\n\nCommand Restrictions\n\nSome of the remote operator commands have been restricted to a degree as\nwell as commands coming in over the NJE network.  See the accompanying\ndocumentation.\n.pa\n.nf\n@FILE110@***********************************************************************\n*                                                                              *\n*         F I L E   1 1 0   $ Q N E T   C O M M A N D                          *\n*                                                                              *\n********************************************************************************\n\n(c) Copyright  1988,  Doron Shikmoni,  Bar-Ilan University\n\n           +----------------------------------------+\n           |                                        |\n           | A Network Command Set for JES2 Systems |\n           |                                        |\n           |         February 15, 1988              |\n           |                                        |\n           |            Version 1.1                 |\n           |                                        |\n           |  Doron Shikmoni, Bar-Ilan University   |\n           |                                        |\n           +----------------------------------------+\n\n\no General\n  -------\n\n  The requirement for a more  comprehensive and user-oriented set of\n  network related query  commands in JES2 has always  been a painful\n  problem, whose implications  are only growing when  JES2 nodes are\n  joining the backbone of EARN (and Bitnet, too).\n\n  This  memo  will  propose  a  limited set  of  query  commands  to\n  alleviate this problem,  and make life in a  JES2 environment less\n  stressing for some types around the network.\n\n  The rule of thumb here has been \"no mods\".  We want this set to be\n  installed at as many JES2 sites as possible.  We will make it self\n  contained, encapsulated within one exit module.\n\n\no Considerations\n  --------------\n\n  The first idea that comes to  mind when trying to outline a syntax\n  for  a command set  for the  EARN/Bitnet community,  is  a set  of\n  RSCS-like command, syntax-wise, i.e. commands like \"Q SY Q\" and \"Q\n  linkid F\", \"CPQ\" etc.\n\n  This  approach has  been examined,  and dropped.  A few  arguments\n  given:\n\n  (1) The  RSCS syntax  is not  extremely user-friendly itself.  The\n      only benefit in using it is  the fact that it is already known\n      among many users.  This, however, may lead to expectations for\n      similar format of the returned output, which is undesired. The\n      structure and design of the JES2 networking (sub-)subsystem is\n      very different from that of RSCS,  thereby inducing  different\n      output requirements.\n\n  (2) In order to serve commands that do not begin with the good old\n      dollar sign (the JES2 most common command character), JES2 has\n      to be modified. As small as  this modification may be  (and it\n      is small indeed), it will cause many site directors to  refuse\n      to even  look at the proposed code.  If we want  to \"sell\" the\n      product, we must not make this mistake.  Thus, the command set\n      must be comprised of dollar-sign prefixed  commands ONLY. This\n      already enforces a syntax quite different from that of RSCS.\n\n  (3) Another  limitation  is the  \"standard\" JES2  command parsing,\n      which  squeezes  out  all  blanks in  non-quoted  parts  of  a\n      command.  Circumventing this, again, needs a mod  which is out\n      of our ballpark.\n\n  (4) JES2 has quite  a large set of commands of  its own. We should\n      make all  possible attempts not  to collide with  existing IBM\n      commands and POSSIBLE INSTALLATION-WRITTEN commands. This will\n      be done best by selecting a hopefully-unique command prefix.\n\n   All these arguments call for a unique syntax, rather than leaning\n   on any previously known commands.\n\n\no Implementation\n  --------------\n\n  As mentioned,  the command  set is  implemented in  a JES2  exit 5\n  (command processing exit).  There is also a small  exit 10 routine\n  which   helps  in   message   formatting.  It   needs  no   source\n  modifications whatsoever, just assembly  and specification in JES2\n  startup parameters.\n\n  Currently,  the module  will  assemble and  run  correctly on  the\n  following JES2 releases:\n\n     SP 1.3.3\n     SP 1.3.4\n     SP 1.3.6\n     SP 2.1.5\n     SP 2.2.0\n\n  All commands start with the prefix $QNET.\n\n\no Command description\n  -------------------\n\n  In this description, we  will reference  output messages  that are\n  defined in the next section.\n\n\n  1.

Path information:\n\n         +-----------------------+\n         |            N=<nodeid> |\n         | $QNET,PATH,           |\n         |            <nodeid>   |\n         +-----------------------+\n\n     nodeid - node name, e.g. TAUNIVM.\n\n     Output: MSG6, or MSG4.\n\n\no Output messages\n  ---------------\n\n  All the messages described below, take either of two formats:\n\n  (a) When not destined to an interactive user (e.g., going to the\n      operators console), the format is as shown below.\n\n  (b) When destined  to an interactive  user, the message  id (the\n      HASPxxx prefix) is be replaced  by \"*Qnet: \" and  message is\n      re-aligned to squeeze out the normal JES2 \"time\" and \"jobid\"\n      fields.\n\n| When  ALL or SUMMARY is requested,  and the output  is non-null,\n| MSG0 below (\"Command complete\") will follow the last line.  This\n| may help automatic polling servers  determine when variable size\n| output is complete.\n\n  The following messages will be returned to the originating user:\n\nMSG0: $HASP000 Command complete.\n\nMSG1: $HASP941 LINEnn <drained>|<active>|<connected to node nnnnnnnn>|\n                      <not NJE>.\n\nMSG2: $HASP942 Node nnnnnnnn is not directly connected.\n\nMSG3: $HASP943 Stream Lnn.ssn <receiving>|<sending> job nnnn\n               to nnnn(uuuu) 999 recs (left 222).\n\nMSG4: $HASP944 Node nnnn is not defined.\n\nMSG5: $HASP945 nn files (totalling nn,nnn records) eligible for\n|              <LINEnn(nnnnnnnn)>|<network transmission>.\n\nMSG6: $HASP946 Node nnnnnnnn is <unreachable>|<reachable via:\n               path1, path2,..>\n\n|     (\"pathn\" may be a directly connected node, or *linename\n|     if nnnnnnnn is directly connected, or \"*Spool\" if it is\n|     connected to a different MAS member in the same node).\n\nMSG7: $HASP947 <No connected NJE lines found.>  |\n|              <No output generated.>           |\n|              <No NJE queues found for active links.>\n\n\n\n\no Installation\n  ------------\n\n  1. Assemble and link-edit the module into your JES2 load library\n     (or SYS1.LINKLIB).\n\n  2. Assuming the module is named EX@$QNET, add the  following three\n     statements to your JES2 startup deck:\n\n     LOAD   EX@$QNET\n     EXIT5  TRACE=NO,ROUTINE=($QNETX5)\n     EXIT10 TRACE=NO,ROUTINE=($QNETX10)\n\n     If your installation has its own  JES2 exits 5 and/or 10 coded,\n     the $QNET code  can probably coexist with them  (unless they do\n     something really weird). The  installation exits should also be\n     included in the ROUTINE= operand of the EXITn parameter.\n\n     For exit 5, the order of  the exits is probably immaterial. For\n     exit  10, it  is recommended  that  the $QNET  exit routine  be\n     placed first  (before installation routines).  Final evaluation\n     is, of course, left to the installer.\n\n  3. Warm start (hot start will not do) your JES2 system.\n\n\no Known Limitations\n  -----------------\n\n  There are some limitations to the accuracy of the details that can\n  be displayed  in a command exit  that does not involve  any source\n  mod.  The data  displayed  can  be accurate  only  insofar as  the\n  control blocks from which the  information is extracted are. Thus,\n  there might be case when  inaccurate information may be displayed.\n  For example:\n\n  (a) Some  network nodes  set NJHGNREC (total  record count  in job\n      header) to 1, regardless. This, of course, will compromise the\n      accuracy of our display.\n\n  (b) The \"running record count\" in JES2 is an internal counter that\n      includes  the  job/dataset  header records,  while  the  total\n      (file)  record  count does  not.  Small  differences may  thus\n      occur.\n\n  At any rate,  the code should be smart enough  to handle all these\n  anomalies, in a way that  will not compromise system integrity and\n  will present output that makes sense. The cases are rare anyway.\n\n  Also, at present, $QNET will not display multiple NJE trunks on the\n  \"ACTIVE\" and \"QUEUE\" subcommands, when given with a node name. Only\n  the FIRST connected line will be displayed.\n\n\n\n\no Disclaimer\n  ----------\n\n  The code is distributed on an as-is basis, with all the well known\n  implications of this notion. It is  up to you to finally determine\n  the  applicability   and  functionality   of  the  code   in  your\n  environment.  Neither the  author nor  Bar-Ilan University  can be\n  held  responsible  for  any  type of  damage  caused  directly  or\n  indirectly by the code, or  for the accuracy of its documentation.\n  Along  the same  lines,  there  is no  commitment  - expressed  or\n  implied - to supply any kind of support.\n\n\n\no Acknowledgements\n  ----------------\n\n  I would like to express deep thanks to the following persons, for\n  volunteering to test the program on their production systems  and\n  for supplying invaluable input for correcting and enhancing it:\n\n  Peter Sylvester, GMD.\n  Jim Walker, TUCC.\n  Jack Schudel, NERDC.\n\n  Thanks also to  Eric Thomas  of  Ecole Centrale de Paris  for his\n  comments and suggestions.\n.pa\n.nf\n@FILE111@***********************************************************************\n*                                                                              *\n*         F I L E   1 1 1   S P A C   S D S F   M O D S   ( 1 . 1 . 0 )        *\n*                                                                              *\n********************************************************************************\n\n.ju left\nSECURITY PACIFIC AUTOMATION (SPB) SDSF MODS FOR 1.1.0 (HQX1102)\n\nFile added to SHARE JES2 Mods Tape July 1988.\n\nThe mods in this file have been updated for release 1.1.0, the first\nProgram Product version of SDSF, and are suitable for with JES2 2.2.0.\n(HJE2221).

The\napproach facilitates the detection of invalid jobs on the entry to the\nsystem, reducing also the spool space occupied by the jobs awaiting for\nlater accounting information check.  The implementation is possibly too\nmuch installation-oriented to be of immediate use to anybody else but\nan effort has been made to make as much as possible of the code to be\ntable-driven, installation-dependent code is marked as so.  The\nfunctions implemented enable dynamic reloading of the Accounting and\nJCL tables without the need of restarting JES2 nor IPLing MVS.\n\n Exit 01 created for MVS/JES2 working under VM and providing spooling\nservices follows.\n\n Exit 04 is also used to scan incoming JES2 Commands from different\nsources, checking the source and performing some screening. It\ncomplements COMJES2 facility with some added security.\n\n Exit 05 is a byproduct of an operator action resutling from the\ncuriosity how $PQ,ALL would work, it worked! The other functions of the\nExit give some debugging/zapping facilities for all modules loaded in\nthe JES2 address space and control of Exit 02,04,24, changing their\nmode of operation and dynamicaly reloading Accounting Table. It aslo\nprotects itself and Exits 02,04,24,26 from being deactivated.\n\n The facility is based on User-defined $UCT, pointed to from $HCT, $ACT\nis pointed to from $UCT, $UCT is also serving as interexit\ncommunication area and SAVE area holder.\n\n The next is the TSO/JES2 Command facility enabling TSO Users to send\nJES2 commands and receive the replies from JES2, it needs Exit 255 to\nbe implemented in HASPRDR. The byproducts are the support of some MVS\nOperator Commands and CP Commands of VM.  It is intended as the cheap\nalternative for JES2 shops not having SDSF as the means of entering\nJES2/MVS Commands from the TSO screen.\n\nThe set of JES2/SP SPOOL Servicing/Reporting programs consisting of:\n   SPOOLANL - The program reporting the JES2/SP Checkpoint/Spool\n              contents and parameters, preprocessed information for\n              other programs of the group, monitoring critical spool\n              parametrs under ISPF on request or in continous mode.\n   SPOOLNET - The program reporting the contents of the JES2/NJE\n              queues.\n   SPOOLPRT - The program printing the data received from SPOOLANL\n              in different forms (sorted by different criterions)\n   SPOOLPUR - The program purging outputs from JES2/SP SPOOL using\n              time of creation and current date/time as guidelines.\n   SPOOLSEL - The program processing the SPOOL Offloaded Data Set\n              (or tape) created by standard JES2 facility.

(HJE2221).  Because of the many\nstructural changes in this release, the use of these mods for any of\nthe program offering releases will require considerabe retrofitting.\n\nPlease note the standard disclaimer notice that covers all\ncontributions to the JES2 Mods Tape. Questions are welcome, but\ncorrections cannot be promised.\n\nInquiries or suggestions may be directed to:\n\n                 J. O. Skip Robinson\n                 Security Pacific Automation\n                 611 N. Brand Blvd.\n                 Mail Code G12-99\n                 Glendale, CA  91203\n                 (818) 507-3358\n\nFollowing is a brief description of the SPAC mods, which are supplied\nin SMPE format with REQ dependencies on other mods. PRE sysmods are\nincluded to satisfy SMPE ID processing and to certify that the mod has\nbeen verified to function properly with the indicated IBM maintenance.\n\n- DEFAULT SCROLL SETTING (SSDSDP1 SSMAIN1 SSJDS01)\n\nThese mods change the default scroll amount from PAGE to CSR.  Note\nthat under ISPF, changes to scroll amount are retained in the user's\nprofile. Hence this mod is most useful for non-ISPF environments of\nSDSF:  TSO command, TMP, or batch.\n\n- NODE-BASED MULTIPLE ISFPARMS (SSINIT1 SSP$TB1 SSP$DEF SSP$001)\n\nThese mods implement a node-based ISFPARMS structure that allows an\ninstallation to provide unique control parms for different JES2 nodes.\nThese mods were developed under a program offering version of SDSF that\nrequired ISFPARMS to name the JES2 checkpoint volume.  Since our\ncheckpoint volser differed from one node to another, we had problems\nkeeping track of the right ISFPARMS module for each node.  SDSF 1.1.0\nwith JES2 2.2.0 no longer uses a checkpoint volser, so the value of\nthese mods is diminished somewhat. Nonetheless, we maintain several\nVM/SF guests for R and D where we allow users far more SDSF authority\nthan would be appropriate for a production system.  Furthermore, some\nkinds of IDs, such operator IDs, differ from one node to another: user\nAAA01 may need full command authority at one node but be a 'normal' user\nat another.\n\nThe mods create a set of parms CSECTS within the load module ISFPARMS.\nAt initialization, the appropriate parms CSECT is selected according the\ncurrent JES2 node number. A default CSECT is provided in case a tailored\ndefinition is not found for the current node, with a warning message to\nthe user.  The actual lines of modification to ISFINIT are minimal. The\nmultiple-parms module is created through link edit of various parms\nmembers, each created and maintained separately. A table is added to the\nparms module to locate the appropriate CSECT. A single composite\nISFPARMS load module may be migrated freely to all nodes without danger\nof implementing the wrong definitions.\n\n- $OUTPUT QUEUE DISPLAY (SSIN001)\n\nThis mod defines the JES2 $OUTPUT queue to SDSF with the 'x' character.\nWhen a job completes, it is placed in the $OUTPUT queue for processing\ninto the appropriate dispositon queue (print, xmit, etc.).  $OUTPUT\nqueue residence is normally very brief, but if a job has been held by\noperator or SDSF command during execution, it remains in in the $OUTPUT\nuntil it is explicity released. With this mod, SDSF will display jobs in\nthe $OUTPUT queue via 'ix'. The $OUTPUT queue is also displayed by\ndefault if no queue is specified ('i')\n\n- @ INPUT QUEUE DISPLAY BY DEFAULT (SSIN001)\n\nThis mod caused the @ (job transmit) queue to be display by default with\nthe 'i' command. Note that the 'o' command includes the output transmit\nby default as distributed.\n\n- SPECIAL HANDLING FOR HELD OUTPUT JOBS (SSMAIN1 SSUPRM1 SSUSER1)\n\nThis mod enables special handling for test jobs directed to 'held\noutput' classes reserved for development and never used for production.\nA flag is set when any job is selected from the 'h' display. The user\nexit ISFUSER checks this flag, and if it is on, allows the user greater\nauthority than he would otherwise have. In the example given here, a\nuser can display or manipulate any job from the 'h' display as long as\nhis 'group' owns the job, i.e. first three characters of jobname and\nuserid match. A job selected from another display, such as 'i', 'o', or\n'st', is subject to more stringent rules. ISFPARMS does not provide for\nthis distinction.\n\n- NULL PREFIX RESTRICTION (SSPARS1)\n\nThis mod prevents a 'normal' user from setting prefix to null and\ndisplaying an entire queue. This mod was created to satify the objection\nof operators who find that some users monitor input or output queues and\nthen call to complain about their progress toward the top of the queue.\nOnly users with 'log' privilege may set prefix to null. Others receive\nan error message 'too few parms'.\n\n- ISFPARMS GROUP MACROS (SSPMAC1 SSP$DEF SSP$001)\n\nThese mods simplify somewhat the management of multiple node-based parms\nmembers. They are not required for node-based parms, but make changes to\nmultiple members somewhat easier, especially when a new SDSF release\nincludes new macro operands. Unless multiple-parms are implemented,\nthese mods provide no particular benefit.\n\n- USER EXIT ISFUSER EXAMPLE (SSUSER1)\n\nThis mod is an example of the use of the user exit ISFUSER to provide\nadditional authority checking not provided for by ISFPARMS as\ndistributed. Here are some the features illustrated:\n\n1. Disallow anyone, including system programmers, from viewing any\noutput in the secure class '9'.\n\n2. Allow a user to display his own netmail file regardless of jobname.\n\n3. Allow any user to display 'semi-public' message/utility/SYSUDUMP\nouput (classes A, D, E, T) only if the user's group (first three\ncharacters) owns the job.\n\n4. Use ABEND authority as an indicator to allow a restricted set of\nsystem support personnel to view any class of output, not just the\nsemi-public classes.  Persons given this privilege might include system\nprogrammers, security administrators, production support, etc.  By using\nan ISFPARMS attribute (ABEND command authority), the user exit code is\nnot senstive to userids or groups. If node-based parms are implemented,\nan ABEND-privileged user at one node may be a 'normal' user at another\nnode.\n\n5. Implement a SAF (RACF, ACF2, etc.) interface to permit users to view\njobs on an ad hoc basis according to generic or discreet profiles\nestablished by Security Administration.  The SAF interface simplifies\nISFPARMS administration and offloads much of the work to security\nadministrators, including the decision of whether to allow access in the\nfirst place.  The mechanism illustrated employs a table of jobnames that\nis continually updated with the result of each SAF call. Since the table\nis checked first for authorization, actual SAF calls are minimized.  The\nSAF check (table or external call) is made only if none of the ISFPARMS\nor exit-specific rules has allowed access. If the table fills up,\nentries are reused from the top. The table is created in extended\nprivate above the line during SDSF initialization and freed at\ntermination.\n.pa\n.nf\n@FILE131@***********************************************************************\n*                                                                              *\n*         F I L E   1 3 1   M E L L O N   M O D S   F O R   3 . 1 . 3          *\n*                                                                              *\n********************************************************************************\n\n$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$\n$            ****  ****   ****  ****    ****               $\n$           *    * *   * *    *    *   *    *              $\n$           *      *   *      *    *        *              $\n$            ****  ****   ****     *    ****               $\n$                * *          *    *        *              $\n$           *    * *     *    *    *   *    *              $\n$            ****  *      ****   *****  ****               $\n$                                                          $\n$                  * *****  ****   ****                    $\n$                  * *     *    * *    *                   $\n$                  * *     *           *                   $\n$                  * ***    ****   ****                    $\n$                  * *          * *                        $\n$              *   * *     *    * *                        $\n$               ***  *****  ****  *****                    $\n$                                                          $\n$          ****  *    * *****   ****  *****  *             $\n$         *    * *    * *    * *    * *    * *             $\n$         *      *    * *    * *      *    * *             $\n$          ****  ****** *****   ****  *****  *             $\n$              * *    * *  *        * *      *             $\n$         *    * *    * *  *   *    * *      *             $\n$          ****  *    * *   *   ****  *      ******        $\n$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$\n$                                                          $\n$                                                          $\n$ FUNCTIONAL CHANGES FOR RELEASE    SP3.1.3                $\n$                                                          $\n$ 1.)

SOME  OF THESE  MODIFICATIONS IN\nTHEMSELVES ACCOMPLISH FEW SPECIFIC FUNCTIONS; THEY ALLOW OTHER MODIFICATIONS TO\nBE MADE EASIER VIA EXITS.\n\nTHE MODS INCLUDED ARE:\n    1. LOCAL COMMANDS IN SEPARATE CSECTS.\n    2. SCAN OF /* CONTROL CARDS IN SEPARATE CSECT.\n    3. GENERALIZED ATTACH SUBTASK COMMAND.\n    4. GENERALIZED DISPATCH SUBTASK FUNCTION.\n    5. LOCATE SUBTASK\n    6. MOVE BASE1 CODE TO GET MORE ADDRESSABILITY.\n    7. USE ANY PDS WITH PROPER BLKSIZE AS PROCLIB\n\nTHE MODIFICATIONS  TO JES2 SOURCE  AND MACROS  AMOUNTS TO ABOUT  40 STATEMENTS\nMOST  OF THE  MODIFICATIONS  ARE MADE  VIA COPY  STATEMENTS,  AND VIA  SEPERATE\nCSECTS.\n\nTHE  JOBSTREAM PROVIDED  GENERATES DATASET  \"TUC.SYS.JES2.DISTMOD\" USING THREE\nIEBUPDTE STEPS.  THIS  DATASET MUST BE CONCATENATED BEFORE  SYS1.HASPSRC IN THE\nSYSLIB SPECIFICATION FOR ALL ASSEMBLIES.\n\nTHE FIRST  STEP ADDS ALL  THE NEW MEMBERS  WRITTEN AT TUCC.   MEMBER \"ABSTRACT\"\nDESCRIBES  THE TUCC  MODIFICATION NUMBERING  SYSTEM  AND SPECIFIC  MODIFICATIONS\nNUMBERS. MEMBERS WHOSE  NAMES CONTAIN NUMERICS ARE COPIED  BY THE MODIFICATIONS\nTO THE JES2  SOURCE. MEMBERS \"TUCCCOMM\", \"TUCCRCCS\", \"LOCATE\",  AND \"CMDAH\" ARE\nSEPARATE CSECT ASSEMBLIES.\n\nTHE SECOND  STEP UPDATES SEVERAL  JES2 CONTROL  BLOCKS AND SOURCE  MEMBERS INTO\n\"TUC.SYS.JES2.DISTMOD\". YOU MAY WANT TO MODIFY THE JCL FOR THIS STEP TO PERFORM\nTHESE UPDATES USING YOUR OWN MODIFICATION SYSTEM.  IN ADDITION, YOU MAY WANT TO\nDELETE SOME OF THE UPDATE STATEMENTS IN THIS  STEP IF YOU DON'T WANT TO USE ALL\nOF THE MODIFICATIONS PROVIDED.\n\nTHE THIRD STEP  GENERATES MEMBER KW00030A BY COLLECTING  MACRO DEFINITIONS FROM\nHASPCOMM.   THESE DEFINITIONS  ARE  NECESSARY IN  ORDER  TO  WRITE COMMANDS IN\nSEPARATE CSECTS.   THIS MEMBER  CONTAINS ALMOST 2000  STATEMENTS, HENCE IT WAS\nBETTER TO LET YOU GENERATE IT THAN TO INCLUDE IT.\n\nDATASET \"TUC.SYS.JES2.DISTMOD\" MUST BE ALLOCATED  AND CATALOGUED BEFORE RUNNING\nTHE PROVIDED  JOBSTREAM. IT REQUIRES  ABOUT 450 3330  TRACKS IF THE  UPDATES TO\nHASPNUC,  HASPXEQ, HASPCOMM,  AND HASPRDR  WILL BE  MADE  WITH IT  AS A TARGET\nDATASET - OTHERWISE ABOUT 20 TRACKS WILL DO.\n\nMOD TW00030 - SEPARATE CSECTS FOR NEW COMMANDS\n\n   A VERY SIMPLE MODIFICATION TO HASPCOMM BRANCHES TO CSECT TUCCCOMM JUST PRIOR\n   TO COMMAND SCAN. TUCCCOMM SCANS ITS OWN COMMAND TABLE (GENERATED VIA $COMTAB\n   MACRO) AND  RETURNS INDICATING  MATCH FOUND  OR NOT  FOUND.  IF  A MATCH IS\n   FOUND, HASPCOMM COMMAND  SCAN IS BYPASSED, VALIDATION IS  PERFORMED, AND THE\n   COMMAND IS BRANCHED TO  VIA HASPCOMM EXACTLY AS IF IT HAD  BEEN FOUND IN THE\n   HASPCOMM COMMAND TABLE.\n\n   TUCCCOMM CONTAINS THE COMMAND LOOKUP, THE COMMAND TABLE ($COMTAB), AND A FEW\n   SIMPLE EXAMPLE COMMANDS.  USER WRITTEN COMMANDS MAY BE  INCLUDED IN TUCCCOMM\n   OR MAY BE WRITTEN IN COMPLETELY  SEPARATE CSECTS.  CSECT \"CMDAH\", THE ATTACH\n   AND DETACH COMMAND, IS AN EXAMPLE OF A SEPARATE CSECT COMMAND.\n\n   MOST OF THE HASPCOMM MACROS AND SERVICE ROUTINES MAY BE USED BY THE COMMANDS\n   FROM SEPARATE CSECTS.  MEMBER \"$COMMSU\" CAN BE  USED AS A STARTING POINT FOR\n   WRITTING A NEW COMMAND IN A SEPARATE CSECT.\n\nMOD TW00100 - RDR CONTROL CARD SCAN IN SEPARATE CSECT\n\n   A VERY SIMPLE MODIFICATION TO HASPRDR CALLS  CSECT \"TUCCRCCS\" TO SCAN /* AND\n   //* CONTROL CARDS BEFORE THEY ARE SCANNED BY DISTRIBUTED CODE. RETURN CAN BE\n   MADE SO  THAT INDIVIDUAL  CONTROL CARDS  ARE NOT  SCANNED VIA  HASP. SERVICE\n   ROUTINES SUCH AS RPUT MAY ALSO BE USED FROM THE EXIT.\n\n   TUCCRCCS INCLUDES  THE CONTROL  CARD LOOKUP,  AND AN  EXAMPLE OF  SCANNING A\n   //*PROCLIB CARD.\n\nMOD TW00020 - ATTACH AND DETACH COMMANDS\n\n   CSECT \"CMDAH\" INCLUDES  THE ATTACH AND DETACH COMMANDS, AND  AN ETXR ROUTINE\n   TO CLEANUP IN  CASE OF SUBTASK TERMINATION.  ANY PROGRAM  ACCESSABLE BY JES2\n   MAY BE ATTACHED AS A SUBTASK VIA THE $AH COMMAND. INDEPENDENT MONITOR, TIME\n   OF DAY  PROCESSORS, ETC.  ARE EXAMPLES.  THE COMMAND  MAY BE  TESTED BY $AH\n   IEFBR14 FOR EXAMPLE.\n\n   ADDITIONAL EXAMPLES  ARE SUBTASKS  TO PERFORM FUNCTIONS  THAT MIGHT ISSUE A\n   WAIT  -   FORBIDDEN  FROM   HASP.  WE  USE   LOCATE,  ENQUE,   AND  LOWSPEED\n   TELEPROCESSING SUBTASKS FOR EXAMPLE.\n\n   THE  SECOND OPTIONAL  OPERAND TO  THE  $AH COMMAND  (NAME), ALLOWS  MULTIPLE\n   COPIES OF THE  SAME SUBTASK TO BE ATTACHED  IF DESIRED - IE  ONE SUBTASK FOR\n   EACH LOWSPEED LINE.\n\n   THE THIRD  OPTIONAL OPERAND  OF THE $AH  COMAND IS A  PARAMETER THAT MAY BE\n   PASSED TO THE ATTACHED ROUTINE.\n\nMOD TW00080 - DISPATCH SUBTASK\n\n   THIS IS  A DISPATCHER MODIFICATION  TO ALLOW A  JES2 PROCESSOR TO  $WAIT FOR\n   ACTION BY  A SUBTASK ON  ITS BEHALF.  A  MACRO, $DISPSUB, IS  PROVIDED WHICH\n   DISPATCHES  (POST)  THE  SPECIFIED  SUBTASK, AND  ISSUES  A  $WAIT  FOR THE\n   PROCESSOR.\n\n   THE  SUBTASK FINDS  THE  $WAITING  PCE, GETS  PARMS  FROM  THE PCE  REGISTER\n   SAVEAREA, PERFORMS THE REQUESTED TASK, AND INVOKES THE $DISPJES MACRO TO PUT\n   THE PCE BACK ON THE READY QUEUE.\n\n   NOTE THAT THE SUBTASK MUST BE ATTACHED VIA THE $AH COMMAND - IF THIS HAS NOT\n   BEEN DONE WHEN $DISPSUB  IS INVOKED, A MESSAGE WILL BE  SENT TO THE OPERATOR\n   AND THE JES2 PROCESSOR WILL CONTINUE TO $WAIT UNTIL THE REQUESTED SUBTASK IS\n   ATTACHED.\n\nMOD TW00090 - THE LOCATE SUBTASK\n\n   MEMBER \"LOCATE\" IS  A SEPARATE CSECT ASSEMBLY OF THE  SAMPLE LOCATE SUBTASK.\n   IT PERFORMS  A LOCATE FUNCTION  ON BEHALF OF A  JES2 PCE AND  DISPATCHES THE\n   JES2 PROCESSOR VIA $DISPJES.\n\n   LOCATE SHOULD BE LINKEDITED INTO THE JES2  JOBLIB AS A SEPARATE LOAD MODULE.\n   IT MUST BE ATTACHED VIA \"$AH LOCATE\".\n\nMOD TW00110 - USER PROCLIB\n\n   ANY PDS WITH  BLKSIZE 4240 OR LESS AND  LRECL=80 MAY BE SPECIFIED  TO BE THE\n   PROCLIB FOR  A GIVEN JOB.  CODE IN \"TUCCRCCS\"  SCANS FOR A  //*PROCLIB CARD,\n   SAVES THE SPECIFIED DSNAME, OPTIONAL PASSWORD, AND OPTIONAL VOLUME SERIAL IN\n   THE  JCT.

SINCE THAT TIME, THE BASE MODIFICATIONS\nHAVE CHANGED GREATLY AND SEVERAL MAJOR CHANGES HAVE ALSO BEEN MADE\nTO OUR JES2 BASE UPDATES.\n\nIN ADDITION TO COLLECTING AND REPORTING ON JOB RESOURCE REQUIREMENTS,\nJES2 AND THE CONVERTER ARE MODIFIED TO ASSIGN A JOB ITS JOBCLASS BASED\nON THE RESOURCES REQUIRED (CPU TIME, REGION SIZE, AND NUMBER OF SETUP\nDISK AND TAPE UNITS IN THE MAXIMAL STEP).\n\nTHE FOLLOWING IS PROVIDED AS DOCUMENTATION FOR EACH INDIVIDUAL PDS\nMEMBER:\n\n  $DOC     -  THIS DOCUMENTATION\n\n  XREFASM  -  A CROSS REFERENCE CONSOLIDATION PROGRAM FOR SYSTEMS OF\n              ASSEMBLY ROUTINES.  THIS PROGRAM INPUTS MACHINE READABLE\n              ASSEMBLY OUTPUTS (ASSEMBLER \"H\" OR IFOX), AND OUTPUTS\n              A CONSOLIDATED REPORT OF ALL SYMBOLS (INCLUDING LITERALS)\n              FOR ALL MODULES.\n\n              IF THE MODULES ARE ASSEMBLED WITH XREF(FULL), THE USER\n              MAY ALSO REQUEST PARM=FULL TO OBTAIN A FULL CROSS\n              REFERENCE OF ALL DEFINED SYMBOLS; THE DEFAULT PROVIDES\n              A LIST SIMILAR TO OUTPUT FROM XREF(SHORT).\n\n              NOTE THAT THE INPUT TO THE PROGRAM MAY BE A SINGLE PDS OR\n              A CONCATENATED SEQUENCE OF SEQUENTIAL DATA SETS.\n\n  HOTNEWS  -  A HOTNEWS TRIAL PRINT PROGRAM (NOTE: THIS ROUTINE HAS NO\n              APPLICATION ON JES2 SYSTEMS WITH THE HOTNEWS PTF FOR REAL\n              HOTNEWS).  THIS ROUTINE INPUTS THE PARMLIB INITIALIZATION\n              DECK (OR A CHANGED COPY), FORMATS ANY NEWS ENTRIES AND\n              PRODUCES A HOTNEWS OUTPUT.  THIS IS USEFUL IF YOU ARE\n              CREATING HOTNEWS LINES WITH MORE THAN 66 DATA CHARACTERS.\n\n  IEFVH1   -  ZAP TO THE CONVERTER WHICH ALLOWS THE JES2 XTXTEXIT EXIT\n              ROUTINE TO RESCAN AND/OR MODIFY THE INTERNAL TEXT OF A\n              JOB STATEMENT AFTER THE JOB HAS BEEN CONVERTED.  THIS\n              ZAP SHOULD BE USED IN CONJUNCTION WITH JES2 MODIFICATIONS\n              SUCH AS IN MOD CB-REJCL (DESCRIBED BELOW).\n\n  OPER2    -  A TSO COMMAND PROCESSOR WHICH PASSES JES2 COMMANDS INTO\n              JES2 VIA SVC 34.  NOTE: OPER2 MUST BE LINKED WITH AC(1),\n              INVOKED FROM AN AUTHORIZED LIBRARY AND MUST BE KNOWN TO\n              THE TMP AS AN AUTHORIZED COMMAND (IN CSECT IKJEFTE2);\n              OPER2 ALSO CHECKS FOR AUTHORIZED USERS BASED ON THE\n              FIRST THREE CHARACTERS OF THE USERID.\n\n              THIS ROUTINE REQUIRES JES2 CHANGES TO ALLOW COMMUNICATION\n              FROM JES2 VIA TPUT'S (SEE MOD CB-TPUT BELOW).\n\n  TAPERACK -  A MEMBER CONTAINING IEBUPDTE CONTROLS WITH SOURCE CODE\n              FOR THREE ASSEMBLY ROUTINES, STARTED TASK JCL, A SORT\n              CONTROL STATEMENT, SEVERAL MACROS AND AN INSTALLATION\n              JOB STREAM CALLED $INSTALL (SEVERAL AREAS WHERE JCL\n              CHANGES MAY BE REQUIRED ARE NOTED IN THE JCL).  THIS\n              INFORMATION FORMS A STARTED TASK CALLED TAPERACK.\n\n              THE OUTPUT FROM TAPERACK IS A SORTED LIST OF VOLUME NAMES\n              WHICH SHOULD BE SETUP AND THE JOB(S) WHICH REFERENCE\n              EACH VOLUME.  THIS IS USEFUL IN A SHOP WHICH OUTPUTS\n              LISTS OF SETUP VOLUMES BY JOB AT JCL CONVERSION TIME\n              AS THIS STARTED TASK CAN BE RUN AT ANY TIME TO PROVIDE\n              A CURRENT, SORTED LIST OF ALL VOLUMES WHICH SHOULD BE\n              SETUP ON THE STAGING RACKS.\n\n              ACCESS TO DATA ON THE SPOOL PACKS IS VIA ROUTINES\n              PROVIDED WITH THE QUEUE COMMAND FROM TRW.  NOTE THAT\n              TAPERACK IS DEPENDENT ON A MODIFICATION TO THE JES2\n              JCT WHICH PLACES A LIST OF ALL SETUP VOLUMES FOR EACH\n              JOB IN ITS JCT (SEE MODS CB-CLASS, CB-JOB, CB-EXEC\n              AND CB-DD BELOW).\n\n  JES2     -  A MEMBER CONTAINING IEBUPDTE CONTROLS WITH SOURCE CODE\n              FOR ALL LOCAL JES2 MODIFICATIONS.  EACH MODIFICATION IS\n              IDENTIFIED IN COLUMNS 64 THROUGH 71 WITH THE LETTERS\n              CB-XXXXX WHERE XXXXX IS THE MODIFICATION NAME.\n\n              IN THE FOLLOWING, EACH OF THESE MODIFICATIONS ARE\n              DISCUSSED FURTHER:\n\n    1.  CB-$DF    ADDS TWO METHODS OF CROSS REFERENCING OUTPUT DATA\n                  WITH THE $DF COMMAND.  THE X OPERAND MAY BE USED IN\n                  CONJUNCTION WITH ANY OTHER LEGAL OPERANDS FOR $DF.\n\n                  THE FORM $DF,XFFFF WHERE FFFF IS A PARTIAL FORMS NAME\n                  PROVIDES A CROSS REFERENCE OF ALL JOES AWAITING\n                  OUTPUT WHICH MATCH THE PARTIAL FORMS NAME.  FOR\n                  EXAMPLE, $DF,X10 PROVIDES THE FOLLOWING:\n\n                  $HASP000 XREF J=T34    HSYLPF    PRIOR 11  CLASS B         95\n                  $HASP000 OUT R=LOCAL    F=1044 C=**** T=****  CLASS B= 1\n                  $HASP000 XREF J=J191   H05H0T50  PRIOR 4   CLASS A     18,536\n                  $HASP000 XREF J=J328   C8000JAB  PRIOR 8   CLASS A        659\n                  $HASP000 XREF J=J284   E60HHJ60  PRIOR 9   CLASS A         61\n                  $HASP000 XREF J=S159   C5000JRB  PRIOR 9   CLASS C        406\n                  $HASP000 OUT R=LOCAL    F=1094 C=**** T=****  CLASS A= 3,C= 1\n\n                  THE FORM $DF,X=CCCC WHERE CCCC IS A LIST OF THE\n                  OUTPUT CLASSES PROVIDES A CROSS REFERENCE OF ALL\n                  JOES AWAITING OUTPUT IN THE CLASSES NAMED.  FOR\n                  EXAMPLE, $DF,X=BLDEFX PROVIDES THE FOLLOWING:\n\n                  $HASP000 XREF J=S1     SYSLOG    PRIOR 5   CLASS L      5,905\n                  $HASP000 XREF J=T75    HSYLPF    PRIOR 9   CLASS X        426\n                  $HASP000 XREF J=T34    HSYLPF    PRIOR 6   CLASS X      4,280\n                  $HASP000 OUT R=LOCAL    F=STD.

CB-$DJOB MODIFIES THE $D'JOBNAME COMMAND TO DISPLAY SELECTED\n                 JOBS FOR OUTPUT BASED ON A PARTIAL JOBNAME.  FOR\n                 EXAMPLE, $D'ABCDEF DISPLAYS ANY JOBS WHOSE JOBNAMES\n                 BEGIN WITH ABCDEF; NOTE THAT THE FORM $D'ABCDEF'\n                 REPORTS ON ONLY JOB ABCDEF AS BEFORE.\n\n    3.  CB-$DU    MODIFIES THE $DU MESSAGE FOR ACTIVE PRINTERS AND\n                  PUNCHES TO INDICATE THE NUMBER OF LINES (OR CARDS)\n                  LEFT TO PROCESS.\n\n                  NUMBERS ABOVE 999,999 ARE PRINTED AS 999,999.\n                  IF THE NUMBER OF LINES LEFT IS NOT AVAILABLE, THE\n                  NUMBER OF LINES DONE (D=...) IS PROVIDED INSTEAD.\n\n                  FOLLOWING IS A SAMPLE OUTPUT:\n\n              $HASP000 PRINTER2  00E DRAINING (JOB   140 C5000JTD,L=183,252) ...\n\n    4.  CB-$MJ    ADDS A $MJ AND $M'JOBNAME' COMMAND WHICH MAY BE USED\n                  TO LIST THE VOLUME SETUP REQUIREMENTS (THE VOLUME\n                  NAMES OF REQUIRED VOLUMES) FOR ANY JOB IN EXECUTION\n                  OR AWAITING EXECUTION.  FOR EXAMPLE:\n\n                  $HASP000 D21HOJ03 NEEDS THE FOLLOWING VOLUMES:\n                  $HASP000 D21HOJ03  DISK04 069571 072336\n\n    5.  CB-CHAN1  MODIFIES JES2 HASPPRPU TO COUNT AND/OR CHECKPOINT\n                  PRINTER EJECT COMMANDS ONLY.  OTHER SKIP-TO-CHANNEL\n                  COMMANDS ARE NOT CONSIDERED WHEN COUNTING OR CHECK-\n                  POINTING PAGES.\n\n    6.  CB-CLASS  ADDS SUPPORT IN JES2 TO COLLECT JOB RESOURCE\n                  REQUIREMENTS.  THIS MOD DEFINES MOST SYMBOL NAMES\n                  WHICH ARE USED BETWEEN MODS.\n\n                  THIS MOD CREATES A SORTED LIST OF RESIDENT DISK\n                  DISK VOLUME NAMES FOR LATER CHECKING AGAINST DISK\n                  VOLUME NAMES FROM THE JCL AND THE CATALOG.\n\n                  THIS CODE ALSO MODIFIES THE BASIC JES2 DISPLAY\n                  COMMANDS ($D' AND $DN) TO PROVIDE THE TOTAL\n                  NUMBER OF SETUP DISK VOLUMES AND SETUP TAPE\n                  VOLUMES.  THE FOLLOWING IS AN EXAMPLE OUTPUT:\n\n                  $HASP000 R80H0JSO WAIT EXC M       T=12 D= 1 PRI 11\n\n                  THE $L COMMAND IS ALSO MODIFIED TO OUTPUT THE NUMBER\n                  OF LINES IN EACH OUTPUT CLASS RATHER THAN THE NUMBER\n                  OF DIFFERENT OUTPUT CLASSES.  FOR EXAMPLE:\n\n                  $HASP000 Z88OOJ48 WAIT PPU PRI=08 A  1,017\n                  $HASP000                   PRI=09 C    408\n\n    7.  CB-CRASH  THE TSO SEND MESSAGE IN HASPPRPU IS EXPANDED TO\n                  INDICATE TYPES OF JES2-RELATED JOB CANCELLATIONS\n                  (INVALID CONTROL CARDS, INVALID APPLICATION NUMBERS\n                  AND SECURITY VIOLATIONS) AND THE FACT OF SYSTEM\n                  CRASHES DURING JOB EXECUTION.\n\n                  THE JES2-RELATED MESSAGES ARE RECEIVED AT THE\n                  TERMINAL IMMEDIATELY AFTER JOB SUBMISSION. THE\n                  FOLLOWING IS AN EXAMPLE MESSAGE:\n\n                  $HASP165 JOB 2600  HSYABLZ TERMINATED DUE TO\n                           AN INVALID /*ROUTE STATEMENT    CN(00)\n\n    8.  CB-DD     PROVIDES DD STATEMENT SCANNING FOR UNIT REQUIREMENTS\n                  AND SETUP VOLUMES.

U4240002 THRU U4288002\n\nTHE INSTALLATION HAS MORE RJE STATIONS THAN CAN BE GIVEN ONE\nINITIATOR EACH. THE STATIONS LIKE TO BE ABLE TO CONTROL THEIR\nJOB QUEUES INDEPENDANTLY AND RE-ARRANGE PRIORITIES TO SUIT\nTHEMSELVES. THEY MUST NOT BE ABLE TO ADVERSLY AFFECT OTHER\nRJE STATIONS. THIS MOD ALLOWS AS MANY JOB QUEUES AS NECESSARY TO BE\nDEFINED BUT REMOVES THE NEED FOR MANY INITIATORS TO ENSURE A\nREASONABLE SPREAD OF SERVICE OVER ALL THE STATIONS.\n\nTHE PRINCIPLE IS THAT EACH INITIATOR WITH MORE THAN 3 CLASSES IN THE PIT\nROTATES ITS CLASSES AS THEY ARE USED. THE FIRST CLASS IS EXEMPT SO\nTHAT IN OUR CASE IT CAN BE USED TO GUARANTEE FAST SERVICE FOR PRINT\nJOBS FOR TSO USERS. THE OTHER CLASSES ARE ROTATED ONCE EACH TIME\nTHE INITIATOR IS USED. THIS USUALLY ENSURES THAT NO ONE RJE\nSTATION HAS ONE JOB EXECUTED IMMEDIATELY AFTER THE OTHER ON\nTHE SAME INITIATOR, UNLESS THERE IS NOTHING ELSE TO DO. FOR\nSIMPLICITY THERE IS NO ATTEMPT TO ROTATE THE QUEUE TO THE\nCORRECT POINT IF IT WAS NOT THE FIRST CLASS THAT ACTUALLY DID THE\nJOB. IT HAS BEEN FOUND THAT ANOMALIES DUE TO CONTINUOUS ROTATION\nDO NOT SPOIL THE PRINCIPLE. THE ROTATION ALSO HAPPENS IF THE FIRST\nCLASS (IE THE NON-ROTATING) ONE IS USED.\n\n2. U8600002 THRU U8877320\nTHE INSTALLATION USES AN RYO VTAM INTERFACE TO SUPPORT RJE PRINTERS.\nIN ORDER TO PROVIDE DEFAULT PAGINATION A LA JES2, THE LINECT VALUE IS\nNEEDED, BUT NOT SUPPLIED THROUGH THE IEFSSREQ INTERFACE.

EXAMPLES OF THESE INCLUDE STARTING AND STOPPING PER-\n   FORMANCE MEASUREMENTS TOOLS DEPENDING ON THE DAYS OF A HEAVY LOAD,\n   RUNNING DISK BACKUPS AND COMPRESSIONS ON A WEEKLY BASIS, AND\n   EXECUTING ACCOUNTING REPORTS ON A MONTHLY BASIS. FOR THIS TYPE\n   OF AUTOMATIC PROCESSING, THE TWO PROGRAMS 'AUTOCMD' AND 'DAYDATE'\n   EXTEND THE TIME-OF-DAY PROCESSING SUPPORTED BY JES2 AND ADD THE\n   FEATURES OF DAY-OF-WEEK, WEEK-OF-MONTH, AND MONTH-OF-YEAR PROCESSING.\n\n   DAYDATE AS A STANDALONE PROGRAM WILL ISSUE A RETURN CODE OF THE\n   NUMERIC DAY-OF-WEEK (1-7), WEEK-OF-MONTH (1-5), OR MONTH-OF-YEAR\n   (1-12). WHEN CALLED VIA A LINK MACRO IT WILL RETURN THE ABOVE OR,\n   IN ADDITION, WILL RETURN THE THREE CHARACTER REPRESENTATION OF THE\n   DAY-OF-WEEK (MON. - SUN.) OR MONTH-OF-YEAR (JAN. - DEC.)

IT IS\n DESIGNED EXCLUSIVELY FOR USE ON THE 3800 PRINTING SUBSYSTEM.  AS YOU\n ARE AWARE, THE 3800 IS NORMALLY LOADED WITH  11 X 8 1/2\"  STOCK  TAB,\n WHICH  SERVES A VARIETY OF PRINTOUTS.   THERE ARE TIMES HOWEVER WHEN\n AN ALTERNATE SIZE IS DESIRED.  ONE OF  THE  MOST  POPULAR  ALTERNATE\n SIZES IS 8 1/2 X 11\"; THAT IS, 8 1/2\" WIDE BY 11\" LONG.  THE CONTENT\n IS ALMOST INVARIABLY TEXT, FOR PROGRAM DOCUMENTATION, LETTERS, AND\n THE LIKE.  SINCE THIS STOCK IS NOT AVAILABLE, (AND EVEN IF IT WERE,\n WERE, WOULD BE TOO  COSTLY TO LOAD) THE UTILITY IEBROT, AND ITS SPE-\n CIALLY DESIGNED CHARACTER SETS WERE DEVELOPED.\n\n   IEBROT READS YOUR TEXT, AND ROTATES THE MATRIX OF EACH PAGE NINETY\n DEGREES.  THEN, USING ITS OWN SPECIAL 90 DEGREE CHARACTER SET, PRINTS\n ROTATED IMAGES.  THE CHARACTER SET IS A WEIGHTED (SERIF) STYLE, WELL\n SUITED TO TEXT APPLICATIONS.  THE LAYOUT WOULD BE SIMILAR TO THAT OF\n A TYPEWRITER.  THE APPEARANCE IS  OF  TWELVE  CHARACTERS  PER  INCH,\n HORIZONTAL, SIX LINES PER INCH, VERTICAL. YOUR INPUT TEXT MUST BE\n LRECL=80, RECFM=FA OR FBA, THAT IS, AN ASA CHARACTER, FOLLOWED BY 79\n BYTES OF TEXT DATA.  THE MAXIMUM NUMBER OF LOGICAL LINES PER PAGE IS\n 60.  YOU NEED TO OVERRIDE THE JES2 DEFAULT OF AUTOMATIC SKIP TO HEAD-\n OF-FORM AFTER 60 LINES BY SPECIFYING A VALUE OF 90 OR GREATER IN THE\n LINECT PARAMETER OF THE JOBPARM CARD. IEBROT AND ITS CHARACTER SETS\n SUPPORT ALL GRAPHICS ON THE TN ( IBM 1403 ) AND THE T11 ( IBM 3211 )\n PRINT TRAINS.\n\n FILE 41  IEBROT DOCUMENTATION. THE TEXT USES IEBROT FEATURES AND TO\n   GET A FINISHED QUALITY PRINT SHOULD BE PRINTED USING IEBROT. THIS\n   FILE CONTAINS A DESCRIPTION OF IEBROT FEATURES AND RESTRICTIONS AND\n   INFORMATION ON HOW TO INSTALL THE PROGRAM.\n\n FILE 42  IEBROT ASSEMBLER SOURCE STATEMENTS.\n\n FILE 43  IEBROT COBOL SOURCE STATEMENTS.\n\n FILE 44  THE IEBIMAGE SOURCE FOR THE ROTATED CHARACTER SET. THIS IS\n   ONE CONTINUOUS STREAM FOR THREE GRAPHIC MODULES, FOLLOWED BY A\n   CHARACTER ARRANGEMENT TABLE DEFINITION. THIS IS FOR THE NORMAL PRINT.\n   FOLLOWING THIS ARE FOUR MORE GRAPHIC MODULES AND ANOTHER XTB FOR THE\n   BIG-PRINT VARIATION.  RUN THROUGH IEBIMAGE. ALL NAMES ARE OF THE FORM\n   XXXXJ0SY, NO REPLACE.\n\n   AFTER THE BASIC INSTALLATION ABOVE, YOU WILL NEED  TO  VERIFY  THE\n PRESENCE OF FCB'S FOR 8.5 INCHES, ONE FOR 12 LPI, ONE FOR 6 LPI.\n\n   THE AUTHOR OF IEBROT ACKNOWLEDGES EXISTENCE OF THE IUP \"IBM 3800 -\n 90 DEGREE PRINT PROGRAM\", PROGRAM NUMBER 5796-ARE WHICH ALSO DOES 90\n DEGREE PRINTING.  HE SALUTES THE AUTHORS OF THAT PACKAGE WHO HAD THE\n BROAD MINDED THINKING TO INTRODUCE THE CONCEPT, AND THE FORTITUDE TO\n SPEND THOSE LATE NIGHTS CODING ALL THOSE CHARACTERS.\n   IEBROT  IS  NOT INTENDED AS A REPLACEMENT FOR \"ROTATE90\" WHICH HAS\n SOME FLEXIBILITIES NEVER INTENDED FOR IEBROT.  ROTATE90  IS  CLEARLY\n SUPERIOR  FOR \"COMPUTER REPORT\" TYPE PRINTING WHERE A CONDENSED FOR-\n MAT IS DESIRED.\n\n********************************************************************************\n*                                                                              *\n*         F I L E   4 5   J E S 2   P E R F O R M A N C E   M O N I T O R      *\n*                                                                              *\n********************************************************************************\n\n            ***** D I S C L A I M E R *****\n\n   THIS VERSION OF THE JES2 MONITOR HAS BEEN USED SUCCESSFULLY AT\n   DATACROWN INC.

(RYT) AND IS IN IEBUPDTE FORM\nTHE MOD IS FOR JES2 4.1 (SU 25) AT PTF LEVEL 8008.\nLAST FILE UPDATE - 02/25/81\nANY QUESTIONS OR COMMENTS ON THIS MODIFICATION MAY BE ADDRESSED TO:\n\n                   JON WELCH   WA1B08    (617) 475-5000  EXT. 2373\n                   RAYTHEON CO.\n                   350 LOWELL STREET\n                   WEST ANDOVER, MASS.  01810\n\n  THE FOLLOWING MOD IS AN UPDATE TO THE HELD OUTPUT MOD ON FILE 48.\n  THE ORIGINAL MOD WAS WRITTEN FOR JES2 4.1 IPO 4.0.\n     THE LINES FLAGGED IRYT ARE THE CHANGES TO THE CODE RECEIVED\n  FROM NEUCC TO MAKE IT WORK ON 7905 SYSTEM WITH OZ27300.\n  THIS CODE HAS BEEN ON OUR PRODUCTION SYSTEM SINCE 14:00 5/14/80.\n  IT IS NOW BEING USED BY AT LEAST 20 INSTALLATIONS AT LEVELS FROM\n  7905 TO 8010 (OR MAYBE HIGHER BY NOW).\n\n  THE LINES FLAGGED 0281 ARE UPDATES TO MAKE EXTERNAL WRITERS WORK\n  FOR HELD OUTPUT AND TO CHANGE A POSSIBLE LOOP INTO A DISASTEROUS\n  MESSAGE INSTEAD.\n\n  NOTE ALSO THAT THE MOD NOW UPDATES HASPINIT TO ADD SPACE TO THE\n  PCE FOR HASPXEQ.  THE MOD WAS ALWAYS USING THIS SPACE, EVEN\n  THOUGH IT DIDN'T OWN IT.\n\n  WHEN I INSTALLED IPRT MOD FROM SHARE TAPE IT WOULD NOT ASSEMBLE\n  CLEANLY BECAUSE OZ27300 REMOVED A FIELD CALLED JQEJOECT.  I REMOVED\n  THE LINES THAT REFERENCED THAT TAG.  WHEN I TESTED THAT CODE I FOUND\n  THAT ONE DATASET WAS OFTEN PRINTED AGAIN AT THE END OF THE JOB.\n  I ALSO FOUND THAT AFTER A WARMSTART THE WRONG OUTPUT WOULD BE PRINTED\n  FOR A JOB THAT WAS PARTIALLY PRINTED.  THE ORIGINAL MOD STUFFED ALL\n  THE PDDBS INTO THE FIRST IOT, BUT LEFT THE OTHER IOT'S ALONE.  IT\n  SEEMED SAFER TO REWRITE THE OTHER IOT'S WITH THE NULL FLAG ON IN THE\n  PDDB.  TO ACCOMPLISH THIS I AM NOW USING THE LAST IOT RATHER THAN THE\n  FIRST, AND REWRITING EACH ON THE WAY.  SINCE PROCESS SYSOUT CREATES\n  NONALLOCATION IOTS ON THE FLY, IT SEEMS THERE IS NO WARMSTART\n  PROBLEM WITH THIS TECHNIQUE.\n\n    IF YOU USE THIS MOD, PLEASE LET ME KNOW, AND I WILL SUPPLY YOU WITH\n  CORRECTIONS/ENHANCEMENTS.  IF YOU MAKE IMPROVEMENTS ALSO LET ME KNOW\n  INSTEAD OF JUST PUTTING ANOTHER COPY ON THE MODS TAPE BECAUSE SOME\n  OF THE PEOPLE USING THE MOD MIGHT NOT RENEW THEIR MODS TAPE FOR SOME\n  TIME.\n\n    THIS MOD ONLY REJOINS CONSECUTIVE DATASETS WITH LIKE SYSOUT CLASS,\n  ROUTING, FORMS, UCS, FCB.  IF A JOB HAS A PUNCH OUTPUT IN THE SECOND\n  OF 3 STEPS, THE PRINT SYSOUT OF STEP 3 WILL PRINT SEPARATELY.\n  I HOPE TO MODIFY THIS CODE TO AT LEAST GET ALL OUTPUT THAT\n  MATCHES THE JCL TO PRINT TOGETHER, EVEN IF NOT CONSECUTIVE.\n    IT DOES NOT CHAIN IOT'S, SO IT ONLY JOINS AS MANY PDDBS AS WILL\n  FIT IN A BUFFER.  WE GET 31 SYSOUT DATASETS JOINED AND OUR\n  BUFSIZE IS 3664.\n\n  IF WE'RE LUCKY, I.B.M. WILL FIX THE PROBLEM FOR US.\n\n********************************************************************************\n*                                                                              *\n*         F I L E   5 5   P A N S P O O L                                      *\n*                                                                              *\n********************************************************************************\n\nTHE FOLLOWING FILE CONTAINS PANSPOOL, A JES2 SYSMSG SPOOLING SYSTEM.\nTHE FILE IS IN IEBCOPY UNLOAD FORMAT.

ALTHOUGH IT IS A \"QUICK AND DIRTY\" (WITH EMPHASIS ON\n  \"QUICK\") AND NO CONSIDERATION GIVEN TO INSTALLATION DEPENDENCIES,\n  THERE ARE LITTLE OR NO INSTALLATION DEPENDENCIES IN THIS WRITER.\n  WHAT LITTLE THERE IS TO BE CONSIDERED INSTALLATION DEPENDENT WILL BE\n  FOUND IN MODULE \"XEFSD094\" WHICH CREATES THE XEROX \"DJDE\" (DYNAMIC\n  JOB DESCRIPTOR ENTRY). OUR \"DJDE\" FORMAT IS AS FOLLOWS:\n\n     1***XEROX***JDE=X????,END;   (???? = JES2 FORM NUMBER)\n\n  ORIGINALLY THE \"DJDE\" ALSO HAD A \"COPIES=\" PARAMETER SPECIFIED IN IT,\n  BUT IT SEEMS THAT JES2 DOES NOT PRESENT THE DATA SET COPY COUNT TO\n  THE EXTERNAL WRITER WITHOUT SOME MODIFICATION TO JES2. THIS MEANS THAT\n  IF ONE SPECIFIES A COPY COUNT IN THE JCL VIA \"JOBPARM\" OR \"DD\"\n  STATEMENT, ONE WILL GET THAT NUMBER OF COPIES OF THE DATA SET(S)\n  ON THE RESULTANT EXTERNAL WRITER OUTPUT TAPE. TO OVERCOME THIS PROBLEM\n  WE DEFINE THE COPY COUNT IN THE XEROX \"JDE\" (JOB DESCRIPTOR ENTRY)\n  IN THE XEROX 9700 OPERATING SYSTEM AND DISALLOW COPY COUNT SPECI-\n  FICATIONS IN THE JCL.\n\n  I.E.  //SYSPRINT  DD SYSOUT=(X,,ST04)  (ST = STANDARD  04 = 4 COPIES)\n\n  THE SMF TYPE 6 RECORDS WRITTEN BY THIS WRITER ARE INDENTICAL TO THAT\n  WHICH IS PUT OUT BY THE DISTRIBUTED EXTERNAL WRITER FOR UNIT-RECORD\n  DEVICES EXCEPT THAT THE \"SMF6OUT\" FIELD IS FILLED IN WITH THE JOB\n  NAME EXTRACTED FROM THE TIOT OF THE WRITER.

THE ONLY PROBLEM WE HAVE EVER\n  ENCOUNTERED HAS BEEN IF A DATA SET HAS INVALID ANSI OR MACHINE\n  CONTROL CHARACTERS, THE REMAINDER OF THE DATA SET WILL BE IGNORED\n  (I.E.

TO ACCOMPLISH THIS IT UTILIZES THE\n    STANDARD CONVERTER INTERNAL TEXT EXIT FIELD IN THE CONVERTER WORK\n    AREA (LABEL \"CWATXTEX\" IN MACRO \"IEFCVRWA\") TO INSINUATE ITSELF\n    BETWEEN THE CONVERTER AND JES2 PROCESSING. IN EVERY RELEASE OF\n    OS/360 AND OS/VS I HAVE WORKED WITH (OS/MFT, OS/MVT, SVS, MVS), THE\n    CONVERTER/INTERPRETER HAS ALWAYS CARRIED THE ADDRESS OF THIS WORK\n    AREA IN REGISTER 12 THROUGHOUT ITS PROCESSING. WHEN IEFUJV IS ENTER-\n    ED TO PROCESS THE FIRST JOB CARD JCL-IMAGE, IT IS ASSUMED THAT\n    REGISTER 12 IS POINTING TO THE CONVERTER WORK AREA AND FIELD \"CWATXTEX\"\n    IS SAVED AND THEN MODIFIED TO POINT TO THE EXIT LIST THAT POINTS TO\n    THE INTERNAL TEXT PROCESSING ENTRY IN IEFUJV (\"XJCLSCAN\").\n    IT SHOULD BE NOTED THAT THIS EXIT IS REPLETE WITH INSTALLATION\n    DEPENDENCIES SO THAT IT IS HIGHLY UNLIKELY THAT IT MAY BE INSTALLED\n    \"AS IS\" AT YOUR INSTALLATION WITH ANY DEGREE OF SATISFACTION. IT\n    MAY, HOWEVER, SERVE AS A MODEL FOR WRITING A SIMILIAR EXIT TO\n    PROCESS INTERNAL TEXT. THE SOURCE CODE IS, I BELIEVE, WELL\n    DOCUMENTED AND CONTAINS JUST ABOUT EVERY TYPE OF INTERNAL TEXT\n    MASSAGING IMAGINABLE, INCLUDING ADDING, DELETING, VERIFYING AND\n    MODIFYING INDIVIDUAL JCL PARAMETERS. IT ALSO HAS A ROUTINE, WHICH\n    USES THE MSGLEVEL PARAMETER TO CONTROL IT, TO PRINT THE CONTENTS\n    OF THE INTERNAL TEXT BUFFER, IN CHARACTER AND HEX, BEFORE AND\n    AFTER IEFUJV MODIFICATION, TO THE JES2 MESSAGE DATA SET.\n       I.E.

THERE IS NO COMMITTED MAINTENANCE PROGRAM FOR\n       DOCUMENTATION OR PROGRAM MATERIALS.\n\n NOTES:\n       JES2 LOGIC MODIFICATIONS - THE CHANGES TO JES ARE AS\n                            AS FOLLOWS:\n\n1. FIX 'XFRMTABN' IN MEMORY SO THAT ITS DJDE RECORDS MAY BE WRITTEN\n  DIRECTLY VIA EXCPVR. THERE MUST BE ONE TABLE FOR EACH 9700.\n\n  PLEASE NOTE THAT AN 'ORG' MUST BE USED TO ENSURE THAT NO RECORD\n  CROSSES A PAGE BOUNDARY.  EXCPVR WILL NOT CORRECTLY TRANSMIT A RECORD\n  RESIDENT IN TWO DIFFERENT PAGES.  AS PREVIOUSLY NOTED, MODULE\n  ALIGNMENT VIA THE 'PAGE' OPERAND OF THE LINKAGE EDITOR IS REQUIRED AS\n  WELL.\n\n  THE APPROPRIATE TABLE IS LOADED AND FIXED IN STORAGE.  THE TABLE WILL\n  BE DELETED WHENEVER THE PRINTER IS DRAINED AT JES.\n\n2.   AT EACH DATASET SELECTION, FIND THE FORM SPECIFIED IN THE CROSS\n  REFERENCE TABLE, EXTRACT THE FORM PART COUNT, MULTIPLY BY THE COPY\n  COUNT FROM THE JCL AND RESET THE COPY COUNT TO THE PRODUCT.  THE\n  DATASET WILL THEN BE TRANSMITTED TO THE 9700 THAT MANY TIMES.  ANY\n  FORM NOT FOUND IN THE TABLE WILL BE DEFAULTED AND PRINTED ON STANDARD\n  FORMS.\n\n  THE ENTRY ALSO CONTAINS A FLAG INDICATING WHETHER THE FORM IS ELIGIBLE\n  FOR DUPLEX PRINTING.  IF THE FLAG IS ON (ELIGIBLE) AND IF THE SYSOUT\n  CLASS BEING PROCESSED IS ELIGIBLE FOR DUPLEX (CLASS A AND D AS CODED),\n  THEN THE DUPLEX=YES RECORD WILL BE SENT.  IN ANY CASE, IF THE MODE\n  BEING ENTERED IS A CHANGE FROM THE CURRENT SETUP, THEN A MODE CHANGE\n  MESSAGE DJDE IS ISSUED.\n\n  THE ENTRY ALSO CONTAINS A STOCK INDEX BYTE, WHICH IS USED TO INDEX\n  INTO THE PAPER STOCK TABLE.  IF THE PAPER STOCK TO BE USED IS\n  DIFFERENT THAN THAT CURRENTLY IN USE, THE MESSAGE INDICATED BY THE\n  INDEX VALUE IS SENT AS DJDE FOR DISPLAY ON THE 9700 CONSOLE.\n\n  IF EITHER MESSAGE IS ISSUED, FOR A MODE CHANGE (DUPLEX/SIMPLEX) OR FOR\n  A PAPER STOCK CHANGE, A MESSAGE TO THE 9700 CONSOLE WILL BE ISSUED\n  WHICH WILL FORCE THE 9700 TO HALT PRINTING SO THE OPERATOR CAN MAKE\n  ANY SETUP CHANGES REQUIRED.\n\n  WHEN RUNNING IN DUPLEX MODE, SPECIAL MEASURES WERE NECESSARY TO ENSURE\n  THAT EACH DATASET BEGAN ON A PHYSICAL PAGE BOUNDARY.  THIS WAS\n  ESPECIALLY TRUE IF A MULTI-LOGICAL-IMAGE-PER-PAGE FORM (I.E.  2UP) WAS\n  BEING PRINTED.  SINCE CHANNEL 1 WOULD POSITION TO THE TOP OF A LOGICAL\n  PAGE, BUT NOT ALWAYS A PHYSICAL PAGE, IT WAS NECESSARY TO DEFINE A\n  CHANNEL WHICH WOULD ALWAYS BE DEFINED AS LINE 1, TOP OF FORM.  IN OUR\n  ENVIRONMENT CHANNEL 6 WAS FOUND TO NOT BE IN USE BY ANY EXISTING\n  REPORT AND WAS THEREFORE SELECTED.  IN ALL VFU SETS, CHANNEL 6 WAS\n  DEFINED AS LINE 1, AND A SKIP TO CHANNEL 6 WAS IN INSERTED IN THE\n  HASPPRPU CODE TO ENSURE THAT THE 9700 WAS POSITIONED AT TOP OF PAGE\n  WHEN THE COPIES=1 VERB IS RECEIVED.  THIS VERB WILL CAUSE THE 9700 TO\n  FURNISH A BLANK BACKSIDE IF NEEDED AND BEGIN PRINTING ON A NEW SHEET.\n\n3. APPLY 'SET' SEPARATOR PAGES BOUNDING EACH MULTIPLE- COPY SET, AND\n  'CPY' SEPARATOR PAGES BETWEEN EACH COPY.  SINGLE PART FORMS ARE SENT\n  WITH ONLY JOB SEPARATORS UNLESS A COPY COUNT GREATER THAN ONE HAS BEEN\n  SPECIFIED.\n\n4.  APPLY 'DJDE' SET AT EACH DATASET INITIALIZATION AND FOR EACH\n  TRAILING SEPARATOR.\n\n5.  ALLOW FCB/UCS LOADS FROM SYS1.IMAGELIB, BUT DEFAULT TO 8 LPI AND\n  P11 IF AN IMAGE IS NOT FOUND.  THE 9700 WILL, AS CODED, IGNORE ANY FCB\n  FROM THE CHANNEL; THE FCB FUNCTION IS REPLACED BY VFU DJDE COMMANDS\n  FROM THE FORM TABLE 'XFRMTABN'\n\n6.  ELIMINATE OPERATOR WAITS WHEN THE SETUP MESSAGE IS ISSUED AT FORM\n  CHANGE TIME (FORM=AUTOM MODE).  THE SETUP MESSAGE IS STILL ISSUED AS\n  INFORMATION TO THE OPERATOR.\n\n7. FORMAT A SEPARATOR PAGE MEETING INSTALLATION NEEDS AND REQUIREMENTS.\n\n8. DELETE ALL DJDE 9700 CONTROL RECORDS FROM THE PRINT DATA STREAM IF\n  THE PRINT IS BEING DIRECTED TO AN IMPACT PRINTER.\n\n9. DISABLE THE PRINTING OF 'NEWS'.  THE RE-POSITIONING OF THE JOB\n  SEPARATOR ROUTINE FORCED THE DISABLING OF THE 'NEWS' PRINT FEATURE.\n\n10. IDENTIFY THE 9700 PRINTER.  ALL 3211 PRINTERS ARE, IN THIS\n  VERSION, ASSUMED TO BE ACTUALLY XEROX 9700 PRINTERS.  IF YOUR SYSTEM\n  INCLUDES ONE OR MORE 3211S, THE TESTS FOR PRINTER DEVICE TYPE WILL\n  HAVE TO BE ALTERED ACCORDINGLY.\n\n********************************************************************************\n*                                                                              *\n*         F I L E   7 2   L A N E   J E S M O D S                              *\n*                                                                              *\n********************************************************************************\n\nTHIS FILE CONTAINS JESMODS FROM LANE COUNTY.\n\nQUESTIONS AND/OR COMMENTS SHOULD BE DIRECTED TO:\n\n                MEG GHENT\n                LANE COUNTY\n                125 EAST 8TH\n                EUGENE, OREGON, 97401\n\nTHE &PRTRANS JES2 INITIALIZATION PARAMETER IS USED TO SPECIFY WHETHER\nOR NOT LINES OF PRINT DIRECTED TO MOST PRINTERS ARE TO BE TRANSLATED\nBY JES2. IF TRANSLATION IS REQUESTED, THEN LOWER CASE LETTERS ARE\nCONVERTED TO UPPER CASE LETTERS AND INVALID CHARACTERS ARE CONVERTED\nTO BLANKS. THIS IS OBVIOUSLY A DESIRABLE OPTION FOR PRINTERS SUCH AS\nTHE 1403 THAT ARE UNABLE TO DEAL INTELLIGENTLY WITH LOWER CASE LETTERS.\nUNFORTUNATELY, THERE ARE DEVICES SUCH AS THE IBM 6670 THAT ARE SUPPORTED\nBY JES2 AS 2770S AND THEREFORE ARE GIVEN THE TREATMENT IMPLIED BY THE\n&PRTRANS PARAMETER. WHEREAS THE BEST CHOICE FOR A 1403 IS &PRTRANS=YES,\nTHE BEST CHOICE FOR A 6670 IS &PRTRANS=NO. BECAUSE OF THIS DILEMMA, WE\nIMPLEMENTED A JES2 MODIFICATION THAT ALLOWS US TO SPECIFY FOR EACH\nPRINTER WHETHER OR NOT TRANSLATION IS REQUIRED.\n\nEXTERNALLY, THE MODIFICATION CONSISTS OF SPECIFYING TRANS OR NOTRANS AS\nSUBPARAMETERS FOR THE JES2 PRINTERNN (LOCAL PRINTER) AND RNNN.PRM\n(REMOTE PRINTER) PARAMETERS. IF OMITTED, THE DEFAULT IS NOTRANS. THE\nIMPLEMENTATION ALSO REQUIRES THAT &PRTRANS=NO BE SPECIFIED; IF &PRTRANS\n=YES IS USED, PRINT IS TRANSLATED WITHOUT REGARD FOR THE TRANS/NOTRANS\nSUBPARAMETER.\n\nINTERNALLY, THIS IS ACCOMPLISHED BY ADDING SUPPORT TO HASPINIT FOR THE\nTRANS/NOTRANS SUBPARAMETER PAIR. AN EXISTING FLAG, (DCTRANS IN DCTPPFL)\nIS SET ON IF TRANS IS SPECIFIED, AND OFF IF NOTRANS IS SPECIFIED OR\nDEFAULTED. CHANGES TO HASPPRPU AND HASPRTAM ARE ALSO REQUIRED SO THAT\nTHEY WILL TEST THE FLAG TO DETERMINE WHETHER OR NOT TO TRANSLATE A\nPRINT LINE.\n\nTHE FLAG USED FOR THE TRANS/NOTRANS SUBPARAMETER WAS DEFINED IN THE DCT,\nBUT NOT REFERENCED BY ANY JES2 MODULES. THE COMMENT 'PRINTER TRANSLATION\nSPECIFIED' ON THE DEFINITION OF THE DCTRANS FLAG MAKES IT APPEAR THAT\nTHIS IMPLEMENTATION MAY MERELY PRECEDE A FUTURE IBM ENHANCEMENT FOR JES2\n\n********************************************************************************\n*                                                                              *\n*         F I L E   7 3   L L O Y D S   J E S M O D S                          *\n*                                                                              *\n********************************************************************************\n\nTHIS TAPE CONTAINS ALL USER MODS IN USE AT LLOYDS BANK CALIFORNIA.\nNOT ALL OF THESE USERMODS ARE STILL IN USE.

LAST FILE UPDATE - APRIL 1981\n\nMOD DESCRIPTION:\n     ENHANCEMENT TO DISPOSITION PROCESSING MESSAGES IEF283I,IEF285I,\n     AND IEF287I.  THE MESSAGE LINE THAT GIVES THE DATA SET NAME AND\n     DISPOSITION HAS BEEN EXTENDED TO INCLUDE THE DDNAME AND I/O COUNT\n     OF THE DATA SET.  THE I/O COUNT IS DISPLAYED IN THE FORMATS:\n       (1) CARDS=NNNNNNN      FOR SYSIN AND SYSOUT=B DATA SETS\n       (2) LINES=NNNNNNN      FOR SYSOUT DATA SETS EXCEPT SYSOUT=B\n       (3) EXCPS=NNNNNNN      FOR ALL OTHER DATA SETS\n     THERE IS NO SUPPORT FOR INTERNAL READER I/O COUNTS; THEIR I/O\n     COUNT WILL ALWAYS SHOW AS LINES=0000000  .  THE MESSAGE EXTENSION\n     WILL NOT BE SHOWN FOR DATA SETS WHOSE PROCESSING TASK DOES NOT\n     HAVE A TIMING CONTROL TABLE, I.E., THOSE NOT HAVING SMF STATISTICS\n     GATHERED.\n\nMOD NOTES:\n     THE ENHANCEMENT CONSISTS OF EXPAND/ZAPS TO TWO UNALLOCATION\n     MODULES (IEFAB4B0,IEFAB4A2) AND SOURCE UPDATES TO HASPSSSM.  THE\n     MODIFICATION IS GIVEN IN SMP4 FORMAT AS TWO USERMODS.\n\n     THE HASPSSSM UPDATE IS TO UNALLOCATION PROCESSING (HOSUNAL). ITS\n     PURPOSE IS TO PLACE JES2 DATA SET COUNTS IN THE TIMING CONTROL\n     I/O TABLE DEVICE ENTRY FOR THE DD ENTRY CORRESPONDING TO THE\n     DATA SET BEING UNALLOCATED.\n\n     THE SUPERZAP TO IEFAB4A2 PUTS THE ADDRESS OF THE PROBLEM PROGRAM\n     JSCB INTO THE JFCBDSCB FIELD OF THE UNALLOCATED JES2 DATA SET.\n     HASPSSSM USES THIS INFORMATION TO DETERMINE THE ADDRESS OF THE\n     PROBLEM PROGRAM TIOT (NOT NORMALLY AVAILABLE AT STEP UNALLOCATION\n     TIME) .\n\n     THE SUPERZAP TO IEFAB4B0 FORMATS THE MESSAGE EXTENSION BY USING\n     INFORMATION IN THE TIOT AND TCT I/O TABLE.\n\n     THE THREE MODULE UPDATES CAN BE PUT ONTO THE SYSTEM INDEPENDENTLY,\n     THEY ARE NOT COREQUISITES OF EACH OTHER.  HOWEVER, PARTIAL OR NO\n     ENHANCEMENT INFORMATION WILL RESULT.\n\n     THE OPERATING SYSTEM AT TOYOTA IS MVS 3.8 WITH SU64, PUT\n     TAPE 8005, JES2 R4.1.

A SUPERZAP STATEMENT THAT\n          DIRECTLY USES THIS DEPENDENCY IS MARKED AS SUCH IN ITS\n          COMMENT FIELD.\n     (2)  THE JFCBDSCB FIELD IS MODIFIED FOR JES2 DATA SETS.  THIS\n          FIELD IS NOT CURRENTLY BEING USED FOR JES2 DATA SETS BY\n          BIG BLUE.\n     (3)  CARE MUST BE EXERCISED IN APPLYING THE SUPERZAPS TO IEFAB4A2\n          AND IEFAB4B0.  THE REP OFFSETS SHOULD ONLY HIT THE EXPANDED\n          AREAS OF THE MODULES; CHECK MODULE LENGTHES BEFORE APPLYING\n          THE SUPERZAPS.

This includes      |\n   LOCATE, DYNALLOC, and SYNADAF information as well as      |\n   validity checking of HCT variables and Spool MTTR's.      |\n - The external entry points are:                            |\n     JESINIT - The initialization routine.                   |\n     JESFREE - The clean-up routine.                         |\n     JESCKPT - The JES2 Checkpoint read routine.             |\n     JESREAD - The Spool read routine.                       |\n     JESDATA - A data area mapped by the JSPLDATA macro.     |\n     JESHCT  - A dummy HCT built by the JESINIT entry which  |\n               provides access to the Checkpoint information.|\n-------------------------------------------------------------+---------\nTICKETS is the front-end of a program which reads the JES2   | TICKETS\nCheckpoint and Spool data sets using the JESSPOOL routines,  |\nand generates job setup tickets. The TICKETS program has its |\nown checkpoint data set to keep track of which jobs have had |\nsetup tickets produced. Restart capabilities include job     |\nnumber ranges, time of day requests, and an automatic warm   |\nstart capability. The TICKETS front-end can also be used to  |\nlist the JES2 Log, the input JCL, the expanded JCL, and the  |\nsystem messages for a given job, started task, or TSO user.  |\nThe front-end does not format or print job setup tickets;    |\nthis is done by the TIFSUB (Tickets Interface SUBroutine) or |\nby routines called from TIFSUB. The interface consists of    |\na single entry point which is used to receive a 'Call Code'  |\nwhich identifies the remainder of the parameter list. The    |\nTICKETS front-end uses return codes from the TIFSUB to direct|\nfuther processing. The TIFSUB can be coded in either FORTRAN |\nor assembler. The 'Call Codes' indicate one of the following:|\n  Initialization - Called once at the beginning of the run.  |\n  New Job - Called when processing begins for a new job      |\n    setup ticket.                                            |\n  Internal Text - Called once for each internal text record  |\n    for a job. Spanned records are assembled into a single   |\n    record before calling TIFSUB. An end-of-file call is     |\n    made after all internal text records for a job have been |\n    processed.                                               |\n  Input JCL - Called once for each input JCL record. An      |\n    End-of-file call is made after the last JCL record has   |\n    been processed.                                          |\n  End of JOB - Called at the end of processing for a each    |\n    job setup ticket.                                        |\n  End of Run - Called after all job setup tickets for the    |\n    current run have been processed.                         |\n  Abort Job - Called to abort the processing of a job setup  |\n    ticket when an internal text or JCL buffer has an invalid|\n    job key, DSID, or is not formatted correctly. Processing |\n    resumes with the next job setup ticket.                  |\nThe TIFSUB can request the following via return codes:       |\n  - Continue with normal processing.                         |\n  - Abort the current job setup ticket without comment.      |\n  - Abort the current job setup and flag the job in error.   |\n  - Request that no more calls be made for internal text     |\n    records for the current job setup ticket.                |\n  - Request that no more calls be made for input JCL records |\n    for the current job setup ticket.                        |\n  - Request the TICKETS front-end to take an ABEND Dump.     |\nThe TICKETS front-end formats and presents error information |\nreturned from the JESSPOOL routines as well as providing a   |\nnumber of its own diagnostics.                               |\n-------------------------------------------------------------+---------\nTwo test versions of the TIFSUB routine (see TICKETS above)  | TIFSUBA\nare provided; one in assembler and the other in FORTRAN.     | TIFSUBF\n-------------------------------------------------------------+---------\nIt purges jobs from the JES2 Job Queue which have remained   |\nin the system for more than a specified number of days since |\nthe job began output processing, or if no output processor   |\ntime stamp is available, the number of days since the job    |\nended execution. The program can operate in either TEST or   |\nCANCEL mode, the diference being whether or not the jobs are |\nactually purged via subsystem cancel requests. An audit trail|\nis provided in the form of WTO messages which give the job   |\nnumber, jobname, and age of the job's output for each job    |\nwhich is purged. The program includes numerous validity      |\nchecks and any problems are brought to the OPERATOR's        |\nattention via WTO messages.                                  |\n-------------------------------------------------------------+---------\nOperator documentation for JES2 Checkpoint problems          | DOCCKPT\n-------------------------------------------------------------+---------\nOperator documentation for local JES2 commands               | DOCJCMDS\n-------------------------------------------------------------+---------\nThe HASP Merge program and its documentation from the        | NIHPROSE\nNational Institute of Health (NIH) are included since        | HSPMERGE\nthe ONL JES2 mods are in NIH HASP Merge format.              |\n-------------------------------------------------------------+---------\nAccounting mods:                                             | ONL$ACC\n - A five digit account number is supported.                 |\n - The account number is saved in part of the JCTUSEID.      |\n - Room number is not required even when the account number  |\n   is required by &RJOBOPT.                                  |\n - Job card accounting is forced for TSO Logons.             |\n-------------------------------------------------------------+---------\nThe $A command has been modified so that jobs awaiting       | ONL$AJHJ\nexecution may be forced to execute on a specified system     | $AJHJMAC\nwhen released. A warning message will be issued if a job is  |\nreleased to a system which cannot execute the job because    |\nof a system affinity or resource conflict.                   |\n-------------------------------------------------------------+---------\nThe $A command has been modified to prevent RJE operators    | ONL$ARJE\nfrom releasing setup jobs awaiting execution. Jobs in those  | $ARJEMAC\nclasses whose Class Attribute Table (CAT) entry indicates    |\nTYPRUN=HOLD are considered setup jobs. If a command is       |\nentered from an RJE to release a setup job, the following    |\nmessage will be issued:                                      |\n     \"NOT RELEASED, AWAITING EXEC SETUP\"                     |\n-------------------------------------------------------------+---------\nEliminates the punching of blank cards at the end of punched | ONL$BCRD\ndata sets at selected remotes.                               | $BCRDMAC\n-------------------------------------------------------------+---------\nExpands the JQE and QSE control blocks. A cold-start is      | ONL$BLKS\nrequired. After that, mods which require the additional      |\nspace may be installed without futher cold-starts.           |\n-------------------------------------------------------------+---------\nThis mod is used to compute the job class. Features include: | ONL$CLSC\n - Support for a '//*CLASS' control card.                    | $CLSCMAC\n - Add/Change the PERFORM parameter in the internal text for | HASPZCAL\n   JOB statments.                                            |\n - The internal text for JOB statements may be updated-in-   |\n   place after the conversion subtask is done.               |\n - The internal text is scanned to determine the largest     |\n   region used by a job. REGION overrides are handled.       |\n - Occurrences of TIME=1440 in the internal text for batch   |\n   jobs is changed to TIME=1439.                             |\n - The ADDRSPC=VIRT parameter is added to the internal text  |\n   of job statements for non-privileged job classes.         |\n-------------------------------------------------------------+---------\nThe $COMWORK macro has been expanded to include a 10 word    | ONL$COMW\nwork area for use by other local mods to HASPCOMM.           |\n-------------------------------------------------------------+---------\nCommands of the form $v'jobname have been modified to allow  | ONL$DN1\na partial Jobname to be specified.                           |\n-------------------------------------------------------------+---------\nThe $EJ command has been modified to perform the same        | ONL$EJCH\nfunction as a $EJ-$HJ-$CJ command sequence. If a job is not  | $EJCHMAC\nrestartable across warm-starts because of JES2 initialization|\ndefaults or because RESTART=N was specified on a JOBPARM     |\ncontrol statement, then a message saying \"NOT RESTARTABLE AT |\nUSER'S REQUEST\" will be issued.                              |\n-------------------------------------------------------------+---------\nThe visibility of the \"JOB ENDED\" message ($HASP395) is      | ONL$ENDM\nenhanced so that operators will see the message and take     |\nappropriate action.                                          |\n-------------------------------------------------------------+---------\nThis mod allows operators to control RJE Line Error Logging  | ONL$LERR\nby using a $TCON,0,TP command to turn-on error logging and a | $LERRMAC\n$TCON,15,TP command to turn-off line error logging. A Master |\nConsole Informational route code was added to the $DMR...    |\ncommand to prevent the loss of messages from RJE's.          |\n-------------------------------------------------------------+---------\nSupport has been added to support a /*RELAY control statement| DOCRELAY\nfor transmitting unit record data sets. The /*RELAY control  | ONL$RLY\nstatement's main advantage over TYPRUN=COPY is that it can   | $RLYMAC\ntransmit anything ... and without modification. All card     |\nimages following the /*RELAY statement are transmitted until |\nan end-of-file is reached on the input device. The code is   |\nmodeled after TUC's RELAY mod but has been expanded in scope.|\nIf any errors are found in the /*RELAY statement, the illegal|\n/*RELAY card image and associated error messages will be     |\nprinted at the default destination for the input device. The |\nformat of the /*RELAY statement is:                          |\n                                                             |\n/*RELAY  PRINT  destination   jobname   account#   pgmr-name |\n         PUNCH                                               |\n-------------------------------------------------------------+---------\nThe Resource Routing Mod allows a job using a '/*ROUTE XEQ   | ONL$RSRT\nresource' control statement to specify from a set of resource| $RSRTMAC\nnames, those resources which must be attached to a given CPU | $RSRTTAB\nbefore the job can execute on that CPU. The code was modeled |\nafter Mellon Bank's Resource Routing mod, however, it bears  |\nvery little resemblance to their mod. This re-write was      |\nnecessitated by a number of problems encountered in the      |\nMellon mod (esp. in HASPCOMM) and by the desire to eliminate |\nadditional unwanted features integrated into the Mellon mod. |\n-------------------------------------------------------------+---------\nThis is yet another (yes, another) separator page/card mod.  | ONL$SEP\nOne novel feature about this mod is that separator lines for | $SEPMAC\nnarrow forms, e.g. mailing labels, are rotated one position  |\nto the left on each succeeding line so that all the separator|\ninformation will be printed on the form.                     |\n-------------------------------------------------------------+---------\nPrevent the use of SYSOUT Classes which have been declared as| ONL$SYSO\n'ILLEGAL' by a new keyword on the $$x (SYSOUT Class) JES2    | $SYSOMAC\nInitialization parameter.                                    |\n=============================================================#=========\n********************************************************************************\n*                                                                              *\n*         F I L E   7 7    L O C K H E E D   S P 2   M O D S                   *\n*                                                                              *\n********************************************************************************\n\nTHE FOLLOWING MODS ARE SUPPLIED BY LOCKHEED CO.

These halves can be printed on two adjacent 12\n             LPI lines to form complete characters.  At the same time GF15\n             or GFC characters can be placed on the same lines allowing\n             two lines of 12 LPI characters on the \"same\" line as one line\n             of 6 LPI Gothic characters.  Note that the cent sign (\u00a2) has\n             been re-defined as a \"pseudo-blank\" to provide for 10 CPI\n             blanks.\n   CHARGR    IEBIMAGE input to produce CHARS=G10R, G12R & G15R which are\n             white Gothic letters on a black background.  These characters\n             are only suitable for isolated spots on a printed page as too\n             large a concentration of \"blackness\" will cause your output\n             to fade.  The cent sign (\u00a2) has been re-defined as a\n             \"pseudo-blank\" to provide for \"black\" blanks.\n   CHARGE    IEBIMAGE input to produce CHARS=GE10, GE12 & GE15 which are\n             Gothic letters with faint eyescan lines below each character.\n             An entire page printed using these characters gives the\n             impression that the page was ruled side to side with faint\n             lines.  As with underscoring these faint lines are not\n             visible at 12 LPI.  The cent sign (\u00a2) has been re-defined as\n             a \"pseudo-blank\" to provide for \"underlined\" blanks.\n   FCBGE     IEBIMAGE input to produce FCB=8580 & 8584 which are 3800\n             Printer FCBs that intermix 8 & 12 LPI.  These FCBs are named\n             so that the first 2 characters indicate the page depth\n             whereas the second 2 characters indicate the number of lines\n             per page.  When one of these FCBs is used with GE15 the\n             eyescan lines are visible ONLY on the 8 LPI lines thereby\n             producing intermittent eyescan lines down the page.  For\n             example, when using FCB 8584, 12 eyescan lines appear, spaced\n             at 5/8\" intervals.  This provides a simple method to simulate\n             lined paper without special programming or form flashes.\n   CHARGS13  IEBIMAGE input to produce CHARS=GS13 & GS11.  These C.A.T.\n             are used with PGM=PRNTGS13 to produce simulated 13.3 & 11\n             CPI printing on the 3800 Printer.\n   PRNTGS13  A PL/1 program to produce simulated 13.3 & 11 CPI printing.\n             The following table provides the print line character\n             capacities for several 3800 Printer form widths:\n                  Paper Width     11 pitch     13.3 pitch\n                     9.5\"             92            113\n                      11\"            109            133\n                      12\"            120            146\n                    14.875\"          148            181\n             The input data set can contain fixed length, variable length\n             or undefined length records.  CC must be specified in the\n             PARM string as M (machine carriage control characters) or N\n             (no carriage control characters) if the default of A (ANSI\n             carriage control characters) is not acceptable.  The\n             simulated pitch produced depends on the CHARS specified on\n             SYSUT2.  Either 6 or 8 LPI can be used with the supplied\n             characters.  This program is useful for printing reports\n             designed for a line printer (i.e. 132 characters wide) on 11\"\n             wide paper as it provides larger characters than the usual\n             GF15 or GFC for such reports.\n   JCLGS13   A sample job stream containing a suggested catalogued\n             procedure for using PGM=PRNTGS13.\n   CHARMG12  IEBIMAGE imput to produce CHARS=MG12.  These are Greek\n             text characters (the same ones as in MC12).\n   CHARMC12  IEBIMAGE imput to produce CHARS=MC12.  This character\n             arrangement table contains text, Greek text and mathematical\n             characters.\n   DESCMC12  An article from our local computing publication (\"ISD\n             Newsletter\") describing the contents of CHARS=MC12 and the\n             usage of a special Fortran program written to compose\n             documents using these characters.\n   E02ATEXT  The Fortran program with CLG JCL and sample input data.  See\n             the comments in the program for more information.  This\n             program may be useful if you don't have something like\n             SCRIPT/VS.\n   CHARLIST  A Fortran program with CLG JCL to produce a one page document\n             used with E02ATEXT.\n   CHARBITS  A Fortran program with CLG JCL to produce a several page\n             document describing each character in MC12.\n        I am the author of everything except the TSO SYSOUT command and\n   the Greek & mathematical character related items.  The latter were\n   programmed by Mitchell Choukalos of Alberta Environment, another\n   department of the Government of Alberta.

If     |\n   this occurs, the Checkpoint data set will be re-read      |\n   until a valid copy is obtained or a specified number of   |\n   re-reads have been performed.                             |\n - The JESSPOOL routines can operate with missing spool      |\n   volumes including the primary spool volume.  Normally,    |\n   only the volumes which were in use at the last JES2 Nodal |\n   Warm-Start will be used.  However, at the user's request, |\n   JESSPOOL will attempt to use all spools in existence.  If |\n   this option is chosen, the user may also request that     |\n   Return codes not be set when volumes which were not       |\n   useable at the last JES2 Nodal Warm-Start are still       |\n   unuseable.                                                |\n - Dynamic Allocation is used; no DD statements are required.|\n - Any Count-Key-Data type direct access device is supported.|\n - If for some reason, a problem developed with the check-   |\n   point or spool volumes and the names of the spool volumes |\n   were CLIPPED, the user could specify the first five       |\n   characters of the renamed spool volumes and use these     |\n   routines as part of a postmortem or recovery program.     |\n - The JESSPOOOL entry points are:                           |\n     JESSPOOL- Builds the JESDATA area mapped by the JESDATA |\n               macro and is used to communicate between the  |\n               caller and the JESSPOOL entry points.         |\n     JESALOC - Allocates the JES2 Checkpoint and Spool data  |\n               sets and performs the first read of the JES2  |\n               Checkpoint data set.                          |\n     JESFREE - Releases all resources held by the JESSPOOL   |\n               routines.                                     |\n     JESCKPT - Reads the JES2 Checkpoint data set.           |\n     JESREAD - Reads a record from the JES2 Spool.           |\n     JESRJCT - Reads a JCT from the JES2 Spool.              |\n-------------------------------------------------------------+---------\nThe QPURGE program runs as a started task under MVS/JES2.    | QPURGE\nIt purges jobs from the JES2 Job Queue which have remained   |\nin the system for more than a specified number of days since |\nthe job began output processing, or if no output processor   |\ntime stamp is available, the number of days since the job    |\nended execution.  The program can operate in either TEST or  |\nCANCEL mode, the diference being whether or not the jobs are |\nactually purged via subsystem cancel requests.  An audit     |\ntrail is provided in the form of WTO messages which give the |\njob number, jobname, and age of the job's output for each    |\njob which is purged.  The program includes numerous validity |\nchecks and any problems are brought to the operator's        |\nattention via WTO messages.                                  |\n=============================================================#=========\n********************************************************************************\n*                                                                              *\n*         F I L E   8 3    O N L   W O R K S T A T I O N                       *\n*                                                                              *\n********************************************************************************\n\nThe following is an abstract of the HASP Remote Terminal Programs\nsupplied by the Oak Ridge National Laboratory:\n\nSHARE Installation Code = ONL\n\nInstallation Contact = Robert M.

OF 8 CHARACTERS)\n                   3. 18 LINES OF JES2-STYLE SEPARATOR LINES, EACH LINE\n                      CONTAINING SYSOUT CLASS, JOB NUMBER, JOB NAME,\n                      PROGRAMMER NAME, JOB TITLE, CPU ID, DAY OF WEEK,\n                      DATE AND TIME PRINTED.\n                   4. 10 LINES CONTAINING 'JWT' IN BLOCK LETTERS IN THE\n                      CENTER, WITH BOXES ON EITHER SIDE.  THE LEFT BOX\n                      DESCRIBES THE PRINTING LOCATION.  THE RIGHT BOX\n                      CONTAINS DELIVERY INFORMATION.\n                   JOB TITLE IS AN OPTIONAL FIELD TAKEN FROM THE SECOND\n                   POSITIONAL PARAMETER IN THE JOB CARD ACCOUNTING\n                   FIELD.  IF IT IS NOT PRESENT ON THE JOB CARD, IT IS\n                   LEFT BLANK ON THE HEADER PAGE.  THE IDEA IS THAT JOB\n                   NAMES OFTEN CANNOT BE MEANINGFUL BECAUSE THEY MUST\n                   CONFORM TO RULES, SO PROVISION IS MADE FOR A TITLE\n                   TO IDENTIFY THE LISTING.  DELIVERY INSTRUCTIONS ARE\n                   TABLE-DRIVEN, BASED ON A 4-CHARACTER DELIVERY CODE\n                   WHICH IS THE THIRD POSITIONAL PARAMETER IN THE JOB\n                   CARD ACCOUNTING FIELD.  IT, TOO, IS OPTIONAL.  IF\n                   IT IS NOT PRESENT, THE BOX IS LEFT BLANK.  PRINT\n                   LOCATION (LEFT BOX) IS TABLE-DRIVEN.\n\n QJ00005  IATUX23  MODIFICATION TO JOB TRAILER (BURST) PAGE TO\n                   REPLACE SKIP TO CHANNEL 12 WITH SKIP 2 LINES.\n                   (APPLIES ONLY TO IMPACT PRINTERS.)\n                   ATTEMPTING TO SKIP TO CHANNEL 12 ON A 1403\n                   PRINTER WHICH DOES NOT HAVE A CHANNEL 12 PUNCH\n                   ON ANY OF ITS PAPER CARRIAGE CONTROL TAPES\n                   IS NOT A GOOD IDEA.\n\n QJ00006  IATUX06  ENFORCE JWT DASD ALLOCATION STANDARDS FOR AS TO\n                   WHERE NEW DASD DATASETS ARE ALLOWED TO BE PLACED\n                   (EXCLUDING DYNAMIC ALLOCATIONS).

NEITHER\n          FMC NOR THE AUTHOR SHALL BE HELD LIABLE FOR ANY PROBLEMS\n          THAT MAY RESULT FROM THE USE OF THESE PROGRAMS.\n\n   NOTES:\n      1.  SAMPLE SMPE SYSMOD IN MEMBER JJECL00 MAY BE USED TO INSTALL\n          MOST OF THE BRIDGE.  IT INCLUDES EVERYTHING EXCEPT FOR THE\n          PARTS OF THE BRIDGE THAT MUST BE ADDED TO IATUX28, IATUX29,\n          IATUX33, IATUX34, IATUX44, AND IATUX03.\n\n      2.  THE INPUT SERVICE EXITS (28, 29, 33, 34, 44) AND IATUX03 ARE\n          INCLUDED IN THIER ENTIRETY.  ALL OF THE CODE IN IATUX03 IS\n          NEEDED FOR THE BRIDGE, BUT THE OTHER EXITS CONTAIN SOME\n          UNRELATED STUFF (E.G., CALLS TO ACF2).  YOU SHOULD REVIEW\n          ALL OF THESE EXITS CAREFULLY BEFORE USING THEM.\n\n      3.  SAMPLE SMPE SYSMOD IN MEMBER JIWJM00 MAY BE USED TO INSTALL\n          THE JESMSG MESSAGE WRITING PROGRAM, IATIWJM, AND IT'S\n          ASSOCIATED MACROS.\n\n      4.  CAUTION - I HAVE TRIED TO MAKE ALL COMMENTS IN THE SOURCE\n          CODE MEANINGFUL.  WHEN IN DOUBT, LOOK AT THE CODE RATHER THAN\n          THE COMMENTS.\n\n      5.  WARNING - THE CODE SUPPLIED USES CERTAIN FIELDS IN THE INPUT\n          SERVICE DATA CSECT THAT ARE RESERVED FOR THE USER.  THE FIELDS\n          USED ARE ISFLAG8 AND ISDRSVU1.  IATUX03 USES A FIELD IN THE\n          CI DSP DATA CSECT.  THE FIELD USED IS IDDRSUSR (8 WORDS).\n\n      6.  CONVERSION OF REMOTE NAMES AND NODE NAMES MUST BE CAREFULLY\n          REVIEWED BY ANYONE INSTALLING THE BRIDGE.  THE ROUTINES FOR\n          CONVERTING DESTINATION NAMES IN IATJ33X AND IATUX03 ARE\n          SPECIFIC TO FMC.  AT THE LEAST, THE NODENAME TABLES WILL\n          NEED TO BE CHANGED TO REFLECT THE NAMES OF YOUR NODES.\n\n      7.  GENERAL FUNCTION OF EACH MEMBER IS AS FOLLOWS:\n\n          ** MACROS **\n\n          FMCJCB   - DSECT OF JECL CONVERSION BRIDGE WORK AREA\n          FMCOJP   - DSECT OF OUTPUT JCL PARAMETER BLOCK\n          FMCSJAR  - DSECT OF SMF JECL BRIDGE ACTIVITY RECORD\n          FMCXIS   - DSECT OF INPUT SERVICE EXIT COMMON CONTROL BLOCK\n          ISWJMWT  - CALL JESMSG MESSAGE FORMAT/WRITE ROUTINE (IATIWJM)\n          ISWJVAR  - CONSTRUCT SEGMENT LIST FOR IATIWJM\n\n          ** MODULES **\n\n          IATIWJM  - FORMAT AND WRITE MESSAGES TO JESMSG DATASET\n          IATJECL  - BRIDGE ROUTING MODULE.  CALLED BY EXITS 33, 34,\n                     44, AND 29.  THIS MODULE CALLS THE APPROPRIATE\n                     CONVERSION MODULE (IATJ33X, IATJ34X, IATJ44X) AND\n                     WRITES THE SMF RECORD WHEN CALLED BY IATUX29.  THE\n                     SMF RECORD IS ONLY WRITTEN FOR JOBS THAT REQUIRED\n                     SOME BRIDGE ACTIVITY.\n          IATJ33X  - THE HEART OF THE CONVERSION BRIDGE.  J33X DOES\n                     ALL OF THE JECL STATEMENT CONVERSIONS.  SOME\n                     CONVERTED CARDS ARE INSERTED IMMEDIATELY, WHILE\n                     OTHERS, SUCH AS //*MAIN AND OUTPUT JCL STATEMENTS,\n                     ARE NOT INSERTED UNTIL THE FIRST EXEC OR INSTREAM\n                     PROC IS FOUND.\n          IATJ34X  - SCANS DD STATEMENTS FOR SYSOUT OPERAND.  WHEN A\n                     SYSOUT DD IS FOUND THAT CONTAINS 3 SUBPARMS, THE\n                     THIRD IS CHECKED FOR A POSSIBLE MATCH WITH A JES2\n                     /*OUTPUT CODENAME.  WHEN A MATCH OCCURS, IATJ34X\n                     CHANGES THE SYSOUT OPERAND TO A SIMPLE CLASS\n                     REFERENCE (E.G., SYSOUT=(A,,ABC) ==> SYSOUT=A), AND\n                     INSERTS A CARD WITH AN OUTPUT JCL REFERENCE,\n                     E.G.,  //  OUTPUT=(*.ABC).  NOTE THAT PROCS ARE\n                     NOT EXPANDED AT INPUT SERVICE TIME, SO ANY SYSOUT\n                     REFERENCE TO A JES2 /*OUTPUT CARD IN A PROC WILL\n                     NOT BE CONVERTED TO AN OUTPUT JCL REFERENCE UNTIL\n                     THE INTERNAL TEXT IS BUILT AND PASSED TO IATUX03.\n          IATJ44X  - LOOKS FOR AN INSTREAM PROC WITHIN THE JOB.  IF AN\n                     INSTREAM PROC IS FOUND, IT SETS A FLAG THAT TELLS\n                     IATJ33X TO START INSERTING STATEMENTS.\n          IATUX28  - INITIALIZES THE INPUT SERVICE EXIT COMMON CONTROL\n                     BLOCK (XIS).  THIS IS THE FIRST INPUT SERVICE EXIT\n                     CALLED.\n          IATUX29  - FREES THE INPUT SERVICE EXIT COMMON CONTROL BLOCK\n                     (XIS).  CALLS IATJECL TO CLEANUP AND WRITE SMF\n                     RECORD.  THIS IS THE LAST INPUT SERVICE EXIT.\n          IATUX33  - JECL STATEMENT SCAN.  CALLS IATJECL FOR EACH JECL\n                     STATEMENT RECEIVED.\n          IATUX34  - DD STATEMENT SCAN.  CALLS IATJECL FOR EACH DD\n                     STATEMENT RECEIVED.\n          IATUX44  - SJF AND OTHER JCL STATEMENT SCAN.  CALLS IATJECL\n                     FOR EACH STATEMENT RECEIVED.\n          IATUX03  - INTERNAL TEXT EXIT FROM CI.  THIS EXIT CONVERTS\n                     SYSOUT DD STATEMENTS THAT REFERENCE A JES2\n                     /*OUTPUT CARD TO AN OUTPUT JCL REFERENCE.  EXIT 3\n                     WILL CONVERT ANY /*OUTPUT CARD REFERENCE THAT WAS\n                     NOT CONVERTED IN IATJ34X.\n\n      8.

TSSO performs its function through two integrated\n   components. The Operator  Productivity  Facility (OPF) extends the\n   power of TSO to the MVS opera- tor's  console,  and  the Automated\n   Operations  Facility  (AOF) enhances an installation's ability to\n   control system events based on  console message traffic.  TSSO also\n   enhances end-user productivity by allowing end-user access to the MVS\n   command  subsystem.  This  document  describes the installation of\n   TSSO, TSSO parameters, and the use of the two components.\n\n   A guide to the new features of TSSO Version 4, Release 3 is in member\n   RELGDE42 in this dataset.\n\n   Anyone with an interest in automated operations is invited to look\n   at TSSO as a software tool providing many of the primitives required\n   for common automated operations tasks.  These primitives include\n   highlighting, lowlighting, replying and reacting to operating system\n   messages, in addition to the ability to issue a command and retrieve\n   the response in CLIST variables.\n\n   Questions about TSSO may be referred to Marc Schare at\n   (201) 699-2796\n\n*---------------------------------------------------------------------*\n**FILE017          ROCKWELL INTERNATIONAL                  7/29/87    *\n*---------------------------------------------------------------------*\n\n ROCKWELL INTERNATIONAL JES3 SP 1.3.4 USER MODIFICATIONS\n\n THESE MODIFICATIONS ARE SUBMITTED ON AN ASIS BASIS AND ARE\n GUARENTEED TO WORK ONLY IN A ROCKWELL ENVIRONMENT.

FORCE PROPER PROCLIB BASED ON JOB DESCRIPTOR CLASS.  THIS\n       MOD HAS THE SAME EFFECT AS PLACING A //*MAIN PROCID=XX\n       CARD IN THE JOB'S JCL.  WHILE THIS CODE IS CHUBB SPECIFIC\n       (IN THAT IT USES CHUBB JDC'S AND PROCLIBS), IT WILL SHOW\n       YOU HOW IT CAN BE DONE.  ALSO INCLUDED IN THIS MOD IS CODE\n       THAT CAUSES JES3 TO IGNORE ANY VALUE EXCEPT 0 THAT IS CODED\n       IN THE PRTY PARAMETER OF THE JOB CARD (WHICH FORCES USE OF THE\n       DEFAULTS IN THE JES3 INISH DECK).  THIS MOD UPDATES IATISJB AND\n       IS CONTAINED IN MEMBER CH10140.\n\n   5.  SYSOUT DATASET DIRECTORY FOR BATCH JOBS.  THIS GROUP OF MODS\n       PUTS A DIRECTORY OF THE SYSOUT DATASETS CREATED BY A JOB INTO THE\n       JOB'S JESMGS DATASET.  THE DIRECTORY SHOWS A DATASET'S DDNAME,\n       DESTINATION, FORMS, CARRAIGE, LINES, COPIES, AND SYSOUT CLASS.\n       IN ALSO SHOWS A \"LOCATION\" FIELD FOR EACH DATASET., WHICH IS\n       PART OF ANOTHER CHUBB MODIFICATION.  AS A RESULT, YOU WILL HAVE\n       TO REMOVE THE CODE FOR \"LOCATION\" TO USE THIS IN YOUR\n       INSTALLATION.
