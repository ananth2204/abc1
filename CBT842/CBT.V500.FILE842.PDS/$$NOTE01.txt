Hi Sam,

Hope all is well with you and your family.

Attached is an updated version of file 842.  I have added the
capacity to edit (in ISPF) the selection list to remove any
datasets that one may not want to be processed.  If you have any
questions please don't hesitate to contact me.

Regards,
Roger
