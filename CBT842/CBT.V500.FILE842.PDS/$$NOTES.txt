I like to have some backup copies of important datasets at DR and
also just to have some copies off the system.  I really like the Xmit
Manager utility by Neal Johnston-Ward to view or copy individual
members as required on a pc.  So I wrote this rather simple utility
to use the transmit (XMIT) facility of TSO to backup up PDS, PDSE,
and sequential datasets by HLQs.  In order to accomodate Xmit
Manager's not being able to see all members of a PDSE, the utility
copies the PDSE to a PDS with the same dataset attributes. (A caveat
here is the inability to copy some PDSE load libraries to a PDS, but
you probably don't need to view them anyways. If you really want or
need a backup copy, you will need to manually create the XMIT
dataset. If you follow the naming scheme it will be ftp'ed along with
the other datasets.)  In addition the tool copies VB datasets to FB
so you can view them in usable format with Xmit Manager.  It also
copies sequential datasets to a common name format, for the ease of
FTPing.

Added Rexx to perform foreground dataset search and put results into an
edit panel. This will allow you to delete any datasets from the
selection that you do not really want. Instructions for use of
SELCTDSN are :

/****************************************************************/
/*                   Select Dataset Display                     */
/*  displays dataset names and basic attributes in edit panel   */
/*  Usage -                                                     */

Installation and usage:
*********************************************************************

Copy XMITALL, DSLISTB, SELCTDSN, and LMCOPY to a REXX EXEC dataset of
your choice and change the dataset name on the SYSEXEC DDs in XMITJOBs
and XMITALL or they can be left in the current dataset.

In XMITJOB(s) , of course change the jobcard to your site's
specifications and change all occurances of "IBMUSER" to your userid.
Change "_HLQ_" has needed.  Instructions for dataset selection are
found as comments in XMITJOB1.  Check the "SYS1.ISPF" dataset name to
insure they match your installations ISPF datasets.  If you have copied
the rexx execs to another dataset change the SYSEXEC dsname.

In XMITALL change all "JESNODE" to your JES node name.  Also change
the code that builds the job cards and again here change all
occurances of "IBMUSER" to your userid. Change the "SYS1.ISPF" dataset
names as needed.  If you have copied the rexx execs to another dataset
change the SYSEXEC dsname.

Now it's your choice either execute XMITJOB1 for a complete one step
batch run or execute SELCTDSN REXX in ISPF and then execute XMITJOB2.

After running either one the the XMITJOBs, three datasets are created
that will needed to be submitted to create the datasets for FTPing.
They are userid.XMITE.JCL, userid.XMITN.JCL and userid.XMITS.JCL.  If
you used XMITJOB1, you may want to review the jobs and remove any
steps and commands for datasets that you do not wish to copy to your
pc.  A fourth dataset, userid.XMITC.JCL, is an IDCAMS delete of all the
temporary files and the XMIT output files.

The OPEN statement will need to be changed to your host name or ip
address in FTPSCRPT.  Change all occurances of "IBMUSER" to your tso
userid and "password" to your password in FTPSCRPT and RENALL.

For the simplist method to FTP the XMIT files to your pc.  Copy
FTPSCRPT and RENALL to the directory/folder on you pc where you want
the FTPed datasets. Rename RENALL to RENALL.bat.

After the first three jobs have completed successfully, open a DOS
window and and change directory (CD) to the directory you copied
FTPSCRPT and RENALL.  You can then issue the following command:

ftp -s:FTPSCRPT

This will start FTP and run the script file to download the files.
After the downloads are completed, issue the command:

RENALL

This will remove the quotes from the file names and change the LLQ on
the sequential datasets to "txt" to ease the viewing/editing on the pc.
