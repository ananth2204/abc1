  A CHANGE HISTORY FILE WITH INFORMATION FROM THE ENDEVOR CHANGE
  MANAGEMENT SYSTEM COULD BE CREATED EASILY.

   1.  CREATE AN ELEMENT REPORT FOR ALL ENDEVOR LIBRARIES WITH
       ALL STATISTIC INFORMATION ABOUT THE ELEMENTS.
   2.  CREATE AN EXTRACT FROM THIS REPORT IN THE FORMAT OF THE
       CHANGE HISTORY FILE (COPYBOOK JXCPR300).
   3.  UPDATE THE CHANGE HISTORY FILE WITH THIS EXTRACT USING PROGRAM
       JXC310JX.  CREATE AN ENDEVOR TYPE IN THE PROGRAM AND ADD
       SPECIAL CODE AS NECESSARY.
   4.  PROGRAMS JXC315JX, JXC320JX AND JXC370JX MAY NOT NEED ANY
       CHANGES.
