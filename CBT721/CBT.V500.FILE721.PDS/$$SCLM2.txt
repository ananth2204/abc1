SCLM Change History

Job JXD300 - Update SCLM Change History File

Description
Job JXD300 updates the SCLM Change History File with data extracted
from the SCLM Account File every day and creates Reports of the SCLM
elements changed.  Daily, month-to-date and previous month Reports of
changes are created.  A Report of all elements in DEV1 and UAT1 is also
created.  The SCLM Change History File includes changes made in PanApt
so the file contains change history for several years.

Program, Copybook, and Map changes are tracked.  Change Code,
Programmer Name and Date associated with element changes are stored in
the Change History File.

Job JXD300 executes Procs JXPR300 and JXPR505.  Proc JXPR300 updates
the SCLM Change History File from the SCLM Production Account File and
creates Reports.  Proc JXPR505 creates the DEV1/UAT1 SCLM Development
Report from the SCLM Development Account File.

First, the production SCLM Account file is copied to a sequential
dataset.  This dataset is sorted to remove unwanted record types.

Program JXC300SC creates a Daily Extract file using the record layout
for the Change History file.  This Daily extract only contains members
changed in a date range determined by card member JXSD300C.  It also
creates an element list of all elements in SCLM.

Program JXC310JX uses the Daily Extract files to update the SCLM Change
History file.  Only elements that have SCLM statistics that are
different than the previous run are updated.

Program JXC315JX identifies and flags elements that have been deleted.
If an element is in the Change History file but it is no longer in the
SCLM Account file, there will not be a record in the current element
list file.  A new record will be created for the Deleted elements with
a higher level number and "DELETE" in the status field.

Reports are then created for all changes made in the last day, the
current month and the previous month.

First, the development SCLM Account file is copied to a sequential
dataset.  This dataset is sorted to remove unwanted record types.

Program JXC300SC creates a Daily Extract file using the record layout
for the Change History file.  This Daily extract contains all members
in Development determined by card member JXSD300D.  It also creates an
element list of all elements in SCLM, but this isn't used.

Program JXE505 creates a report of all SCLM elements in Development.
Card members have information listing all Programmer Ids for each
manager and the Application groups for each manager.



Job Dependencies

Job JXD300 runs at 11:00 pm Monday to Friday.  Since there are usually
no SCLM changes made on weekends, this Job does not need to run on
Saturday or Sunday night.

This Job is not dependent on any other Jobs and no Jobs are dependent
on this Job.

The Last Maint File is used as input to RefWiz jobs JXD100, JXW375.

Programs

JXC300SC  Create a Daily Extract from the SCLM Account File.  There
are two output files.  One is the Daily Extract File that will be used
to update the SCLM Change History File.  The Runtype input card tells
the Program how many days of changes to extract.  The other is a list
of all SCLM elements currently in the Account File.

JXC310JX  Update the SCLM Change History File from the Daily Extract.
Since the Daily Extracts will contain elements from 5 days in the past,
duplicates of changes are bypassed.

JXC315JX  Identify Deleted elements.  This Program uses the list of
SCLM elements and matches the list to the elements in the SCLM Change
History File.  All elements in the SCLM Change History File that are
not in the list of current elements are flagged as being Deleted.

JXC320JX  Create the Last Maint File from the SCLM Change History
File.  The latest record for each SCLM element is written out unless
the latest record is for a Deleted element.  This file will be used in
Job JXW375  to update the RefWiz Program Master File with the date of
last maintenance.  It is also used in Job JXD100 to create CSD Extract
records for Stored Procedures.

JXC370JX  Create Change History Reports from the SCLM Change History
file.  Input cards tell the Program to create the Report formatted for
SCLM data and the time period to Report.  This Program can create
Reports for changes made Daily, Month-to-date, Previous Month or for
any Date range.

JXE505  Create a Report of all SCLM elements in DEV1 and UAT1 by
Manager.

What to do if Job JXD300 Abends in Production

This Job runs Monday to Friday so that the Change Reports show current
information for SCLM changes made during the week.  Job JXD300 can be
run at any time, but if it runs during the day there is a possibility
that it might interfere with programmers using SCLM.

If the Job abends because of insufficient space or for another reason
that can be corrected, follow the restart instructions.  Because new
generations are created for files, you may have to change some
symbolics from +1 to +0 or from +0 to -1 if restarting the Job.
Restart instructions are in the Proc and in the Restart Library.

If the Job abends and you find out from Tech Support
that a new release of SCLM was installed, follow the instructions for
checking a new release of SCLM.  Also follow the instructions for
putting JXD300 on hold until Program/JCL changes are ready for
Production.

You might be able to find out where the problem is by rerunning the
step that abended in Debug mode, unless the Job abended in a Sort step.
If one of the JXC3* Programs abended, change the symbolic for the Parm
for that Program to turn debugging on.  Change the symbolic DBG3** from
'N 00000 00000' to 'Y 05000 00000'. This will print about 5000 lines in
the Debug Report which is in DD RDBUG.  Most of the Debugging Reports
show the input data and output data being processed and can help you
figure out what the Program is doing.

If the Job abends on Monday - Thursday night and can't be fixed, then
the Operators can mark the Job Complete and the Job can be fixed the
next day.

 If Job JXD300 abends on Friday night and can't be fixed, then make
sure that file JX.ALL.XTRCT.CHGCTRL.LASTCHG.R5 exists.  This file is
needed for Job JXD100 that runs at midnight.  This File is also needed
for Jobs JXW375 that runs on Saturday morning.  If it doesn't exist,
then run only steps STEP0180 and STEP0190 to create it from the last
good generation of JX.ALL.XTRCT.CHGCTRL.SCLM(?).

If Job JXD300 doesn't run for a couple days, then the Change History
Reports will not have the latest information and the RefWiz Reports may
not have a correct Last Maint Date for some Programs.  Currently, the
Card member JXSD300C is set to pull 7 days of data each time it runs.
This is so that a comfortable overlap of data will be pulled.  If
JXD300 isn't run for more than 7 days, then change card member JXSD300C
to a larger number the first time it runs.




Putting Job JXD300 on Hold

You can put Job JXD300 on hold without affecting any other Jobs.

 If it is on hold for more than 6 days, change Card member JXSD300C to
have a value greater than 00007 so that all changes will be extracted.

Make sure that file JX.ALL.XTRCT.CHGCTRL.LASTCHG.R5 exists.  This file
is needed for Job JXD100 that runs at midnight.  This File is also
needed for Jobs JXW375 that runs on Saturday morning.  If it doesn't
exist, then run only steps STEP0180 and STEP0190 to create it from the
last good generation of JX.ALL.XTRCT.CHGCTRL.SCLM(?).

Reasons for putting Job JXD300 on hold.

If it doesn't look like you will be able to make the necessary changes
to fix the Job in one day.

If a new version of SCLM was installed and Job JXD300 is creating
incorrect data in the Reports and Change History Extract File.

If you cannot test a new version of SCLM before it is installed, put
the Job on Hold and run it manually until you are sure that the Job is
running correctly.

Procedure for putting JXD300 on hold.

Put Job JXD300 on hold until you can move the changes to Production.
Snap the last 2 production runs of JXD300 that ran successfully to
datasets.  Since this Job runs every day, there should be a couple Jobs
from previous days in IOF.  You will need the step statistics to make
sure that you are processing about the same number of Programs every
day.

When the Program/JCL changes are made, you can run JXD300 during the
day to make sure it works without having to worry about getting a
midnight call from Operations.
The symbolics are set up in the Proc so that you can use Production
input files and create Test output files and Reports.  Check each step
to make sure that Programs are getting extracted (JXC300SC) and are
updating the SCLM Change History Extract File (JXC310JX).



Cleaning up Files and Reports after an Abend

If the latest generation of JX.ALL.XTRCT.CHGCTRL.SCLM(0) has bad data
in it from the last run, then delete the zero generation so that the
previous generation is used the next time Job JXD300 runs.

If that file has bad data in it, then the Last Maint File should be re-
created from the last good generation.

If bad data has been getting put in the file for a while, determine the
last good date that it ran.  Check position 134 which has Capture (Run)
Date in CCYY-MM-DD format.  You can use a Sort to delete all records
greater than the last good date it ran.  Then change Card Member
JXSD300C to have the number of days from the current date to the last
good date and add a couple days for good measure.  The next time that
JXD300 runs, it will extract that number of days worth of changes from
the SCLM Account file and update the Change History File.  After the
File is caught up, change Card Member JXSD300C to have a value of
00007.


Changes for a New Release of SCLM

These are the only things in a new release of SCLM that will affect
this Job.

The names of the Account Files for Production and Development are
changed.
Change Symbolic SCLMFL in Proc JXPR300 for Production SCLM Account File
Change Symbolic SCLMFL in Proc JXPR505 for Development SCLM Account
File

The record layout is changed for the Account files.

If the Record Layout is changed, turn debugging on for Program
JXC300SC.  This will show the input and output.  The File has a fixed
part and a variable part.



Changes to Job JXD300 to run in Test

Change the Job card and Jobparm.
Remove the execution of Proc EQQDELDS.
To run the Job with Production input files and create Test output
files, change the following symbolics. These overrides will create test
file outputs.
