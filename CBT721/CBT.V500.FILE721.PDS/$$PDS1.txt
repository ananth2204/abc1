  WITH A RECORD FOR EACH TIME A MEMBER IS CHANGED, ADDED OR DELETED.



  THESE ARE THE MEMBERS USED FOR THIS APPLICATION.

  HOW TO SET UP THE PDS CHANGE HISTORY APPLICATION


  1. YOU NEED TO CREATE THE FOLLOWING GDG BASES
        JX.ALL.XTRCT.CHGCTRL.PDS(+0)    2 GENS

  2.  IDENTIFY ALL OF THE PDS LIBRARIES THAT YOU WANT TO TRACK.
      GET THE VOLSER THAT THE PDS LIBRARY IS ON.

  3.  GIVE EACH PDS LIBRARY A UNIQUE 8 CHAR ABBREVIATION AND SEQ NBR.

  4.  UPDATE CARD MEMBER JXSD370P WITH THIS INFORMATION.  YOU WILL
      USE THIS MEMBER TO KEEP ALL OF YOUR OTHER CHANGES ORGANIZED.

      EXAMPLE CARD JXSD370P: SET OF PDS LIBRARIES.

      ABBREV      PDS LIBRARY NAME       LIB SEQ  CARD MEMBER

      BINDLIB     SYS4.PROD.BINDLIB          15   JXSDIH15
      CARDLIB     SYS4.PROD.CARDLIB          03   JXSDIH03
      DBACTL      SYS.CONTROL.CARDLIB        07   JXSDIH07
      DBACTLF     SYS.FOR.CONTROL.CARDLIB    08   JXSDIH08
      DBRMSCLM    SCLM.PROD.DBRMLIB          13   JXSDIH13
      DCLGENPR    SYS4.PROD.DCLGEN           11   JXSDIH11
      JCLLIB      SYS4.PROD.JCL              01   JXSDIH01
      JCLREFWZ    JX.ALL.REFWIZ.SAMPLIB      17   JXSDIH17
      MACLIB      SYS1.MACLIB                18   JXSDIH18
      PROCFIX     SYS4.PROD.FIXPROC          04   JXSDIH04
      PROCLIB     SYS4.PROD.PROCLIB          02   JXSDIH02

  5.  UPDATE CARD MEMBERS JXSDIH** WITH DSN AND VOLSER.
      THIS IS AN INPUT CARD TO IEHLIST.  USE DUMP OPTION.

  6.  UPDATE CARD MEMBERS JXSDLB** WITH LIBRARY ABBREVIATION.
      ----+----1----+----2----+----3
      JCLLIB   JCL      NOTFIRST

      POS 1-8 IS THE ABBREVIATION
      POS 10-17 IS THE LANGUAGE OR TYPE OF LIBRARY.
      POS 19-27 HAS THE VALUE "NOTFIRST" FOR ALL OF THESE CARDS.

  7.  DETERMINE HOW LONG TO KEEP DELETED MEMBERS IN THE LAST-MAINT
      FILE.  THIS FILE HAS ONE RECORD PER MEMBER AND HAS ONLY THE
      LATEST ISPF STATS FOR EACH MEMBER.  IT DEPENDS ON HOW THIS FILE
      WILL BE USED. CHANGE SYMBOLIC JX320RUN IN PROC JXPR305.

      JXSD320A  CARD FOR DELETE DATE RANGE. KEEP ALL DELETES.
      JXSD320B  CARD FOR DELETE DATE RANGE. KEEP NO DELETES.
      JXSD320C  CARD FOR DELETE DATE RANGE. 12 MONTHS

  8.  THE JCL AND PROCS ARE SET UP TO PUT THE DATASETS AND REPORTS
      ON A SPECIFIC PACK THAT IS NOT MIGRATED. THAT MAKES IT EASIER
      TO USE AS A REFERENCE.

  9.  YOU NEED TO USE SPECIAL OPTIONS WHEN YOU RUN A PDS LIBRARY FOR
      THE FIRST TIME TO ADD IT TO THE PDS CHANGE HISTORY FILE.
      YOU CREATE THE FIRST PDS CHANGE HISTORY FILE BY RUNNING JOB
      JXR310F ONCE FOR EACH PDS LIBRARY.

      THE OVERRIDES FOR STEP0020 CONTAIN THE SAME DATA AS THE
      JXSDIH** CARDS AND THE VOLSER FOR DDNAME1

//*  POS 1-8   IS LIBRARY ABBREVIATION USED IN REPORTS.
//*  POS 10-17 IS LIBRARY TYPE.  USED FOR GROUPING LIBRARIES.
//*  POS 19-26 MUST BE VALUE "FIRST"
//*  POS 28-46 DATES REMAIN THE SAME. THIS IS FOR PDS MEMBERS W/NOSTATS
//STEP0060.LIBNAME DD *
PROCDBA  PROC     FIRST    2003-01-01 2003-001
//*

 10.  THE VERY FIRST RUN, THERE WILL NOT BE A +0 GEN OF THE PDS CHANGE
      HISTORY FILE, SO CHANGE SORTIN IN STEP0002 TO COPY ONLY THE
      WORK FILE TO THE +1 GENERATION. AFTER THAT, THE NEXT RUNS FOR
      OTHER PDS LIBRARIES WILL BE ADDED TO IT.

 11.  SET UP PROC JXPR305.  CREATE ONE EXECUTION OF PROC JXPR305A
      FOR EACH PDS LIBRARY.  IT IS A GOOD IDEA TO DOCUMENT WHAT STEP
      IS DOING WHICH LIBRARY.  IT WILL HELP YOU KEEP IT STRAIGHT.

 12.  SET UP PROC JXPR305.  CREATE ONE EXECUTION OF PROC JXPR305D
      FOR EACH PDS LIBRARY AT THE END OF PROC JXPR305 TO DELETE WORK
      FILES.

 13.  JOB JXD305 SHOULD BE SET UP TO RUN AFTER ALL PDS CHANGES HAVE
      BEEN MADE, BUT BEFORE MIDNIGHT.  THE RUN DATE WILL BE USED TO
      IDENTIFY THE DATE THE ELEMENT WAS MOVED TO PRODUCTION.

 14.  BEFORE YOU COMPILE THE PROGRAMS (JXC300PD, JXC310JX, JXC315JX,
        JXC320JX, JXC370JX, JXCU011) CHANGE THE FOLLOWING COPYBOOKS.
      JXINP005 THIS SHOULD BE OK AS IS.
      JXINP010 THIS SHOULD BE OK AS IS.
      JXINP300 IF THERE ARE SPECIAL CONSIDERATIONS WHEN FLAGGING
               MEMBERS AS DELETED, PUT THE CODE HERE.
      JXINW005 INSTALLATION CONSTANTS
               CHANGE INST-LINES-PER-PAGE ONLY IF NECESSARY
               CHANGE INST-COMPANY-NAME TO YOUR COMPANY NAME
               CHANGE INST-CEE-SW TO 'Y' IF ABEND USES CEE3DUMP.
               NONE OF THE OTHER OPTIONS ARE USED IN THIS PRODUCT.
      JXISPROD CHANGE STEPLIB IF USED. IF NOT USED, REMOVE INCLUDES
               FROM THE PROCS.

 15.  YOU CAN TEST THE BASIC PROCESS BY RUNNING JCL MEMBER INDXPDS.
      THIS IS A STANDALONE JOB TO CREATE A MEMBER LIST WITH ISPF STATS.
