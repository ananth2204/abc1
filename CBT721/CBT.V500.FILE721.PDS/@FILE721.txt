//***FILE 721 is from Shirley Huhtanen and contains an extremely    *   FILE 721
//*           interesting and potentially useful system to capture  *   FILE 721
//*           change history for members of libraries.  Details of  *   FILE 721

//*  This library is a self-contained unit and should contain all   *   FILE 721
//*  of the elements needed to create any or all of 3 different     *   FILE 721
//*  Change History capture systems.                                *   FILE 721
//*                                                                 *   FILE 721
//*  Why this system was created.                                   *   FILE 721
//*                                                                 *   FILE 721
//*  Some source management applications only have information      *   FILE 721
//*  about the last change made to a member.  Some can show         *   FILE 721
//*  historical information about all changes to a member, but      *   FILE 721
//*  only for one member at a time.  For members in PDS libraries   *   FILE 721
//*  that are not managed by a source management system, only       *   FILE 721
//*  information about the current version of a member is           *   FILE 721
//*  available.  Also, these systems may not identify the date a    *   FILE 721
//*  member was moved to production.  A member may be edited on     *   FILE 721
//*  one day and moved to production weeks or months later.         *   FILE 721
//*                                                                 *   FILE 721
//*  Here are 3 different systems for Change History depending on   *   FILE 721
//*  the type of source being tracked. A system for Endevor could   *   FILE 721
//*  be created easily using the same kind of methodology.  All of  *   FILE 721
//*  these systems create and maintain a history file that has one  *   FILE 721
//*  record for each time a member is changed, added or deleted.    *   FILE 721
//*                                                                 *   FILE 721
//*  The following information is captured:  element name,          *   FILE 721
//*  library, edit date/time, promote date/time, User id, change    *   FILE 721
//*  code/move request, level, number of lines.                     *   FILE 721
//*                                                                 *   FILE 721
//*  Here are some ways this information can be used.               *   FILE 721
//*                                                                 *   FILE 721
//*     1.  Create a summary report of changes made to all          *   FILE 721
//*           production members within a particular time period.   *   FILE 721
//*     2.  A daily report can be created that shows all members    *   FILE 721
//*           moved to production on that day.                      *   FILE 721
//*     3.  Identify all members changed during any time period.    *   FILE 721
//*     4.  For Sorbanes-Oxley reporting, this system provides an   *   FILE 721
//*           audit trail of changes to all production members      *   FILE 721
//*     5.  Identify members changed frequently.  Systems           *   FILE 721
//*           using these should probably be rewritten or           *   FILE 721
//*           redesigned.                                           *   FILE 721
//*     6.  Create summary reports of the number of                 *   FILE 721
//*           changes made by each programmer during a time         *   FILE 721
//*           period.                                               *   FILE 721
