  CHANGE HISTORY FILE FOR PANVALET SYSTEMS

  THIS APPLICATION CREATES A CHANGE HISTORY FILE WITH ONE RECORD ADDED
  TO THE FILE EVERY TIME AN ELEMENT IN PANVALET IS CHANGED, ADDED OR
  DELETED.


  THIS IS AN OLDER SYSTEM AND HAS NOT BEEN UPDATED TO USE THE
  NEW CHANGE HISTORY LAYOUT JXCPR300.  THIS WILL NEED TO BE DONE
  TO UPDATE THE REFWIZ PROGRAM MASTER FILE WITH LAST MAINT DATE.
  IF THE PAN#2 DIRECTORY REPORT HAS CHANGED FORMAT IN THE LAST
  COUPLE YEARS (SINCE 2003), THE PROGRAMS MAY NEED TO BE TWEAKED.

  DEPENDING ON HOW OFTEN YOU WANT TO UPDATE THE CHANGE HISTORY FILE,
  THIS COULD BE RUN DAILY OR WEEKLY.  IF IT IS RUN WEEKLY AND AN
  ELEMENT IS CHANGED MORE THAN ONE TIME DURING THE WEEK, ONLY THE LAST
  CHANGE WILL BE CAPTURED.

  A PAN#2 1-UP DIRECTORY LISTING IS RUN FIRST.  THIS REPORT IS
  USED AS INPUT TO PROGRAM JXE300PV WHICH CREATES A SEQUENTIAL FILE
  FOR THE PANVALET ELEMENTS.  PROGRAM JXE305PV UPDATES THE CHANGE
  HISTORY FILE IF THE ELEMENT STATISTICS HAVE CHANGED SINCE THE LAST
  TIME THE JOB WAS RUN.

  THE 2 PROGRAMS ARE WRITTEN IN EASYTRIEVE.

     JCL         JXRF301   - ONLY RUN THIS THE FIRST TIME
