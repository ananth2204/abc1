  WITH A RECORD FOR EACH TIME A MEMBER IS CHANGED, ADDED OR DELETED.



  THESE ARE THE MEMBERS USED FOR THIS APPLICATION.

  HOW TO SET UP THE SCLM CHANGE HISTORY APPLICATION


  1. YOU NEED TO CREATE THE FOLLOWING GDG BASES
        JX.ALL.XTRCT.CHGCTRL.SCLM(+0)    2 GENS

  2.  IDENTIFY ALL OF THE SCLM LIBRARIES THAT YOU WANT TO TRACK.

      USE IDCAMS TO COPY THE SCLM PRODUCTION ACCOUNT FILE TO A
      SEQUENTIAL DATASET.  SORT SUM THE FILE ON POSITION 15,8 TO
      FIND ALL OF THE TYPES.  MOST OF THE TYPES YOU WILL WANT TO
      OMIT.  PROGRAM SOURCE, COPYBOOK SOURCE, MAPS ARE THE TYPES
      YOU WANT TO KEEP.  IF JCL, PROCS ETC ARE KEPT IN SCLM, KEEP
      THOSE ALSO.

  3.  UPDATE CARD MEMBER JXSD370S WITH THIS INFORMATION.  YOU WILL
      USE THIS MEMBER TO KEEP ALL OF YOUR OTHER CHANGES ORGANIZED.

      EXAMPLE CARD JXSD370S: SET OF SCLM LIBRARIES.

      ABBREV      SCLM LIBRARY NAME

      CPYLIB      SCLM.PROD.CPYLIB
      EZTSRC      SCLM.PROD.EZTSRC
      HTML        SCLM.PROD.HTML
      MAPLIB      SCLM.PROD.MAPLIB
      SRCLIB      SCLM.PROD.SRCLIB

  4.  UPDATE CARD MEMBER JXSR300B TO OMIT UNNEEDED SCLM TYPES.
      INSTEAD OF INCLUDING THE TYPES YOU WANT, IT IS BETTER TO OMIT
      THE ONES YOU KNOW AREN'T NEEDED.  THAT WAY IF A NEW TYPE IS
      ADDED TO SCLM, IT WILL BE INCLUDED AUTOMATICALLY.

********************************************************
*  MEMBER JXSR300B
*  SORT SCLM ACCOUNT FILE BY ELEMENT NAME, LIBRARY
********************************************************
   SORT FIELDS=(23,8,CH,A,15,8,CH,A)
   OMIT COND=(5,1,CH,NE,C'A',OR,
      (15,8,CH,EQ,C'CPYLIB  ',AND,69,8,CH,EQ,C'MAP    '),OR,
       15,8,CH,EQ,C'ARCHDEF ',OR,
       15,8,CH,EQ,C'BIND    ',OR,
       15,8,CH,EQ,C'CCDEF   ',OR,
       15,8,CH,EQ,C'DBRMLIB ',OR,
       15,8,CH,EQ,C'DBUGLIST',OR,
       15,8,CH,EQ,C'DB2OUT  ',OR,
       15,3,CH,EQ,C'IDI',OR,
       15,8,CH,EQ,C'LECDEF  ',OR,
       15,8,CH,EQ,C'LOADLIB ',OR,

       15,8,CH,EQ,C'PACKAGE ',OR,
       15,8,CH,EQ,C'SYSDEBUG',OR,
       15,8,CH,EQ,C'HTMLBACK',OR,
       15,8,CH,EQ,C'SRCLIST ')

  5.  DETERMINE HOW LONG TO KEEP DELETED MEMBERS IN THE LAST-MAINT
      FILE.  THIS FILE HAS ONE RECORD PER MEMBER AND HAS ONLY THE
      LATEST SCLM STATS FOR EACH MEMBER.  IT DEPENDS ON HOW THIS FILE
      WILL BE USED. CHANGE SYMBOLIC JX320RUN IN PROC JXPR300.

      JXSD320A  CARD FOR DELETE DATE RANGE. KEEP ALL DELETES.
      JXSD320B  CARD FOR DELETE DATE RANGE. KEEP NO DELETES.
      JXSD320C  CARD FOR DELETE DATE RANGE. 12 MONTHS

  6.  THE JCL AND PROCS ARE SET UP TO PUT THE DATASETS AND REPORTS
      ON A SPECIFIC PACK THAT IS NOT MIGRATED. THAT MAKES IT EASIER
      TO USE AS A REFERENCE.

  7.  THE VERY FIRST RUN, USE THE FOLLOWING OVERRIDES IN JOB JXD300.

      SYMBOLIC JX300RUN='JXSD300D'
      //STEP0120.SORTIN DD DSN=NULLFILE,BLKSIZE=200

      THE OUTPUT OF STEP0080 IS ACTUALLY THE FIRST FILE AND THE REST
      OF THE PROC DOESN'T NEED TO RUN, BUT RUNNING IT ALL WILL GIVE
      YOUR FIRST REPORTS ALSO.

  8.  JOB JXD300 SHOULD BE SCHEDULED TO RUN AFTER ALL
      SCLM CHANGES HAVE BEEN MADE FOR THE DAY.

  9.  BEFORE YOU COMPILE THE PROGRAMS (JXC300SC, JXC310JX, JXC315JX,
        JXC320JX, JXC370JX, JXE505, JXCU011) CHANGE THE FOLLOWING CPYBKS.
      JXINP005 THIS SHOULD BE OK AS IS.
      JXINP010 THIS SHOULD BE OK AS IS.
      JXINP300 IF THERE ARE SPECIAL CONSIDERATIONS WHEN FLAGGING
               MEMBERS AS DELETED, PUT THE CODE HERE.
      JXINW005 INSTALLATION CONSTANTS
               CHANGE INST-LINES-PER-PAGE ONLY IF NECESSARY
               CHANGE INST-COMPANY-NAME TO YOUR COMPANY NAME
               CHANGE INST-CEE-SW TO 'Y' IF ABEND USES CEE3DUMP.
               NONE OF THE OTHER OPTIONS ARE USED IN THIS PRODUCT.
      JXISPROD CHANGE STEPLIB IF USED. IF NOT USED, REMOVE INCLUDES
               FROM THE PROCS.

 10.  THE DEVELOPMENT SCLM REPORTS ARE ORGANIZED BY MANAGER AND
      PROGRAMMER ID. UPDATE CARD MEMBER JXSD505A TO LIST ALL
      PROGRAMMER IDS AND THE NAME OF THEIR MANAGER.  UPDATE CARD
      MEMBER JXSD505B TO LIST THE PROGRAM PREFIXES FOR EACH MANAGER.
      IF THESE CARD MEMBERS ARE EMPTY, THE REPORT WILL SORT ALL OF
      THE SCLM ELEMENTS IN DEVELOPMENT BY PROGRAMMER ID.
