PDS Change History

Job JXD305 - Update PDS Change History
Description

Job JXD305 updates the PDS Change History File with ISPF Statistics
extracted from the Production PDS libraries every day and creates
Reports of the PDS elements changed.  Daily, month to date and previous
month Reports of changes are created.  The PDS Change History was
started in December 2003, so it only contains changes made in
Production since then.

JCL, Proc, Cardlib, Dclgen changes are tracked.  Programmer Name and
Date associated with element changes are stored in the PDS Change
History File.

Job JXD305 executes Proc JXPR305.  Proc JXPR305 executes Proc JXPR305A
once for each Production PDS library.  Then it combines all of the
extracts before updating the PDS Change History File and creating
Reports.  Proc JXPR305D deletes all the work files created in Proc
JXPR305A.  It is run once for each time JXPR305A is executed.

First, Proc JXPR305A is executed once for each PDS library being
tracked.  In this Proc, IEHLIST is executed to dump the ISPF statistics
for the PDS.  Program JXCU011 converts this data to readable format
since it is in hex and binary.  Program JXC300PD reads this formatted
report and creates a Daily Extract file using the record layout for the
Change History file.  It also creates an element list file with one
record for each element in the PDS library.

After all of the PDS libraries have been processed, all of the Daily
extract files are sorted together and all of the element list files are
sorted together.

Program JXC310JX uses the Daily Extract files to update the PDS Change
History file.  Only elements that have ISPF statistics that are
different than the previous run are updated.

Program JXC315JX identifies and flags elements that have been deleted.
If an element is in the Change History file but it is no longer in the
PDS, there will not be a record in the current element list file.  A
new record will be created for the Deleted elements with a higher level
number and "DELETE" in the status field.

Reports are then created for all changes made in the last day, the
current month and the previous month.

Job Dependencies

Job JXD305 runs at 11:00 pm every day.   It must run before midnight,
or all the PDS changes for the day will be attributed to the next day.
If it doesn't run for a day, then all changes for that day will be
attributed to the first day the Job runs again.

This Job is not dependent on any other Jobs and no Jobs are dependent
on this Job.

The Last Maint File is used as input to JXW375 to update the Program
Master and Copybook Master files.


Programs

IEHLIST This is an IBM utility that dumps ISPF Statistics for a PDS
Library in hex format.  The input card must have the PDS Library name
and Volser.  The Volser must also be in the JCL.

JXCU011 Create a PDS Member list with ISPF Statistics.  The hex
data output from IEHLIST is converted into readable display data.

JXC300PD  Create a Daily Extract from ISPF Statistics for Production
PDS libraries.  There are two output files.  One is the Daily Extract
File that will be used to update the PDS Change History File.  The
other is a list of all PDS elements currently in the PDS Library. The
Libname input card tells the Program the abbreviation to use for the
PDS Library in the Daily Extract file.  This is executed once for each
PDS library..

JXC310JX  Update the PDS Change History File from the Daily Extracts.
Since the Daily Extracts will contain all elements, elements which do
not have changed ISPF Stats since the last Change History file update
are bypassed.

JXC315JX  Identify Deleted elements.  This Program uses the list of
PDS elements created by JXC300PD and matches the list to the elements
in the PDS Change History File.  All elements in the PDS Change History
File that are not in the list of current elements are flagged as being
Deleted.

JXC320JX  Create the Last Maint File from the PDS Change History
File.  The latest record for each element is written out.  A control
card determines whether or not to keep Deleted elements.  This file
will be used in Job JXW375  to update the RefWiz Program Master File
with the date of last maintenance.  It is also used in Job JXD100 to
create CSD Extract records for Stored Procedures.

JXC370JX  Create Change History Reports from the PDS Change History
file.  Input cards tell the Program to create the Report formatted for
PDS data and the time period to Report.  This Program can create
Reports for changes made Daily, Month-to-date, Previous Month or for
any Date range.

What to do if Job JXD305 Abends in Production

If Job JXD305 abends in an IEHLIST step, it is probably because a PDS
library was renamed or deleted.  Check the PDS Library and make
corrections to the JCL symbolic for the step and to the Cardlib Member
for the step.

If the library was renamed, then change the name in the Cardlib Member
JXSDIH* listed above and also in member JXSD370P.

If the library was moved to a different disk pack, change the JCL
symbolic PDSVOL in the correct step in Proc JXPR305 and also in the
Cardlib Member JXSDIH* listed above.

If the library was deleted, remove the steps for this library from Proc
JXPR305 and remove the file from STEP1010 and STEP1090.

This Job runs every day so that the Change Reports show current
information for Production PDS changes made during the week.  Job
JXD305 can be run at any time, but if it runs during the day there is a
possibility that it might interfere with Production Jobs.  While
IEHLIST is reading a PDS Library, no other Job can update that PDS
Library.

If the Job abends because of insufficient space or for another reason
that can be corrected, follow the restart instructions.  Because new
generations are created for files, you may have to change some
symbolics from +1 to +0 or from +0 to -1 if restarting the Job.
Restart instructions are in the Proc and in the Restart Library.

If Job JXD305 abended because a new version of Program IEHLIST was
installed, then you will need to find out what JCL changes are needed
and make changes to Program JXCU011 as needed.  Also follow the
instructions for putting JXD305 on hold until Program/JCL changes are
ready for Production.

You might be able to find out where the problem is by rerunning the
step that abended in Debug mode, unless the Job abended in a Sort step.
If one of the JXC3* Programs abended, change the symbolic for the Parm
for that Program to turn debugging on.  Change the symbolic DBG3** from
'N 00000 00000' to 'Y 05000 00000'. This will print about 5000 lines in
the Debug Report which is in DD RDBUG.  Most of the Debugging Reports
show the input data and output data being processed and can help you
figure out what the Program is doing.

If the Job abends and can't be fixed, then the Operators can mark the
Job Complete and the Job can be fixed the next business day.   All
Production changes made will be attributed to the next day the Job runs
instead of the day the changes were actually made.


Putting Job JXD305 on Hold

You can put Job JXD305 on hold without affecting any other Jobs.

Reasons for putting Job JXD305 on hold.

If it doesn't look like you will be able to make the necessary changes
to fix the Job in one day.
If a new version of IEHLIST was installed and Job JXD305 is creating
incorrect data in the Reports and Change History Extract File.
If you cannot test a new version of IEHLIST before it is installed, put
the Job on Hold and run it manually until you are sure that the Job is
running correctly.

Procedure for putting JXD305 on hold.

Put Job JXD305 on hold until you can move the changes to Production.
Snap the last 2 production runs of JXD305 that ran successfully to
datasets.  Since this Job runs every day, there should be a couple Jobs
from previous days in IOF.  You will need the step statistics to make
sure that you are processing about the same number of elements every
day.
When the Program/JCL changes are made, you can run JXD305 during the
day to make sure it works without having to worry about getting a
midnight call from Operations.
The symbolics are set up in the Proc so that you can use Production
input files and create Test output files and Reports.  Check each step
to make sure that Programs are getting extracted (JXC300PD) and are
updating the PDS Change History Extract File (JXC310JX).



Cleaning up Files and Reports after an Abend

If the latest generation of JX.ALL.XTRCT.CHGCTRL.PDS(0) has bad data in
it from the last run, then delete the zero generation so that the
previous generation is used the next time Job JXD305 runs.

If bad data has been getting put in the file for a while, determine the
last good date that it ran.  Check position 134 which has Capture (Run)
Date in CCYY-MM-DD format.  You can use a Sort to delete all records
greater than the last good date it ran.  The next time that JXD305
runs, it will attribute all changes since the bad date to the current
day.


Maintenance to Job JXD305 for PDS Library Changes
A PDS library is renamed.

Change card member JXSD370P to have the correct PDS library name. This
member will tell you the sequence number for the PDS library processing
step in the Proc.
Change all references to the PDS library in Proc JXPR305.  These are
all documentation references.
Change the card member JXSDIH** to have the correct library name. Get
the ** value from card member JXSD370P.
Change doclib member SYS2.PROD.RESTART(JXD305)


A PDS library is moved to a different disc pack.

Change the symbolic VOL** for the PDS library in Proc JXPR305 in the
correct Step.
Change the card member JXSDIH** to have the correct Volser. Get the **
value from JXSD370P.


You want a PDS library to have a different abbreviation.

Change the abbreviation in card member JXSD370P.
Change the card member JXSDLB** to have the correct Abbreviation. Get
the ** value from card member JXSD370P.
Change the library abbreviation in the master file.
JX.ALL.XTRCT.CHGCTRL.PDS(0).  If you can edit the file in 3.4, make a
global change on the old name to the new name in position 16.  Ex:  C
ALL NEWPROC  PROCFIX 16  Otherwise, use Easytrieve or Sort to change
the name.


Add a new PDS library.

When a new PDS library is added, you need to run Job JXR310F to create
an initial extract for the library and sort this file into the PDS
Change Master file before making proc changes and running Job JXD305.
This will ensure that these members are not all flagged as "NEW" which
will give them the current date as the Promote Date.  Making the first
extract separately with a special card will give these PDS members a
Promote Date/Time with the value of the last Edit Date/Time.  This is
more accurate.

1.  Get the Dataset name for the PDS library.
2.  Get the VOLSER for the PDS library.  You can get this in 3.4.

3.  Add the new library to card member JXSD370P.  Assign it a new
sequence number and abbreviation.

4.  Set up new cards for the library.
JXSDIH** is used for IEHLIST.  Put the PDS library name and the Volser
name in it.
JXSDLB** is used to assign the library abbreviation.  Put the
abbreviation in Pos 1-8, put the type in position 10-17.  Position 19 -
26 should be NOTFIRST for the production card.




5.  Make the first Extract for the PDS library.
Set up Job JXR310F.
Change SUFW and SUFO to use the sequence number for the PDS.
Change the JCL overrides for DDNAME1, SYSIN and LIBNAME to point to the
DSN and Volser.
Run Job JXR310F.  This will create the first extract and merge it into
the PDS Change History file.

6.  Update Proc JXPR305.
Add the new PDS library to the comments in the Proc
Add a new symbolic for the Volser for the PDS.  It will have the format
VOL** using the sequence number.
Add a new step for IEHLIST after the last one in the proc.  The step
number will have the sequence number of the PDS - STEP0**0. Add the
IEFBR14 for the output file &PREFW..IEHLIST.DUMP**.&SUFW before it.
Add a new step for JXCU011 after the last one in the proc.  The step
number will have the sequence number of the PDS - STEP1**0. Add the
IEFBR14 for the output file &PREFW..JXCU011.RPT**.&SUFW before it.
Add a new step for JXC300PD after the last one in the proc.  The step
number will have the sequence number of the PDS - STEP2**0. Add the
IEFBR14 for the 2 output files &PREFW..XTRCT.PDS**.&SUFW and
&PREFW..LIST.PDS**.&SUFW before it.
Add the new XTRCT file to STEP3010 Sort.
Add the new LIST file to STEP3090 Sort.
Add these files to the delete steps at the end of the Job.
&PREFW..IEHLIST.DUMP**.&SUFW
&PREFW..JXCU011.RPT**.&SUFW
&PREFW..XTRCT.PDS**.&SUFW
&PREFW..LIST.PDS**.&SUFW

7.    Move the Proc and Cardlib members to Production on the same day
that you create the first extract and merge it into the PDS Change
History file.  If JXD305 runs before you merge the first extract into
the PDS Change History file, every member will be flagged as NEW with
current date as Promote Date.  If JXD305 runs after the first extract
has been merged into the PDS Change History file, but before the Proc
has been changed to extract the new PDS daily, then every member in the
new PDS library will be flagged as Deleted.


Remove a PDS library.

If you remove the processing for a PDS library from the Proc JXPR305,
every member in that library will be flagged as deleted the first time
JXD305 runs after the Proc is changed.  If you don't want a record of
these members at all, you can delete the records from the PDS Change
History file using the abbreviation for the PDS library in a sort to
omit them.

Remove the library from card member JXSD370P.  Make a note of the
sequence number and abbreviation.

Remove the steps in Proc JXD305 for this PDS library.
STEP0**0  Program IEHLIST.  Also delete IEFBR14 before this step.
STEP1**0  Program JXCU011. Also delete IEFBR14 before this step.
STEP2**0  Program JXC300PD. Also delete IEFBR14 before this step.
Add the new XTRCT file to STEP3010 Sort.
Add the new LIST file to STEP3090 Sort.
STEP9***  Remove work files for this PDS from the final Delete steps.
&PREFW..IEHLIST.DUMP**.&SUFW
&PREFW..JXCU011.RPT**.&SUFW
&PREFW..XTRCT.PDS**.&SUFW
&PREFW..LIST.PDS**.&SUFW

Two Card members used for this PDS library can be deleted.  JXSDIH**
and JXSDLB** where ** is the sequence number for the PDS library.

Optional.  Delete the PDS members from the PDS Change History file
using a SORT to create a new generation.  SORT FIELDS=COPY   OMIT
COND=(16,8,CH,EQ,C'XXXXXXXX')  where XXXXXXXX is the abbreviation for
the PDS library.  If you don't do this, every member in the library
will be flagged as Deleted in the history.  You might want history for
these members or you might not want history for these members.


Two PDS libraries are merged together.

In this situation, one of the PDS libraries is being deleted.  The
members in the PDS Change History file for the deleted library need to
have their library abbreviation changed to the library abbreviation for
the new merged library.

1.  If all PDS members in both libraries are unique:
Follow the instructions for deleting a PDS library, but do not delete
any records from the PDS Change History file.
Follow the instructions for changing the library abbreviation for a PDS
library.  In the PDS Change History file, change the library
abbreviation for the merged members from the old abbreviation to the
new abbreviation.  If you can edit the PDS Change History file, then
make a global change on the library abbreviation name in position 16.
Ex:  C ALL NEWPROC PROCFIX 16.  Otherwise, use Easytrieve to change the
name.

2.  If some member names exist in both libraries, determine which
member will be kept.
If the members are moved from the old library to the new merged library
without replacing the new member, then you will want to delete the
history for these members in the old library before changing the
library abbreviation on the other records.
If the members are moved from the old library to the new merged library
and replace the new member, then you will want to delete the history
for these members in the new merged library before changing the library
abbreviation in the records for the old library.
