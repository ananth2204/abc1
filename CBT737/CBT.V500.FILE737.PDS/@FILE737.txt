//*     A seldom used RACF feature is the "ERASE on SCRATCH".       *   FILE 737

//*     DRCLEAR is a REXX that creates two sets of jobs that        *   FILE 737
//*     affect every UCB in the D/R exercise. These jobs are        *   FILE 737
//*     submitted by the technician after he has cleared off        *   FILE 737
//*     the VTOCS. The first set of jobs create dummy datasets      *   FILE 737
