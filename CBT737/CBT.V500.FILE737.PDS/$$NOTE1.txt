Sam - Attached is a file containing 12 source members.  It
may take a few tries but it works fine for us.

It is based upon our experiences using SUNGARD.  Users at IBM
recovery centers will have to make a few minor changes.

The end goal of this package is to clear all D/R volumes to low
values AFTER the excercise is complete.

Finally, 3390 MOD-54 support is not in the package.  We will
update the package for their support as soon as we order them.
It curently supports 3390 MOD-3,9,L(27).

Regards,  Bob
