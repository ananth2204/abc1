                           BACKGROUND

This package supports the following DASD types at SUNGARD:

  3390 Mod-3
  3390 Mod-9
  3390 Mod-L

A seldom used RACF feature is the "ERASE on SCRATCH". When RACF is set
up correctly, it will write lo-vals on every track of its target data
set when its scratched. DRCLEAR is a REXX that creates two sets of jobs
that affect every UCB in the D/R excercise. These jobs are submitted by
the technician after he has cleared off the VTOCS. The first set of jobs
create dummy datasets on all the UCBs and the second set does the
scratching.
In a typical D/R this procedure cleared to lo-vals in App 1 hour the
following:  121 MOD-3, 121 MOD-9, 126 MOD-L

                           STEPS TO INSTALL

1. Copy all members to a SOURCE PDS dataset.
2. NOTE: Its easier to keep all members (except the LMOD) in the SAME
   ----  dataset. We keep it in our DISASTER INSTLIB.
3. Assemble pgm DRSPACE using member ASMSPACE. Output loadlib must be
   catalogued AND accessible to the D/R floor system, usually in LNKLST.
4. Copy REXXs DRCLEAR & DRICK to a your D/R instlib.
5. Copy member ICKIN to your D/R instlib, you must edit the JOB card.
6. Copy members MODLALLC & MODLSCRT to your D/R instlib.
   Do not change anything in them unless you intend to alter DRCLEAR.
7. Copy the POOL members to the D/R library.
8. CHANGE REXXs DRCLEAR & DRICK : find
                CDRSDS ='DISASTER.MVS.'Sysname'.INSTLIB'
   and change it to your disaster instlib name. Both REXXs assume that
   your SYSID is part of its name, If you don't wish to adhere to this
   you can change the REXXs.
9. CHANGE REXX DRCLEAR  : find routine "READMODL" and change 2 JOB cards
   to your standards.


                 STEPS FOR PROCESSING AT YOUR SITE (TESTING)

1. Populate the POOL members with the D/R UCBs. POOL3 for 3390-3, etc.
2. To test at your site  prior to the excerise you must prep the RACF
   environment:
    ("ERASE-ON-SCRATCH") :
    For this process to work, SETROPTS ERASE(NOSECLEVEL) must be set.
    In addition, the rule IBMUSER.DR*.*  (see DSNAME in the MODELS)
    must be created for the above setting with the "ERASE ON DELETE"
    option turned on - where dsname HLQ is IBMUSER. IBMUSER is the ONLY
    HLQ at SUNGARD that is previously set to accomplish our task.
3. To execute :
   > "TSO ALTLIB ACT APPL(EXEC) DAT('--YOUR D/R INSTLIB--')
   > "TSO DRICK"- This generates VTOC clearing ICKDSF JCL for all the
      UCBs found in the POOL members and saves them in member ICKOUT.
   > View member ICKOUT, created by DRICK. This wipes out
     all VTOC info. It MUST run prior to DRCLEAR since DRCLEAR
     assumes an empty VTOC.

      TEST PHASE

   > Make sure LMOD DRSPACE is accessible
   > Pick a few sacrificial UCB's to test with, THEY WILL BE CLEARED !
   > Populate the POOL members with test UCBs
   > Run the ICKDSF clears : REXX DRICK produces member ICKOUT. Submit
     ICKOUT.
   > "TSO ALTLIB ACT APPL(EXEC) DAT('--YOUR D/R INSTLIB--')"
   > "TSO DRCLEAR"
   > enter your SYSID when prompted
   > enter 'TEST' instead of 'PROD' until you get a clean run
   > enter total no. initiators you will provide
   > REXX runs & produces rpt -NO ALLOC/SCRATCH members created IN 'TEST'

      PROD PHASE

   > Same as above but answer w/ 'PROD'
   > Once 'PROD' is used the REXX creates the 2 JCL members per device
     type. It supports 3 types (3390-3, 3390-9, 3390-L). The members
     are named ALLOCx & SCRATx where x=3 or 9 or L. There are multiple
     JOBS in each member.
   > REXX runs & produces rpt
   > Submit all ALLOCx members to define dummy datasets on all POOL UCBs
   > Submit all SCRATx members to delete/erase the dummy datasets
   > The more inits used, the faster the process goes

                           STEPS FOR PROCESSING AT D/R

1. Populate POOL members with SUNGARD UCB ranges
2. The RACF environment is already set correctly for HLQ IBMUSER
3. Repeat the same steps as in the 'TEST & PROD' phases above
