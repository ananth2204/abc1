+

+ will be generating JCL for i.e. %CAI CA1 R12+.
+
+ Enter in the dataset prefix for the install datasets i.e.
+ %SDSMPOEM.CAI.CA1.R12+
+
+ Last, enter in the prefix for any datasets that will catalogued in the
+ master catalog i.e. %SYS3.CA1.R12SP0+ and any datasets that will be SMS
+ managed i.e. %SDPROD.CA1.R12SP0+
+
+ Once these fields have been filled in, enter %C+ to create a new profile.
+
+ You can then edit the profile, by entering a %E+ next to your newly created
+ profile. From this panel, you can either delete datasets that you
+ do not want to FTP such as DLIBs or select datasets for those you
+ want to FTP to a destination system.

+ clear this profile in the table.
