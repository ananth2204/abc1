To run FTP under Hercules, please use these statements as a model.
This is for the PROFILE member, in the TCPPARMS dataset.

Copy these statements into the PROFILE member of TCPPARMS, and
comment out all similar statements (DEVICE, LINK, HOME, GATEWAY,
DEFAULTNET, and START) that are in the existing PROFILE dataset.

Of course you will have to adjust the IP4 address numbers.  These
will have to correspond with the numbers and the mac address that
are in the Hercules config file.
