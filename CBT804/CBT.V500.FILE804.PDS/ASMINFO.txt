         MACRO
&LBL     ASMINFO
.**********************************************************************
.*
.*  THIS MACRO PRODUCES A CONSTANT STRING IDENTIFYING THE TIME,
.*  DATE, DATASET, MEMBER, AND JOBNAME OF THE ASSEMBLY OF THE
.*  INVOKING PROGRAM.
.*
.* *IMPORTANT*
.*
.*  In order to produce the correct results, the macro source member
.*  must be in the same PDS as the source member, and this PDS should
.*  be 1st in the syslib concatenation.  This is because the DSN and
.*  MEMBER symbols are local in scope and reflect the MACRO source
.*  rather than the assembler program.
