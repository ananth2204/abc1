Sam,

I have updated File 789. It includes:

Replacing the GDGCOPY program from FILE482 with a
GDGCOPY REXX I wrote using BPXWDYN & the Catalog Search
Interface (CSI).

Various fixes to DATEX (including some new functionality)

A few fixes to the SCRTML & SENDMAIL REXXes (fixed some
shop specific coding).

Thanks for keeping CBTTape.org up to date.
