¬  The LF Command
¬
¬    Format: LF (no abbreviation for this command)
¬
¬    There is only room in the Member List panel to show three or four
¬    statistics fields at once. The LF command moves the display of
¬    member statistics one field to the left each time the command is
¬    entered.
¬
¬    The order of fields is: vv.mm, Created, Changed, Time, Size, Init,
¬                            Mod, User, amd Alias.
¬
¬    If the Created, Changed, and Time fields are showing, the LF
¬    command would shift the display to the left so that the vv.mm,
¬    Created, and Changed fields were showing.
