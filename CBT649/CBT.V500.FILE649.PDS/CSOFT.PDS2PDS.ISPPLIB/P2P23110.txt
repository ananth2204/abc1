¬  Global Command 'SC' - Invoke SuperCe for both datasets
¬
¬      This command will compare matching members in both datasets.  Members
¬      that appear only in one dataset or the other are not selected for
¬      comparison.
¬
¬      This command will take you to the SuperCe panel (ISPF Option 3.15). If
¬      you did not enter the VOLSER for the dataset on the dataset name panel,
¬      the dataset names will be filled in for you on the SuperCe panel.
¬
¬      If you did fill in the VOLSER field for one of the datasets then that
¬      dataset name will be blank on the SuperCe panel. Just press ENTER on the
¬      SuperCe panel to proceed to the next panel, which is where you will enter
¬      the uncataloged DSN and VOLSER.
¬
¬      Once the SuperCe screen appears you can set or change any of the SuperCe
¬      commands or options just as if you had entered SuperCe through the
¬      regular ISPF menu.
