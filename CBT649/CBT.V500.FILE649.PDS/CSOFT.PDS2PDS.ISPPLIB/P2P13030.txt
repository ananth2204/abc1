¬
¬     This option will display a pds member only if the name appears
¬     in both partitioned datasets, AND the statistics for each member
¬     are different.
¬
¬     Members that appear only in one pds or the other will not be
¬     displayed and members that appear in both datasets but whose
¬     statistics are the same will not be displayed.
