¬
¬  The Confirm Line Command fields provide a way to prevent the
¬  accidental deleting, renaming, or moving of members during the
¬  execution of line commands.
¬
¬  The Confirm Line Command options are in effect for the Copy, Delete,
¬  Move, and Rename commands. They are not in effect for the Edit,
¬  Browse, View, Show All Stats, or SuperCe commands since these commands
¬  do not automatically change either dataset.
¬
¬  Valid values for these fields are Y, N, or blank. If the fields
¬  contain N or blank no command confirmation is done.
¬
¬  If either field contains 'Y' a panel is displayed asking you to
¬  confirm the command.
