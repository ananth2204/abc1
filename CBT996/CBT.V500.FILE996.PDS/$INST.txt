     Mr. SAM,

     I would like to thank you very much for being the gate-keeper
     of the CBT.  The CBT is a wonderful idea and I hope that the
     content is found as useful as I have found it.  Maybe it will
     inspire others to write reusable code that is shareable with
     others.

     I have sent you user documents (MS Word format) for a load
     library scanner, Rexx Toolkit, and a String handling package.

     The load library scanner is one assembler program (SSLEANAL)
     and can be found in the bundled member ASUASM, common assembly
     JCL (ASMBCL) can be found in the bundled member ASUCNTL.  First
     compile COBOL program ASUP2DSB with JCL (COBBCL).  This program
     is used in the assembly JCL to create the NAME Binder statement.

     The Rexx Toolkit can be found in the bundled member EXEC.

     The String handling package along with a number of other utilities
     can be found in the bundled members ASUASM and ASUCOB.  The
     member ASUASM contains the assembler programs, macros, and
     copybooks.  There are numerous macros like label trace, numeric
     test, dope vector, table index calculator, register 14 stack,
     a couple versions of binary search, fibonaccian search, linear
     search, heap sort, some data conversion routines from Dr. John
     Ehrmam's book, and his bit handling "Micro-Compiler".  The
     member ASUCOB contains the COBOL programs and copybooks.

     Member IEBUPDT1 can be used to un-bundle all of the bundled
     members (ASUASM, ASUCNTL, ASUCOB, EXEC, MODEL, REXXBJCL, and
     REXXBLIB) into separate source libraries.  You can use the
     utility IEBUPDTE or PDSLOAD.

     Once you have created the separate source libraries you can view
     the $DIRSTR member(s) to determine assembly/compile JCL and IVP
     JCL.  Member @STRSVC names the programs associated with the
     String package.  Member @ASUMSG list all of the LE messages
     that can be issued by the String package, and the values of
     the variables.

     First compile COBOL program ASUP2DSB with JCL (COBBCL).  This
     program is used in the assembly JCL to create the NAME Binder
     statement.

     You have a few choices when installing the String package.  As
     separate load modules and/or one single load module.  Use JCL
     (ASMSTR) to create separate load modules for each service.  Use
     JCL (ASMPKG) to create a single load module for all services.

     The $DIRSTR member(s) provide the program names, assembly/
     compile JCL to use and the IVP JCL to test the programs.  The
     IVP programs should provide the necessary reference material
     on how to call and/or run everything provided.

     The bundled member MODEL contains the IDCAMS control card models
     for the batch Rexx exec (BLDIDC).

     The bundled member REXXBJCL contains the JCL used to execute
     all of the batch Rexx libary members.

     The bundled member REXXBLIB contains the batch Rexx execs.
