Hello everybody.

I'm attaching a zip with my program called BSPUFI (Batch SPUFI).
The program combines all or almost all features of IBM sample
program DSNTEP2/4 (aka SPUFI), DSNTIAUL (Unload), replaces QMF
proc and queries using SESSION tables (DECLARE GLOBAL TEMPORARY
TABLE) vs SAVE DATA tables, run DB2 commands and process its
output, write out selected reports to a flat file in different
formats and read those files to db2 tables, and some other
features. This program is very useful for me, and probably it
would be useful for other zOS programmers.

When you have some free time please take a look at the attachment
and let me know your opinion, thanks.
