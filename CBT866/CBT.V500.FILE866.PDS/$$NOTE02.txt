Notes on installation.

1.  This package came as a zip of 4 files.  I repackaged them into
    this pds, and you can reconstruct them as follows:

    A.  The C file - This file's members were copied into File 866.

    B.  The DBRMLIB file - You must RECEIVE this from member DBRMLIB:

        TSO RECEIVE INDS(this.pds(DBRMLIB))

    C.  The LOADLIB file - You must RECEIVE this from member LOADLIB:

        TSO RECEIVE INDS(this.pds(LOADLIB))

    D.  The output of the DEMOJOB.  You must receive this from member
         DEMOSDSF:

        TSO RECEIVE INDS(this.pds(DEMOSDSF))

    I hope that the rest is self-explanatory.  Good luck.  Please
    write to the author, not to me.
