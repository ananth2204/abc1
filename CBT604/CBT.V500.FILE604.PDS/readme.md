//***FILE 604 is the Bell Labs SNOBOL4 load module which has        *   FILE 604
//*           been reassembled and relinkedited with the OS/390     *   FILE 604
//*           DFSMS binder, from a complete disassembly, using      *   FILE 604
//*           the Startool disassembler, under the MVS/370          *   FILE 604
//*           (pre-XA) instruction set.  The disassembled source    *   FILE 604
//*           has also been included as member SNOBOL4S, but it     *   FILE 604
//*           is in zipped format, and has to be unzipped (you      *   FILE 604
//*           can FTP it in BINARY to a PC) in order to see and     *   FILE 604
//*           use it.  The load module is in TSO XMIT format,       *   FILE 604
//*           and it is called member SNOBOL4X.                     *   FILE 604
//*                                                                 *   FILE 604
//*           The original load module was found on the files       *   FILE 604
//*           section of the Hercules-390@yahoogroups.com news      *   FILE 604
//*           group.                                                *   FILE 604
//*                                                                 *   FILE 604
//*           I am trying to make the old load module more          *   FILE 604
//*           accessible to users with a recent MVS system, but     *   FILE 604
//*           since I didn't have the original source, I have       *   FILE 604
//*           included a disassembly, which you can assemble and    *   FILE 604
//*           linkedit on your own system.                          *   FILE 604

//*           An object deck (as member SNOBOL4O) has also been     *   FILE 604
//*           included.  This has been prepared with the Startool   *   FILE 604
//*           delinker.                                             *   FILE 604
