IBM System 360/370 Compiler and Historical Documentation
                  from Peter Sylvester


Fathers of Simula:

Ole-Johan Dahl
Kristen Nygaard


   This site is dedicated to the fathers of Simula.  WHEN looking
   INTO the Internet, documentation FOR old SIMULA compilers AND
   even the original language definitions are difficult TO find.
   Well, UNTIL I discovered the Hercules, which IS NOT a SIMULATION,
   AND the free IBM MVS system.  I became motivated TO REACTIVATE my
   collection of SIMULA things, documents AND the original IBM
   360/370 compiler.  IF you don't like THIS SIMSET, please DETACH,
   we will not RESUME you.  OTHERWISE, feel free TO INSPECT.

The Beta Language Book Home page introduces: "In the beginning
there was Simula - designed by Kristen Nygaard and Ole-Johan Dahl
at the Norwegian Computing Center in the 1960s, the first
language to introduce the techniques now known as Object-Oriented
Programming (OOP)".  Dave Parnas wrote about the Turing prize:
"Finally, they have given this prize to people who have really
made a difference.  In more ways than I can ever explain, your
work has changed the way people think about software and write
about software."


The SIMULA System 360/370 Compiler and Runtime system

Simula XMI.  Here you can have the Simula compiler and its runtime
system.  To my knowledge, this Simula implentation was done with
PL/360.  The compiler had a year 2000 problem.  After patching
one octet in the load module the beast became tame.  There are
some funny protection techniques in the code which made it
difficult to use TSO TEST.

The file contains compiler and runtime system in XMIT/RECEIVE
format.  You can use the hercules dasdload program to install it
at whatever location you want.
