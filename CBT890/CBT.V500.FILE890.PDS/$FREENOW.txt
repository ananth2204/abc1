 Simsalabim. Free or not? Yes, it is.

  The following is correspondence between Peter Sylvester
  and Gunnar Syrrist of the company which owned Simula in
  previous years.

  --------------------------------------------------------------

  Hello to you, as well.  Your e-mail was finally passed on to
  me.  I worked at the Norwegian Computing Center (NR), way back.
  I worked in Simula a.s. afterwards, as long as we managed to
  keep the company going.  I was responsible for the IBM SIMULA
  system, among others, in both cases.  I am actually very
  pleased that you have managed to get the old IBM SIMULA system
  up and running on an MVS emulator.  Impressive!  Yes, of course
  you may continue to use it!  I was the last person in Simula
  a.s.  I maintained a website and an e-mail address a number of
  years after the company terminated its operation, to keep the
  PC SIMULA system available for those who wanted to use it.  It
  is still available for those who know where to find it
  (http://prosjekt.ring.hibu.no/simula/).  I am not working with
  SIMULA at present, but keep those interested up to date as to
  what is still available.

Best regards,
Gunnar Syrrist
Simula

My question is whether I can give it out into the public.
With all relevant references, credits, etc, whatever necessary.

There is a so called TURNKEY MVS system and people try
to collect "free" compilers for this beast.

Yes, by all means, make it available.

Best regards
Gunnar
