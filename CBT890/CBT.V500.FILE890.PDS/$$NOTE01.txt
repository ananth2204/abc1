Hi,

I have seen that there are compilers etc on the cbttape.

Would you mind adding copies of what I have collected at
http://www.edelweb.de/Simula

I wonder about the best way to have pdf files.

Thanks in advance.

Peter

Hi Peter,

   It looks like a candidate for the CBT Tape.  I can easily
   handle PDF files.

   Please tell me where all of the components and documentation
   are.  I will need to collect them.  This will make my work
   much easier.

   It will be my pleasure to put Simula on the tape.  Please
   point me to all the relevant places.  Thanks much.

All files are linked locally in http://www.edelweb.de/Simula.

wget -r http://www.edelweb.de/Simula

That should do it, you just take the files in the Simula
subdirectory

BTW:  There exist paper listings of the compiler and runtime in
Norway.  We didn't find the source code, though.  This compiler is
a masterpiece (partially done hired IBM programmers by NCC).  I am
still thinking to reconstruct.  Most of the compiler is written in
PL360.

Thanks and best regards,
Peter
