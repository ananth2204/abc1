Simula Users Guide  Unfortunately the quality of the scanned text
is rather bad, some of the original pages having almost no
contrast.  I am working on that.  I haven't integrated revised
pages.  The image is a scanned part of a real original binder.

Simula Programmer's Guide IBM System 360/370   (SPG-- members)

Simula Programmer's Guide   The writers of the texts seems to like
drinking, there is a built-in feature.  Don't use the report
procedure.  Rather write to me.

There is also the External Procedure Library documentation that
makes available various external functions via the EXTERNAL
ASSEMBLY interface.  They form an integral part of the run-time
system and allow to access to various features of the run-time
system and of the operating system in general, e.g., you can
execute any arbitary pieces of code without the need to program
you own assembly functions.
