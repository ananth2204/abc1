//***FILE 890 is from Peter Sylvester and contains the SIMULA       *   FILE 890
//*           360/370 Compiler and Library, and much PDF-format     *   FILE 890
//*           documentation to support it.  SIMULA was              *   FILE 890
//*           originally a commercial product for IBM 360/370       *   FILE 890
