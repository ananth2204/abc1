             CHANGES TO THE BACKEMUP CLIST COLLECTION

1.  CLISTs GENUNLD and GENPOPS were reworked for a JES2 environment
    at z/OS 1.4 and 1.5.

2.  A sequential copy program called SEQCPY is available for use
    with this package, as a TSO XMIT-format loadlib in member SEQCPY
    of this pds.  The job in member SEQCPY@ will convert the SEQCPY
    member into a usable load library.

3.  The GENUNLDX CLIST was adapted from GENUNLD and should produce
    similar output JCL.  The difference is that if you have to back
    up several hundred datasets with GENUNLD, you may run out of
    TSO region.  With GENUNLDX, you won't.  The difference is that
    with GENUNLDX, the list of dataset names is read twice, whereas
    with the other CLISTs, it is stored and rewritten several times.

 SUPPLEMENTARY DOCUMENTATION - 05/12/87.

 ***  OUTLIST  ***

 A NEW CLIST CALLED "OUTLIST" HAS BEEN WRITTEN TO ARCHIVE TO TAPE
 MULTIPLE HELD SYSOUTS HAVING THE SAME JOBNAME.  I USE IT TO ARCHIVE
 MY SMP JOBS, WHICH ARE HELD, AND SITTING ON SYSOUT.

 INPUT IS A LIST OF LEFT-PADDED JOB NUMBERS.  FOR EXAMPLE.  IF THERE
 ARE 5 HELD JOBS WITH JOB NAME TST2#SG$, WITH JOB NUMBERS:  23, 141,
 1368, 8821, AND 8845.  INPUT TO THE CLIST IS:

 *THIS IS A COMMENT CARD. ASTERISK IS IN COLUMN 1.
 0023
 0141
 1368
 8821
 8845

 OUTPUT IS JCL BELOW.  LOOK AT THE CLIST AND THE OUTPUT TO SEE HOW
 TO ADJUST THE PARAMETERS.

           *****      BACKEMUP   ADDENDA      ********
05/10/88

PLEASE SEE SAMPLE CLIST INPUT IN THE SAMPINPT MEMBER OF THIS PDS.


PLEASE NOTE THAT THE "BACKEMUP" CLISTS ARE USEFUL FOR DOING IEBCOPY
AND SEQUENTIAL BACKUPS OF NONVSAM DATASETS ON OLD DISK PACKS WHEN
CONVERTING DEVICE TYPES, SAY FROM 3330V OR 3350 TO 3380.  IT IS EASY
TO GENERATE THE INPUT STREAM FOR THE "GENVOL" OR "GENVOLI" OR
"GENVOLIF" CLISTS FROM THE TSO-IN-BATCH JOB TSOBATV1, WHICH IS
INCLUDED IN THIS PDS.  TSOBATV1 TAKES A VTOC LIST OF ALL THE
DATASETS ON THE PACK AND PUTS THE DATASET LIST IN A FORM THAT IS
VERY CLOSE TO WHAT THESE CLISTS NEED FOR INPUT.


IF YOU ARE BACKING UP ALL THE PARTITIONED AND SEQUENTIAL DATASETS ON
ONE PACK, YOU CAN RUN THE GENVOLIF CLIST AGAINST THE ENTIRE LIST OF
DESIRED DATASETS ON THE PACK.  WHEN THE TAPE REEL OVERFLOWS, JUST
CANCEL THE JOB WITHOUT A PURGE, AND MAKE CAREFUL NOTE OF WHICH
DATASETS GOT BACKED UP PROPERLY.  LOP THOSE DATASET NAMES OFF THE
TOP OF THE ORIGINAL DATASET LIST, RERUN THE CLIST GENVOLIF TO
GENERATE NEW JCL FOR A NEW TAPE REEL, AND CONTINUE BACKING UP THE
REST OF THE DATASETS ON THE NEXT REEL.  WHEN ALL THE DATASETS ARE
BACKED UP, JUST RUN A TAPEMAP JOB AGAINST THE REELS THAT GOT FILLED
UP COMPLETELY.  THIS IS PAINLESS, RELATIVE TO CODING JCL TO BACK UP
HUNDREDS OF SEPARATE DATASETS.  MEMBER CALLED "TAPEMAP" IN THIS PDS
HAS SAMPLE JCL TO RUN THE TAPEMAP PROGRAM (FILE 299) FOR MULTIPLE
TAPE VOLUMES.

THE SEQUENTIAL COPY PROGRAM "SEQCPY" IS FOUND IN LOAD MODULE
FORM IN MEMBER SEQCPY, AND CAN BE RESTORED BY THE TSO COMMAND:
  TSO RECEIVE INDS(THIS.PDS(SEQCPY))
SEQCPY HAS NO RESTRICTIONS ON THE FORMAT OF THE SUFFIXES TO
//IN--- AND //OUT---.  THEY MUST ONLY BE PAIRED.

I HAVE REWRITTEN THE CLIST "GENPOPS" FOR THE FTL PROGRAM, CALLING
IT "GENPOPSF".  "GENPOPS" BACKS UP LISTS OF CATALOGED PO AND PS
DATASETS.  I HAVE ALSO REWRITTEN "GENVOL" AS "GENVOLF".  "GENVOL"
BACKS UP PO AND PS DATASETS ON A SINGLE PACK, CATALOGED OR NOT
CATALOGED.  "GENVOLI", WHICH IS LIKE "GENVOL", BUT WHICH INITTS THE
OUTPUT TAPE FIRST, HAS BEEN REWRITTEN AS "GENVOLIF".  THIS WILL GIVE
YOU AN IDEA AS TO HOW TO CONVERT ANY OTHER OF THE CLISTS IF YOU NEED
TO.  THIS PACKAGE OF CLISTS SHOULD NOW BE USEFUL TO A WIDER
AUDIENCE, SINCE ALL THE NECESSARY MATERIALS ARE CONTAINED IN ONE
SOURCE, NAMELY, ON THE CBT TAPE.

                         SUPPLEMENTARY CHANGES

12/12/88  -  ADDED SYSUT3 AND SYSUT4 WORKAREA DD CARDS IN CASE THE
              BACKED UP DATASET IS VERY LARGE.

           *****      BACKEMUP      *****

FUNCTION OF CLISTS:
   CONVERT A LIST OF DATASET NAMES TO DISK-TO-TAPE BACKUP JCL.

SHORT DESCRIPTION:
   ONCE YOU HAVE A SET OF CLISTS LIKE THESE, YOU'LL WONDER
   WHAT YOU EVER DID WITHOUT THEM .

   THIS FAMILY OF CLISTS SOLVES AN OLD, NAGGING PROBLEM OF
   IBM PROGRAMMERS, NAMELY, THAT OF BACKING UP A LARGE
   NUMBER OF PDS'ES AND SEQUENTIAL DATASETS TO TAPE.  THE
   USUAL WAYS OF DOING THIS REQUIRES SETTING UP A PROC, AND
   CODING A LARGE NUMBER OF EXECUTIONS OF THE PROC, FOR
   DIFFERENT DATASETS. YOU HAVE TO KEEP TRACK OF THE FILE
   NUMBERS ON TAPE, AND IT'S A BIG PAIN IN THE (YOU FILL IN
   THE BLANK), AT ITS EASIEST.

   WITH "BACKEMUP" CLISTS YOU JUST HAVE TO MAKE A LIST OF
   THE DATASETS ON A CARD-IMAGE FILE, RUN A CLIST AGAINST
   THE LIST, AND BANG-ZOOM, IN A FEW SECONDS, YOU HAVE YOUR
   IEBCOPY JCL--JUST LIKE THAT !!


SUMMARY OF CLISTS BY CATEGORY:

    BACK UP PDS'ES     - GENUNLDS
    BACK UP SEQUEN     - GENGENR
    BACK UP PDS'ES
      AND SEQUEN       - GENPOPS  (LIST PDS'ES FIRST, THEN A
                                      CARD WITH "?" IN COLUMN
                                      1, THEN LIST ALL
                                      SEQUENTIAL DATASETS)
    BACK UP PDS'ES
      AND SEQUEN ON
      A GIVEN VOLUME   - GENVOL   (INPUT DATASET HAS SAME
                                      RULES AS GENPOPS -
                                      DSORG PO DATASETS
                                      LISTED FIRST, THEN ?
                                      CARD, THEN DSORG PS.
                                      CLIST POINTS TO A
                                      SPECIFIC VOLSER, AND
                                      THE DATASETS DON'T HAVE
                                      TO BE CATALOGED.  )
    JOBCARD FOR JES3   - GNJES3J
    JOBCARD FOR JES2   - GENJOBCD
    JES3 EQUIVALENTS   - GNJES3*  (THESE HAVE JES3 JOBCARDS)

       ********   ********   ********   ********

FURTHER HELP AND DESCRIPTION:

   PLEASE SEE MEMBER TSOBATV FOR GREAT ASSISTANCE IN BACKING
   UP PO AND PS DATASETS ON A GIVEN VOLUME.  OUTPUT OF THIS
   JOB IS CLOSE TO THE FORMAT USED FOR INPUT TO THE CLIST
   CALLED "GENVOL".  ONLY MINOR MASSAGING WITH ISPF EDIT
   IS NECESSARY.  "VTOC" PGM FOUND ON CBT TAPE - FILE 300.

   JEFF BROIDO WROTE THE ORIGINAL CLIST, GENUNLD.  I HAVE
   MODIFIED HIS ORIGINAL VERSION FOR SEVERAL OF MY PURPOSES,
   AND HAVE WRITTEN ANOTHER ONE, GENPOPS, THAT ADDED THE
   CAPABILITY OF DUMPING SEQUENTIAL DATASETS AFTER DOING THE
   PDS'ES.  I USE THE SEQCPY PROGRAM FOR SEQUENTIAL DATASET
   DUMPING TO TAPE.  A LOAD LIBRARY CONTAINING THE SEQCPY LOAD
   MODULE IS FOUND IN THE SEQCPY MEMBER OF THIS PDS, AND CAN
   BE RESTORED WITH THE TSO COMMAND:

   TSO RECEIVE INDS(THIS.PDS(SEQCPY))

   MY CLISTS USE THE FILE 299 TAPEMAP PROGRAM (ORIGINAL WAS
   FROM UCLA).  THEY ALSO USE THE INIMITABLE PDS PROGRAM FROM
   FILE 182, AND I USED TO HAVE THE VENDOR PRODUCT PDSFAST,
   WHICH SUBSTITUTES FOR IEBCOPY WITH THE SAME JCL, EXCEPT FOR
   PROGRAM NAME.  THESE CLISTS MAY NEED TSO/E, BUT IF YOU'RE
   CLEVER, YOU CAN GET AROUND THAT (IT'S ONLY NEEDED DURING
   THE INPUT FILE READ, IN WHICH THE DATASET NAMES ARE
   CONVERTED INTO A HUGE STRING).
