Hi Sam.

This Rexx was requested by the production staff to survey the
disk space occupancy.  As input, it uses a dcollect and a list of
dataset's masks using classical z/OS filtering rules.  As output,
it gives the disk space occupancy in gigabytes for each mask.
It is interesting because of the dataset parsing algorithm.  It
seems to me that it was never done with Rexx before.
