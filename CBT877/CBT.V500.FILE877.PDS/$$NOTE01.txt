Hi Sam,

These macros allow us to get rid of annoying actions
(copy,paste,switch screen) when we are in a jcl member and want
to just quickly open a data set or a member whose name is already
on the screen in View or Edit session/mode.  Having Fn keys
assigned to run macros (for example F4=V, F16=E) now we can move
the cursor to the needed data set name or member and press F4 to
view or shift+F4 to edit.  (Or you can use any other PF keys.)

Probably CBT already has similar macros but I have not found
them. If you think new macros would be useful for people please
accept my XMI file.

Thanks.
