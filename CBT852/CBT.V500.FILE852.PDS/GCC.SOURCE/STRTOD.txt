@deftypefn Supplemental double strtod (const char *@var{string}, char **@var{endptr})

This ISO C function converts the initial portion of @var{string} to a
@code{double}.  If @var{endptr} is not @code{NULL}, a pointer to the
character after the last character used in the conversion is stored in
the location referenced by @var{endptr}.  If no conversion is
performed, zero is returned and the value of @var{string} is stored in
the location referenced by @var{endptr}.
