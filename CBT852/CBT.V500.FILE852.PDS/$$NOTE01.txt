Hi Sam.

I have released a new version of GCC.
You can find the XMIT here:

https://sourceforge.net/projects/gccmvs/files/GCCMVS
/GCC%203.2.3%20MVS%209.0/gccmvs-3_2_3-9_0-xmit.zip/download

Note that I am no longer using GCC 3.4.6
because it has too many bugs in it that I
can't fix.

This latest version is really good technically.
I can produce 31/ANY load modules that still
work on MVS 3.8J and MVS/380 in 31-bit.
It's also AM32 clean.

Thanks. Paul.
