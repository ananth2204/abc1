)F FUNCTION


 USYNC   (Add a userid record to SYS1.BRODCAST, or the active
          Broadcast Dataset, or Delete a userid record from
          the active Broadcast Dataset.)

 Purpose:  To ADD or DELete a Userid (to/from) SYS1.BRODCAST
           or whatever the *active* Broadcast Dataset is.
           This will enable the userid to receive user
           broadcast messages on TSO.

           (8-character userids, defined for z/OS 2.3 and
           higher releases, are not defined in SYS1.BRODCAST.
           8-character userids can only receive user messages
           from TSO Userlogs, if they are defined for that id.
           However, even if a z/OS 2.3 system is set to allow
           8-character userids, shorter userids (7 characters
           or less) can still be defined in the Broadcast
           Dataset, and will be used, if userlogs are not
           turned on for the id.)

)X SYNTAX
 USYNC  userid   ADD | DEL


)O OPERANDS

))ADD | DEL

   ADD specifies that this userid is to have a userid record
       added to SYS1.BRODCAST so that this id can receive TSO
       delayed broadcast messages.

   DEL specifies to delete this userid's user record from
       SYS1.BRODCAST.

   Note that RACF checking is performed first, to verify that
       this userid is defined to RACF, before any action is
       performed.
