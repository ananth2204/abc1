Hi Dave,

I recall your site.  I was looking for a command processor to
process an individual SYNC request to SYS1.BRODCAST using the
RACF IKJIFRIF utility.  I could not find one so I wrote my own.
We have a central non-mainframe developed system that processes
userid add/delete requests, but this system was invoking the SYNC
command every time a request to add or delete a userid was
requested.   This was inefficient as the complete RACF database
was SYNCed with SYS1.BRODCAST and any pending messages were
deleted as well.  I attached the code, usermod, and JCL for
whatever you want to do with it.
