Notes about USYNC usage.

1.   USYNC has to be linkedited with SETCODE AC(1), and it
     needs to be placed in an APF-authorized load library.

2.   Since USYNC needs to be authorized as a TSO command, it
     must also be placed in the IKJEFTE2 table, which is done
     (one way) by adding it to the AUTHCMD list in PARMLIB
     member IKJTSOxx, and doing a PARMLIB UPDATE(xx) or an
     IPL.

     Then, it will work.
