Sam,

I downloaded the SMFDUMP program from File 686 of CBT468.  It
worked ok except there was no message coming out saying the dump
was complete for the SMF dataset.  The manual says that for a
multi-line message you must clear the 3 high order bytes of
register zero.  After adding an instruction to clear register
zero before the multi-line WTO, the messages started coming out.
I added a SR R00,R00 after label DEQDONE.  It's just a one
instruction change.  Would you like me to send you my updated
copy of the program?

Warren
