Single member PDS, XMIT'd - source only.  Some comments inline,
most people should know what to do with it.  I merely removed the
MVS V4 code and added a check for GRS - enabled me to skip the
RESERVE if it was active.

Was going to do some more drastic surgery, but this should allow
current users to feel comfortable.

Has been tested in both GRS active and GRS(NONE) environments,
and appears to work as advertised.

Cheers  ...  Shane
