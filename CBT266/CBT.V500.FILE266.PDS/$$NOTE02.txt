Fix for "time and date" routine.

  This problem resulted from my first fix, it seems.

  I found that the execution time for the program was being
  reported wrong.  So instead of fixing the WKDATE routine, I
  replaced it with a routine that I knew was working correctly.
  This was the TODAY routine, which I lifted from the TAPEMAP
  program on CBT Tape File 299.

  Actually, the TODAY routine also reports the Julian date, which
  the WKDATE routine didn't report.  So there's an improvement.

  Problem fixed, Dec. 18, 2012.
