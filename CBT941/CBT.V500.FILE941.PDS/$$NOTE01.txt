Hello dear Mr. Golob.

I'd like to offer MVS-related tools written by me for a years.
Let me start from the few simple tools:

1. Simple AMBLIST interactive interface

2. Generate data set definition for an existing data set
   (Supersede CBT tape file 920).   Called DDL.

3. Load ISPF Table from CSV (comma-separated values) flat file
   and vice versa. Allow ISPF tables' maintenance under SCLM.
   Called CSV2ISP and ISP2CSV.


As you see, I've contributed both MF format (XMIT) as well as PC
format (zip). Just let me know if this packaging is inconvenient

Please consider my files.  Thank you.

Regards,
Gregory.
