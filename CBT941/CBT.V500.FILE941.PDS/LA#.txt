        sets as a set of ALLOCATE commands or JCL DD statements.


Syntax:
        LA ¢TSO ¦ JCL!

  	TSO (the default) caused LA to generate TSO ALLOCATE commands to
        reproduce current data set allocation. JCL caused LA to generate
        a set of JCL DD statements.

        LA may be used as a command on TSO READY prompt, on ISPF =6 or on
