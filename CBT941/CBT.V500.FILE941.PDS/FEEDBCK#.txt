Function: Complete error notification.

Usage:    This procedure designated for use in batch JCL jobs,
          usually as a last step (but not necessarilly). Traps
          the highest completion code of the previous (already
          completed) job steps as well as jobname, jobid and
          userid, then reads SYSUT1 stream and substitute any
          occurences of %MAXCC%, %JOBNAME%, %JOBID%, %USERID%,
          %DD%, %MM%, %YYYY%, %YY%, %JJJ% with an appropriate
          values and writes to SYSUT2.
          %MAXCC% will substituted with maximum job step completion code
          %JOBNAME% will substituted with actual job name
          %JOBID% will substituted with actual job id
          %USERID% will substituted with actual userid assigned to the job
          %DD% will substituted with actual day (two digits)
          %MM% will substituted with actual month (two digits)
          %YYYY% will substituted with actual year (four digits)
          %YY% will substituted with actual century year (two digits)
          %JJJ% will substituted with actual day of year (julian date, three dig

          SYSUT1 data usually assumed to be a complete SMTP stream:
          HELO SMTP_host
          MAIL FROM: sender
          RCPT TO: recipients
          etc. etc.
          QUIT

Syntax:   FEEDBACK Â¢ctlchar!
          ctlchar - replacement for substitution control charater.
                    default is '%'.

Example:  //   IF condition THEN
          //   EXEC PGM=IRXJCL,PARM='FEEDBACK'
          //SYSEXEC  DD procedure_library
          //SYSTSPRT DD SYSOUT=*
          //SYSUT1   DD *
          HELO there
          MAIL FROM:<somebody@somewhere>
          RCPT TO:<gbliznet@iba.by>

          To:<gbliznets@iba.by>
          Subject: Feedback: %USERID% %JOBNAME%(%JOBID%) completed, rc %MAXCC%

          <html><body><tt><pre>
          Feedback: %USERID% %JOBNAME%(%JOBID%) completed, rc %MAXCC%
          </pre></tt></body</html>

          .
          //SYSUT2   DD (B,SMTP)
          //   ENDIF

Note:     Starting z/OS 2.1 JES2 able to substitute the following
          JCL symbols to the input stream: &SYSUID, &SYSJOBNM, &SYSJOBID.
          However, max job step completion code cannot be substituted,
          at least with z/OS 2.3
