ISP2CSV - unload ISPF table to CSV file

Function:
    Unload ISPF Table to comma-separated flat file (CSV file)/ CSV
    file can be easily edited on z/OS with powerfull ISPF editor as
    well as transferred to the workstation and processed with MS
    Excel, Lotus 123 and many other programs.

    This procedures can be used to perform the following tasks:

        Perform data exchange between z/OS ISPF and any workstation
        spreadsheet processor (MS Excel, Lotus 123 and so on). CSV
        file processed by both procedures has the same structure as
        used by the workstations spreadsheet processors. Data can be
        processed using the powerfull features of the spreadsheet
        processor - creating diagrams, complex calculations and so
        on, and if necessary - transferred back to the z/OS and
        loading to the same or another ISPF table.

        Maintain ISPF table source together with CSV2ISP procedure.
        ISPF table data can be maintaned as a text file. ISP2CSV
        procedure can be defined as SCLM CSV language translator to
        maintenance table data under SCLM and maintained
        automatically as integral part of other source code.


Syntax:
     ISP2CSV   table_specification   CSV_specification  >fs  >fd!!

table_specification
    Refers to ISPF table. The one of the following should be specified:

      * library(member)
      * DDname=ddname(member)

    Only partitioned data set (PDS, PDSE) allowed. If reference to
    DD name specified, this DD must be preallocated. Both data set
    and member (i.e. the ISPF table) must exist. If reference to DD
    name specified in form DDname=ddname, appropriate DD name cannot
    define a member of the partitioned data set, reference in form
    DDname=ddname(member) should be used instead.

CSV_specification
    Refers to CSV file. The one of the following should be specified:

      * dataset
      & library(member)
      & DDname=ddname
      * DDname=ddname(member)

    Either member of the partitioned data set (PDS, PDSE) or
    sequential data set (PS) can be specified. If reference to DD
    name specified, this DD must be preallocated. Data set must be
    preallocated anyway. Member, if specified, will be replaced if
    it already exists or added otherwise. If reference to DD name
    specified in form DDname=ddname, appropriate DD name cannot
    define a member of the partitioned data set, reference in form
    DDname=ddname(member) should be used instead.

fs
    field separator. Either one character or two hexadecimal digits.
    Optional, comma by default.

fd
    field delimiter. Either one character or two hexadecimal digits.
    Optional, double quote by default.


Usage notes:

    1.  All parameters are positional
    2.  The first line of unloaded CSV file would contains field
        names, separated by field separator (comma). Key fields names
        are uppercase, other fields are in lowercase. Table data
        follows the header. All fields are separated by field
        separator, all non-numeric field enclosed in field delimiters
        (double quote);
    3.  Output data set or library must be preallocated;
    4.  Unloaded table should not contains field names started
        with two underscope character (__). There are no any other
        restrictions on the unloaded table. The table can be defined
        with or without keyed fields, with or without non-keyed
        fields. However, the output data set or library should have
        sufficient record length to fit all table fields and added
        field separators and field delimiters.
    5.  Parameters in form library(member) may be useful for
        interactive ISPF session, for a batch job form reference to
        DD name may be more convenient.
    6.  ISPF environment required to run this procedure in batch
        job (use ISPF or ISPSTART). See job example below:


   //ISPF     EXEC PGM=IKJEFT01,REGION=0K
   //SYSTSPRT DD  SYSOUT=*
   //SYSPROC  DD  DISP=SHR,DSN=CENTER.CLIST
   //SYSEXEC  DD  DISP=SHR,DSN=ISP.SISPEXEC
   //ISPPLIB  DD  DISP=SHR,DSN=ISP.SISPPENU
   ...  other ISPF libraries
   //SYSTSIN  DD  *
    ISPF CMD(%ISP2CSV DD=TBL(TEST) DD=CSV)
   //CSV      DD  DISP=SHR,DISP=&SYSUID.CSV.DATA
   //TBL      DD  DISP=SHR,DSN=&SYSUID.ISPF.TABLES

   JCL procedure ISP2CSV provided to simplify use of ISP2CSV in batch.


   //ISP2CSV  PROC LIB=,     -- Table Library, mandatory
   //          CSV=,     -- CSV Data Set, mandatory
   //          TABLE=    -- Table Name, mandatory
   //          FS='',    -- Field Separator, optional, ',' by default
   //          FD='',    -- Field Delimiter, optional, '"' by default
   //          SELF=CENTER.CLIST, -- Library where ISPTCSV resides
   //          ISPFHLQ=ISP -- ISPF data set prefix, usually ISP or SYS1

   Thus, with procedure above job to load table from CSV look as
   follows:


   //SYSPRG1A JOB  MSGCLASS=H
   //PROC     JCLLIB ORDER=(CENTER.PROCLIB)
   //         EXEC ISP2CSV,
   //            TABLE=TEST,
   //            LIB=&SYSUID.ISPF.TABLES,
   //            CSV=&SYSUID.CSV.DATA
   //
