Note.  This sysmod is not intended for use in a production system.
       It is more suited for a software house, where similar packs
       are used for different releases or copies of the software,
       and it is possible that copies of an authorized library may
       lie on several different packs.

       With this mod, you don't have to worry about authorizing the
       same library 5 different times (for the different packs) in
       the PROGxx PARMLIB member.

       However, in a production environment, it is possible to produce
       a rogue copy of an authorized library, and do some harm.
       Therefore, this mod has a use, but only in some trusted shops
       such as a system software development house.
