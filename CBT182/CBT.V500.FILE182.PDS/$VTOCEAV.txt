If you are using the EAV version of the VTOC command, then you
need to use Simonetti Pietro's version of @DIALSTC called @PSILSTC
on the distribution file.  Just issue a RENAME SWAP before running
the PDS assembly/linkedit job.

Displacements of the VTOC output have changed due to EAV updates
to the VTOC command.  See CBT file 112 for details.
