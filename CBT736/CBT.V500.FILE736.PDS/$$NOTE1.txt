Hi Sam,

Just wanted to let you know I wish to submit a Perl script, named
IODF.CGI for the CBTTAPE. It takes an IOCP and produces a table,
in HTML, of the channels, associated control units and devices.
It also gives switch information. As it is for USS and the
Webserver, I am unable to send as an XMIT file so it will be in
Zip format which will be about 18K.

If this is ok then I'll send it through by email.

Thanks,

Mark Naughton

Hi Sam,
Thanks for the reply.

I've copied it into a XMIT file now with LRECL of 400, and put a
documentation file in there as well. If there are any problems
with it, please drop me a mail.

Have a great week, and thanks again for your help, and likewise,
to you and your family,

Mark.
