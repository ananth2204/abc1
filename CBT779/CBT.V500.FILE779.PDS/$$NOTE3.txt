Hi Sam,

Attached is an updated XMIT file.  I added a compile JCL as you
requested as member $COMPILE, but please feel free to rename it
as appropriate.  I also had to update the SYMBSUB program source
code.  I had inadvertently left some COPY statements in it that
referred to local code that is not freely distributable.

Thanks,
Bill
