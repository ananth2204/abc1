Sam,

I would like to contribute a program source code to the CBT tape.
I posted to the IBM-MAIN discussion list about this program a
little while ago to the thread with subject "JCL procedure
parameters".

This is a COBOL II program that I wrote from scratch to perform
batch symbolic variable substitution on 80 byte cards.  What
makes this particular program unique from previous programs of
it's ilk, is that it invokes SDSF to read it's own jobs' JESJCL
file from the spool and it parses that jcl to find the
symbolic values.  This eliminates the need for passing the
symbols from the jcl to the program and also gets around the 100
character parm bottleneck.  It can read multiple input files and
write multiple output files in a single execution.  It
substitutes symbolic variables using basic jcl substitution
syntax rules.  This permits creation of control cards, etc. that
have symbolic variables that are resolved at execution time.  The
program is smart enough to detect which job step it is executing
within and to resolve the symbols to the appropriate values for
that step.

The submitted file was a zipped ASCII text file.  I have not run
into any problems with converting it back and forth between EBCDIC
& ASCII.  In this pds, the file has been converted into EBCDIC.
Please let me know if you need further information from me for this
contribution.
