Sam,

I found and corrected a critical bug in this program in March.  I
have held off until now submitting an update to insure that I had
not introduced other issues.  It has continued to work without
incident in our production environment since then, so I feel it
is safe to forward it on to the rest of the world.

I am attaching an updated XMI file that looks the same as I would
download from the CBT web site, except that the SYMBSUB member
has been updated.  I did not attempt to modify any of the other
members to match.

In case it is of use, here is a description of the changes that
have been made since the original submission:

    1) Fixed a critical bug that caused SYMBSUB to incorrectly
       handle symbolic values passed on EXEC PROC statements.
    2) Corrected a minor bug that caused SYMBSUB to fail to find
       his own JCL in the active queue if the submitting user had
       various SDSF filters set.

Let me know if I you need any further information from me.

Thanks,
Bill Bass
