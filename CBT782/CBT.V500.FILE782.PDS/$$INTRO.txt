Fish's AWS/HET File Browser Utility

AWSBrowse

Version 1.5.2

------------------------------------------------------------------

Overview / Description


This is a much improved and more powerful version of Rob Storey's
existing 'awsbrows.exe' utility (note spelling).  Awsbrows.exe
(withOUT the 'e') is Rob's program.  AwsbrowsE.exe (WITH the 'e')
is my own much more powerful version of the same thing.

Rob's awsbrows is a handy utility (and until my AWSBrowse came
along the only utility), but it was too lacking in features to be
useful for my own purposes so I decided to write a better one.

Among it's many features are:

" Significantly faster than existing awsbrows.exe
" More functional and user-friendly user-interface
" Supports both .aws and .het files, including spanned block files
" Supports both ZLIB and BZIP2 compressed het file formats (DLLs
  included), as well as Bus-Tech ZLIB compressed files too.
" User configurable hex display (font and layout)
" Hex/text search capability. Find whatever data you're looking for.
" Displays both EBCDIC or ASCII
" Ditto-like toolbar buttons for quick positioning to
  next/previous block/file
" Detection/reporting of all Standard Labels
" Detailed tape summary statistics including StdLbl info
" GoTo command for direct access to start of any StdLbl file
" Clipboard support for hex/text/binary data.  Hex data copied
  from AWSBrowse can be pasted into Visual Studio's binary file
  editor.
" Printing and Print Preview support (single selected blocks only)
" Supports large block sizes (greater than 64K)
" Supports extremely large files (greater than 4GB)

This is a must-have utility for anyone dealing with many AWS/HET
files.


------------------------------------------------------------------


VERSION 1.5.2


" New project build system: NullSoft (NSIS) installation program.
" Use different 32/64-bit zlib1/libbz2 DLL names.


------------------------------------------------------------------


VERSION 1.5.1


" VS2005 + x64 (64-bit) support (requires VS2005 64-bit FishLib)
" Added "File -> Close" command.
" Load zlib/bzip2 DLLs at startup
" Trailing garbage detection/recovery
" Recognize Bus-Tech hardware compression flag
" Add support for Bus-Tech segmented-block flag
" Registration of file-type associations w/default icons (see below)
" Tape summary == detailed statistics including StdLbl information
" New "Go To..." command to go directly to start of any StdLbl file
" Minor UI glitch-fix: Block Details & Tape Summary dialogs s/b
  read-only

  Tapemark blocks

follow the instructions.  Same goes with uninstalling.

Building AWSBrowse


To successfully build AWSBrowse from source, you will first need
to gather some needed pieces from other places around the web.
My Setup program/project does not do this for you.  It only
packages my own stuff (and Microsoft's vcredist of course) but
not anyone else's stuff, so you'll have to manually acquire the
other needed pieces for yourself.

The pieces you'll need are:

 NSIS (Nullsoft Scriptable Install System)
 WinZip Pro (or gzip with some extensive changes)
 verinfo (a very handy utility by Magnus BÂ¯ck)
 egrep (win32 port of Unix utility)
 cut (win32 port of Unix utility)
 sed (win32 port of Unix utility)
 u2d (win32 port of Unix utility)
 wc (win32 port of Unix utility)

NSIS (Nullsoft Scriptable Install System:
http://nsis.sourceforge.net/Main_Page) is free.  WinZip
Professional is NOT FREE however.  I apologize for that.  I could
replace it with a free gzip/zlib alternative, but haven't
bothered to do that yet.  I leave doing that as an exercise to
the reader should he/she wish to do so.

The "verinfo" utility as well as the other utilities (egrep, cut,
sed, etc) are free and can be found on the web with with minimal
effort.  One such place where verinfo can be found is
http://www.jsifaq.com/SF/Tips/Tip.aspx?id=7475.

The cut, sed, etc.  utilities are pure Win32 ports of Unix/Linux
tools that are available from either of the "UnxUtils" and/or
"GnuWin32" packages.  The URLs are:
http://unxutils.sourceforge.net/,
http://gnuwin32.sourceforge.net/.  Take your pick.  Place the
utilities into a directory somewhere and add that directory to
your Windows PATH so Windows (and thus the project build system)
can find them.

You'll also need to add the NSIS directory to your PATH as well,
as well as do a few other minor manual installation things too
for the Setup project (discussed next).  Once you've done all
that (and it seems like a lot but it's not really), then
AWSBrowse -- as well as any of my other products you may wish to
build from source -- should all build just fine.

The Setup project is designed to use the Nullsoft Scriptable
Install System (download URL:
http://nsis.sourceforge.net/Main_Page).

After installing NSIS you'll still need to make some more changes
before AWSBrowse (the Setup project specifically) will build
properly.  The changes are quite trivial and only need to be done
once of course.

After installing NSIS (and adding its installation directory to
your Windows search PATH), create a subdirectory beneath the main
NSIS installation directory's 'include' directory called 'local',
and then copy the:

 CkIfInst.nsh
 Debug64.nsh
 EnvVar.nsh
 GetParms.nsh
 VCRedist.nsh

NSIS header files into it, so that the directory structure looks
like this:


 %ProgramFiles%
  NSIS
   Include
    local <---<<< local modifications directory
     CkIfInst.nsh
     Debug64.nsh
     EnvVar.nsh
     GetParms.nsh
     VCRedist.nsh
    Colors.nsh
    FileFunc.nsh
    Library.nsh
    LogicLib.nsh
    ...etc...


The "Debug64.nsh", "EnvVar.nsh" and "VCRedist.nsh" files are NSIS
header files that the Setup project requires that do not come
with the NSIS product.  They're scripts that other people
(including myself) have written that help make it a tad bit
easier to do certain things.

All local modifications to the NSIS product (custom header files)
that you or anyone else create should be placed in the NSIS
"local include" subdirectory.  That's not a NSIS requirement, but
rather just good common sense made into a requirement by myself.
;-)

That's it.  That's all you have to do.  And you only need to do
it once too.  From then on, the Setup project should build just
fine for you.
