//*           program to run on the PC (Personal Computer) under    *   FILE 782
//*           Windows.  The purpose of the program is to be able    *   FILE 782
//*           to browse tapes in AWS-format and other formats       *   FILE 782

//*     This is a much improved and more powerful version of        *   FILE 782
//*     Rob Storey's existing 'awsbrows.exe' utility (note          *   FILE 782
