Awsbrows.exe\n(withOUT the 'e') is Rob's program.  AwsbrowsE.exe (WITH the 'e')\nis my own much more powerful version of the same thing.\n\nRob's awsbrows is a handy utility (and until my AWSBrowse came\nalong the only utility), but it was too lacking in features to be\nuseful for my own purposes so I decided to write a better one.\n\nAmong it's many features are:\n\n\" Significantly faster than existing awsbrows.exe\n\" More functional and user-friendly user-interface\n\" Supports both .aws and .het files, including spanned block files\n\" Supports both ZLIB and BZIP2 compressed het file formats (DLLs\n  included), as well as Bus-Tech ZLIB compressed files too.\n\" User configurable hex display (font and layout)\n\" Hex/text search capability. Find whatever data you're looking for.\n\" Displays both EBCDIC or ASCII\n\" Ditto-like toolbar buttons for quick positioning to\n  next/previous block/file\n\" Detection/reporting of all Standard Labels\n\" Detailed tape summary statistics including StdLbl info\n\" GoTo command for direct access to start of any StdLbl file\n\" Clipboard support for hex/text/binary data.  Hex data copied\n  from AWSBrowse can be pasted into Visual Studio's binary file\n  editor.\n\" Printing and Print Preview support (single selected blocks only)\n\" Supports large block sizes (greater than 64K)\n\" Supports extremely large files (greater than 4GB)\n\nThis is a must-have utility for anyone dealing with many AWS/HET\nfiles.\n\n\n------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n\nVERSION 1.5.2\n\n\n\" New project build system: NullSoft (NSIS) installation program.\n\" Use different 32/64-bit zlib1/libbz2 DLL names.\n\n\n------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n\nVERSION 1.5.1\n\n\n\" VS2005 + x64 (64-bit) support (requires VS2005 64-bit FishLib)\n\" Added \"File -> Close\" command.\n\" Load zlib/bzip2 DLLs at startup\n\" Trailing garbage detection/recovery\n\" Recognize Bus-Tech hardware compression flag\n\" Add support for Bus-Tech segmented-block flag\n\" Registration of file-type associations w/default icons (see below)\n\" Tape summary == detailed statistics including StdLbl information\n\" New \"Go To...\" command to go directly to start of any StdLbl file\n\" Minor UI glitch-fix: Block Details & Tape Summary dialogs s/b\n  read-only\n\" Minor UI glitch-fix: Print/Print-Preview s/b disabled for\n  Tapemark blocks\n\" Update to latest version of BCMenu\n\n\n------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n\nInstallation\n\n\nTo install AWSBrowse, simply run the installation program and\nfollow the instructions.  Same goes with uninstalling.\n\n\n------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n\nBuilding AWSBrowse\n\n\nTo successfully build AWSBrowse from source, you will first need\nto gather some needed pieces from other places around the web.\nMy Setup program/project does not do this for you.  It only\npackages my own stuff (and Microsoft's vcredist of course) but\nnot anyone else's stuff, so you'll have to manually acquire the\nother needed pieces for yourself.\n\nThe pieces you'll need are:\n\n NSIS (Nullsoft Scriptable Install System)\n WinZip Pro (or gzip with some extensive changes)\n verinfo (a very handy utility by Magnus B\u00afck)\n egrep (win32 port of Unix utility)\n cut (win32 port of Unix utility)\n sed (win32 port of Unix utility)\n u2d (win32 port of Unix utility)\n wc (win32 port of Unix utility)\n\nNSIS (Nullsoft Scriptable Install System:\nhttp://nsis.sourceforge.net/Main_Page) is free.  WinZip\nProfessional is NOT FREE however.  I apologize for that.  I could\nreplace it with a free gzip/zlib alternative, but haven't\nbothered to do that yet.  I leave doing that as an exercise to\nthe reader should he/she wish to do so.\n\nThe \"verinfo\" utility as well as the other utilities (egrep, cut,\nsed, etc) are free and can be found on the web with with minimal\neffort.  One such place where verinfo can be found is\nhttp://www.jsifaq.com/SF/Tips/Tip.aspx?id=7475.\n\nThe cut, sed, etc.  utilities are pure Win32 ports of Unix/Linux\ntools that are available from either of the \"UnxUtils\" and/or\n\"GnuWin32\" packages.  The URLs are:\nhttp://unxutils.sourceforge.net/,\nhttp://gnuwin32.sourceforge.net/.  Take your pick.  Place the\nutilities into a directory somewhere and add that directory to\nyour Windows PATH so Windows (and thus the project build system)\ncan find them.\n\nYou'll also need to add the NSIS directory to your PATH as well,\nas well as do a few other minor manual installation things too\nfor the Setup project (discussed next).  Once you've done all\nthat (and it seems like a lot but it's not really), then\nAWSBrowse -- as well as any of my other products you may wish to\nbuild from source -- should all build just fine.\n\nThe Setup project is designed to use the Nullsoft Scriptable\nInstall System (download URL:\nhttp://nsis.sourceforge.net/Main_Page).\n\nAfter installing NSIS you'll still need to make some more changes\nbefore AWSBrowse (the Setup project specifically) will build\nproperly.  The changes are quite trivial and only need to be done\nonce of course.\n\nAfter installing NSIS (and adding its installation directory to\nyour Windows search PATH), create a subdirectory beneath the main\nNSIS installation directory's 'include' directory called 'local',\nand then copy the:\n\n CkIfInst.nsh\n Debug64.nsh\n EnvVar.nsh\n GetParms.nsh\n VCRedist.nsh\n\nNSIS header files into it, so that the directory structure looks\nlike this:\n\n\n %ProgramFiles%\n  NSIS\n   Include\n    local <---<<< local modifications directory\n     CkIfInst.nsh\n     Debug64.nsh\n     EnvVar.nsh\n     GetParms.nsh\n     VCRedist.nsh\n    Colors.nsh\n    FileFunc.nsh\n    Library.nsh\n    LogicLib.nsh\n    ...etc...\n\n\nThe \"Debug64.nsh\", \"EnvVar.nsh\" and \"VCRedist.nsh\" files are NSIS\nheader files that the Setup project requires that do not come\nwith the NSIS product.  They're scripts that other people\n(including myself) have written that help make it a tad bit\neasier to do certain things.\n\nAll local modifications to the NSIS product (custom header files)\nthat you or anyone else create should be placed in the NSIS\n\"local include\" subdirectory.  That's not a NSIS requirement, but\nrather just good common sense made into a requirement by myself.\n;-)\n\nThat's it.  That's all you have to do.  And you only need to do\nit once too.  From then on, the Setup project should build just\nfine for you.\n\n\n", "mimetype": "text/plain", "datatype": "ebcdic", "extension": ".txt"}, "@FILE782": {"ttr": 522, "alias": false, "halfwords": 30, "notes": 0, "parms": "b'\\x04M\\x00\\x00\\x01\\x08\\x12_\\x01\\x08\\x12_\\x02\\x01\\x00R\\x00R\\x00\\x00\\xc3\\xc2\\xe3`\\xf4\\xf7\\xf7@@@'", "ispf": {"version": "04.77", "flags": 0, "createdate": "2008-05-04T00:00:00", "modifydate": "2008-05-04T02:01:00", "lines": 82, "newlines": 82, "modlines": 0, "user": "CBT-477"}, "text": "//***FILE 782 is from David B.
