Hello Sam!

I have found a minor bug in my rexx program "PRTLAN" that
you have fitted into CBT-V479 some time ago.

The problem is in regard to the building of PostScript code in
batch execution.

Now it is OK and works in full capability whether in interactive
ISPF session that in batch mode by a job.

I just added one JCL member with example for execution.

Should be appropriate to update the 832 file with the right
program version.

Thanks in advance for everything.

Bye bye,
Marco S.
