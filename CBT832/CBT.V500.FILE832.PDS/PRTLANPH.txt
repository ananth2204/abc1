+  PRTLAN allows you to print any dataset or PDS member directly
+  from your ISPF EDIT session to any defined LAN printer.
+  Alternatively, you can invoke PRTLAN as TSO command or even in
+  batch as follows: %PRTLAN yourPrinter yourFile+.
+
+  In ISPF EDIT you can simply select %S+ the printer you want to
+  send the data to or manage the list of defined printers
+  directly from the provided ISPF interface.
+
+  To do so, overtype the field contaning %NO+ with other%MOD+to
+  modify,%INS+to insert or%DEL+to delete. Then select the
+  printer you want to perform your action against and press%ENTER+.
+
+  To view just a subset of all defined LAN printers, just overtype
+  the top line field filled with asterisks by specifying a mask of
+  your choice and then press%ENTER+.
+
+  Now you can use different printing formats further that landscape
+  with 132 characters by 60 lines in 10 pt. by select%E+in replace
+  of S, and than choose among 4 types, %PORT+-%WIDE+-%LAND+%2UP+.
