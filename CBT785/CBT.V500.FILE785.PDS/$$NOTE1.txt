Hello Sam,

At the moment I send you an update for my ICSF Monitor and my
litte edit macro to use system symbols in JCL.

The submit macro are in real two REXX and one edit macro.  The
REXXs are:

SUBC  - to change any symbols and directly submit the
        job.
SUBCC - to change the symbols and show the final JCL for
        checking. Both are using the edit macro #SUBCMAC.

Have a nice day and all the best for you and your family.

Kind regards, Karl-Heinz.
