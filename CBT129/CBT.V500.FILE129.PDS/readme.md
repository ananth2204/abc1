Hi Sam,

Attached to this email is a file with two zaps.  The zaps are for
allowing CHECKPOINT RESTART processing on shared DASD.  I have put a
comment in each one specifying which release of OS/390 and DFSMS
they fit.  Please add this to the CBTTAPE; maybe someone else would
like to do this as well.

                              Thanks,
                               Jim
