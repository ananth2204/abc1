  ERROR DESCRIPTION:
  The current design of SMTP does NOT support a translate @
  character which is documented as a special character in the SMTP
  RFCs. Some languages need this translation capability. For
  example, a customer using a Finnish/Swedish codepage is unable
  to use SMTP. The @ character that is used throughout SMTP as a
  part of internet addressing is hardcoded to x'7C', due to
  compilation with a codepage that maps it there. In other
  codepages, the @ character is mapped to other values, and mail
  traffic addresses will not be interpreted correctly. Therefore,
  SMTP will not correctly process addresses if it is running on a
  system that has a codepage that does not map @ to x'7C'.

  PROBLEM SUMMARY:
  ****************************************************************
  * USERS AFFECTED: All users of the Communications Server       *
  *                 for OS/390 Release 6, 7, 8 and 10 IP: SMTP   *

  * PROBLEM DESCRIPTION: SMTP hardcoded @ symbol is not          *
  *                      compatible with certain languages       *

  * RECOMMENDATION:                                              *
  ****************************************************************
  The current design of SMTP does not support a translate @
  character which is documented as a special character in the SMTP
  RFCs. Some languages need this translation capability, so that
  the hexadecimal encoding for the @ symbol can be something other
  than x'7C'.

  PROBLEM CONCLUSION:


  TEMPORARY FIX:


  COMMENTS:
  SMTP code has been modified to handle a substitution symbol for
  the @ symbol. This modification does NOT support installations
  that make use of the RFC 822 header rewrite rules. If you make
  use of that support, you cannot use this feature. This change
  is equivalent in function to VM APAR PN59425.

  The following documentation changes have been made:

  ================================================================
  OS/390 Communications Server
  IP Configuration
  Document Number SC31-8513

  and for OS/390 Release 10 IP

  OS/390 Communications Server
  IP Configuration Reference
  Document Number SC31-8726

  Chapter "Configuring the SMTP Server", Step 3 Update the System
  CLIST and PARMLIB Data Sets, under the customized variables
  in SMTPNOTE CLIST add the following:

    ATSIGN     Some foreign languages need to use a different
               character to represent the @ symbol. This input
               symbol is a single byte representation of the
               @ symbol in their national language codepage.

  Chapter "Configuring the SMTP Server", Step 6 Summary of SMTP
  Configuration Statements, add the ATSIGN statement and the
  description "Enables SMTP to replace the @ symbol used in
  addressing strings".

  Chapter "SMTP Configuration Data Set Statements", add the
  ATSIGN Statement

    Use the ATSIGN statement to specify that you want SMTP to use
    this character in the addressing strings generated by SMTP.
    This might affect your operability between sites using
    different code pages.

    Syntax

    >>----ATSIGN--symbol--------------------->

    Parameters
    symbol     The input symbol which is a single byte
               representation of the @ symbol in their national
               language codepage.

    Usage Note:
    If this statement is not specified, then SMTP will default to


    using the @ symbol (defined as a value '7C'x).
    For details on EBCDIC character set definitions see book
    "3174 Character Set Reference", document number GA27-3831.

    The ATSIGN statement cannot be used in combination with the
    REWRITE822HEADER statement. REWRITE822HEADER defaults to YES,
    and you must set this to NO in your SMTP configuration file if
    you wish to use ATSIGN. The REWRITE822HEADER statement needs
    to come before the ATSIGN statement.

    Note: If the ATSIGN statement was used previously, and you are
    assigning a new symbol for that statement, you need to ensure
    that all the mail has been sent. If old mail exists that is
    using the old symbol, then problems could occur.

    EZA5343I Translated ATSIGN symbol       : symbol

    Explanation: The ATSIGN statement in the hlq.SMTP.CONFIG file
    has been set. Setting this statement means that SMTP will use
    this symbol instead of the @ symbol between the user ID and
    host ID fields in addressing strings, for example,
    userid@hostid This statement should only be used for specific
    languages because of translation encodings.

    Setting this option may cause problems if notes are being sent
    between different language sites. In the message text:

      symbol     The input symbol replacing the @ symbol.

    For more information about the ATSIGN configuration statement,
    see OS/390 Communications Server: IP Configuration.

    System Action: SMTP continues

    User or Operator Response: None

    System Programmer Response: None

    Source Data Set: SMTP

    Procedure Name: OpenOutputStreams

    --------------------------------------------------------------



    EZA5344E Incorrect ATSIGN symbol specified: symbol

    Explanation: The input symbol replacing the @ symbol must be
    just 1 character in length. The specified input symbol is too
    large. In the message text:

      symbol    The input string replacing the @ symbol.

    For more information about the ATSIGN configuration statement
    see OS/390 Communications Server: IP Configuration.

    System Action: SMTP ends.

    User or Operator Response: None

    System Programmer Response: Change the input string specified
    in the ATSIGN configuration statement to one character.
    Restart SMTP.

    Source Data Set: SMTP

    Procedure Name: ProcessConfigFile

    --------------------------------------------------------------

    EZA5345E Option conflict: the ATSIGN symbol and default
             REWRITE822HEADER table can not both be active

    Explanation: The translate ATSIGN and REWRITE822HEADER cannot
    both be activated because the default REWRITE822HEADER table
    contains a hardcoded @ character that cannot be modified.
    Therefore, these options cannot be used together.

    For more information about the configuration statements see
    OS/390 Communications Server: IP Configuration.

    System Action: SMTP ends.

    User or Operator Response: None

    System Programmer Response: Select one of the two options to
    activate in the :hlq.SMTP.CONFIG file. Restart SMTP

    Source Data Set: SMTP

    Procedure Name: ProcessConfigFile
