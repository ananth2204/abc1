You should have
   HTTP.SOURCE            source
   HTTP.MACLIB            assembler macros
   HTTP.JCL               JCL
   HTML                   sample HTML
   GIF                    some GIF images



You will need to allocate an OBJECT and LOAD library
          Space    DIR blocks       DCB

OBJECT    5 tracks   5              RECFM=FB,LRECL=80,BLKSIZE=3120
LOAD     10 tracks   5              RECFM=U,BLKSIZE=6144




Edit the JCL
  - add valid JOB cards
  - change the "........" DSN prefixes

Run ASMLINK
    ASMAPP1
    ASMAPP2
    ASMAPP3
    ASMSUB


In the HTML library member MENU, change the "xxxxxxxx" on the
href statements under "Server" to the hostname of system where
you will run the server.


Start up the main address space (member main of this library)
Start up APP1, APP2, and/or APP3


The server should running.


You should be able to enter
"http://hostname:port/main/menu"


  where hostname is the IP hostname of the system where the server
  is running.  port is the port number used on the PORT statement
  in the "MAIN" space's start up JCL.

If you used port 1000,
 the URL would be "http://hostname:1000/main/menu"
