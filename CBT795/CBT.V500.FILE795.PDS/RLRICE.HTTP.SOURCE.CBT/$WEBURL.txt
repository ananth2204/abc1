Secondary server spaces "register" or "define" URLs with the main
server space.  A URL can be specific or a prefix.

An example of specific URLs are the URLs processed by HTTPAPP2.
HTTPAPP2 registers "ACT", "APF", and "LNK".  If the main space
receives a URL like "http://server/apf", it "knows" to send the
URL to HTTPAPP2.  If the URL was "http://server/applist", it
would not "match" any defined URL.

An example of a prefix type URLs are the URLs registerd by HTTPAPP1.
HTTPAPP1 returns members of PDS(es).  It registers URLs that look
like "http://ddname" where ddname is a DD present in the HTTPAPP1
JCL.  So if in the start up JCL for HTTPAPP1 there is a DD like
"//GIFS    DD   DSN=xxxx.GIFS,DISP=SHR"
HTTPAPP1 would register a URL "http://server/GIFS".  Then if the
HTTP server receives a URL from a web client like
"http://server/GIFS/LOGO", the main space would know to send the
URL to HTTPAPP1.  HTTPAPP1 would send the web client the contents
of member LOGO of the data set "xxxxx.GIFS".

Parameters (data following the question mark (?)) is not considered
for matching specific URLs.  So "http://server/ITEM?abc123" would
match the specific URL "http://server/ITEM".  The question mark and
the "abc123" would be ignored for matching the URL.  This means
that the "ITEM" processing secondary space would receive the URL
and it could use the "abc123" as the key to a VSAM KSDS, DB2 table
query, etc.
