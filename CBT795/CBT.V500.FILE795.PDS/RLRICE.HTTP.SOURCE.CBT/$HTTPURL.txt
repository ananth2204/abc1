What is the HTTPURL subtask for?

When secondary server spaces start up, they "register" or
"define" URLs that they "know how to process".
The HTTPURL subtask manages a data space of these "registered" URLs.


Since secondary spaces and web clients can contact the HTTP server
at any time, it is necessary to make sure the list of URLs is not
being updated by two different "things" at the same time.  Also
we don't want to be "looking up" a URL while a new URL is being
registered.  Using a subtask to manage the list of URLs causes the
registration or lookups of URLs to be serialized or single-threaded.
Since there is only one subtask that can update the list of
registered URLs, there is no need to ENQ or lock the list while
it is being updated.

It may sound like a bit of a bottle neck, but the URL manager is
only updating/looking up in-core info.


The information stored for a URL includes the SERVBLOK address for
the HTTPSERV subtask that manages communication with a specific
remote server, and the CLIENT ID used for the GIVESOCKET/TAKESOCKET.
