Sam,
It seems that the web is the 'in' thing nowadays.

We had IBM's websphere web server.  It has since been shutdown on
our system.  It was not easy or straightforward to configure.

I would imagine there a lot of mainframers out there that would
like to make some info available via the web.  If they were like
me, I felt the web servers available were slanted heavily toward
the unix world.

I thought others may be interested in a web server that was
easier to configure.  It is also written in user-friendly
assembler language instead of that gosh awful "C".  It certainly
does not have the amount of function of the Apache or IBM
websphere servers.  I started on this utility with the thought
that I would learn something about TCP/IP and the web.  If I got
it working, great, if not.. Well hopefully I still learned
something.  I never did get it working satisfactorily.  I
designed what there is with multiple subtasks with the thought
that if it was running on a machine

With multiple CPUs, it could benefit from splitting up the work
among the CPUs.  I suspect there is  a timing issue in passing
work

Between the subtasks.  I worked with IBM TCP/IP support a little
and got past a few snags.

It always works for a number of (for a lack of a better term)
transactions.  Then for some reason that I never figured out, it
will

Start getting TCP/IP write errors.  Once it gets one error, it
seems that all subsequent WRITEs fail.

Anyway if anyone you know would want to work with it, here's what
I've got.

I do NOT expect this to be put on the CBT.  At least not as is.
Don't mis-understand, you're free to do what ever you want with
it.

I also am including some sample HTML and GIFs that I used for testing.
