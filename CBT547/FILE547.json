As a consequence, I\ndecided to add this page to the hercules site. It will contain\nutilities for MVS and/or Windows that might make life easier for\nthe MVS enthusiast. Those utilities will be added to this page\nwhenever a new one becomes available.  If you want to contribute\nyour own utilities, fell free to do so.\n\nI have decided to make those utilities that I write/salvage from\nold code/pry out of someone's cold hands in source form and load\nmodule form as well. For assembly I will rely on the turnkey\nsystem, i.e. you will need SYS2.MACLIB (which might be updated\nfrom time to time as well), and the resulting load modules will\nbe placed into SYS2.LINKLIB (for STC and BATCH programs) or\nSYS2.CMDLIB (for TSO CPs)\n\nObviously, I cannot guarantee that these programs really will\nwork, you will have to take the full risk of useability etc.\nRemember? You get what you paid for, and even more than that....\n\nList of modules\n\n   * BSPVTMWT - Wait for VTAM to become active\n   * ZAPDSCB - Modify VTOC entries in batch\n   * JESMOD01 - JES2 Modification to display MAXCC at job end\n   * PCLOVL - PCL Overlays to allow \"green bar\" printing on PCL\n     printers\n   * COOKIE - The Fortune Cookie Jar\n   * PILOT - MVS Autopilot that runs scripts, replies to WTOR,\n     reacts on WTOS, etc\n   * SETPF - A utility to set the Console Function keys from a\n     SYS1.PARMLIB member\n   * APFCK - A utility to check the contents of IEAAPFxx members\n     of SYS1.PARMLIB\n   * DISKM - A Disk Mapper\n   * # - The famous # command subsystem\n\nList of modules\n\nBSPVTMWT - Wait for VTAM to Initialize\n\nDon't you hate unnecessary and repeating work? Well, typing\n\n1retry\n\non the MVS console cannot really be called \"work\", but it is\nunnecessary nevertheless. Whenever the MVS Turnkey system starts,\nthe network (VTAM, NET) and TSO will be started automatically.\nUnfortunately, TSO is usually faster in its startup processing\nthan VTAM and complains that it cannot accept logons. The reason\nis that NET hasn't finished initialising yet and hasn't made the\nTSO ACB available.\n\nIn comes the program BSPVTMWT - which waits for VTAM to make an\nACB available.\n\nJust prepend it to the PROC/JOB step that is to start a VTAM\napplication.  For TSO this would look similar to\n\n//TSO     PROC MEM=00\n//WAITTSO EXEC PGM=BSPVTMWT,PARM='TSO'\n//TSO     EXEC PGM=IKTCAS00,TIME=1440\n//PARMLIB  DD  DISP=SHR,DSN=SYS1.PARMLIB(TSOKEY&MEM),FREE=CLOSE\n//PRINTOUT DD  SYSOUT=A,DCB=(LRECL=133,RECFM=FBB)\n\nBSPVTMWT will now try 10 times (with an interval of 10 seconds in\nbetween) to open the VTAM ACB. If if succeeds, it will close it\nagain and finish, and now TSO can grab the available ACB\n\nYou can change the number of retries by modifying the code and\nrecompiling and relinking. In line 1 there is\n\nMAXTRIES EQU 10\n\nWhich determines how often the program will retry to open the\nACB. Also you will find a variable\n\nINTERVAL DC C'00001000'\n\nWhich contains the interval between tries.\n\nRunning the member ASMLKG will assemble and link the whole thing\nBe sure to check the JCL for local naming conventions. You will\nneed the SYS2.MACLIB from the turnkey system in order to\nsuccessfully assemble the program\n\nBSPVTMWT - The Archive\n\nYou can download the utility as a zip or a tar file. The contents\nin both files are identical\n\n   * vtamwt.aws - a hercules tape file\n   * vtamwt.jcl - JCL to load the tape to your MVS system\n   * vtamwt.map - map of tape\n\nUnpack both files into a directory of your choice. Adjust the JCL\nto your needs. Then, at the hercules console, enter\n\ndevinit 480,[yourdir/]vtamwt.aws\ndevinit 00c,[yourdir/]vtamwt.jcl eof\n\nA Job should now be started that loads VTAMWAIT into your system.\nYou can now, for example, modify the TSO procedure in SYS1.PROCLIB\nas shown above, and next time you start MVS there is no need any\nmore for the\n\nr 01,retry\n\nreply\n\nList of modules\n\nZAPDSCB - Modify VTOC entries via Batch\n\nThe MVS turnkey system provides a utility CDSCB (for Change DSCB)\nwith which you can modify VTOC entries in a TSO session. This is\nusually sufficient, but sometimes to need to do more (like\nmass-mode changing of expiration dates). In this case a batch\nversion comes in handy. It has been emailed to me by\nsomitcw_at_erols.com, I just compiled and tested it, and it works\nflawlessly.\n\nHow do you use this utility? Very simple - by plain JCL. No\ncontrol statements, no input or output files, just good old JCL.\nYou will need an EXEC statement for the program, of course, and\none DD statement fro each dataset whose VTOC entry you want to\nmodify. The DD-Name for these data sets must begin with the 3\ncharacters ZAP. Then the attributes to be changed follow:\n\n//MODVTOC EXEC PGM=ZAPDSCB\n//*     Set expiration date\n//ZAP1     DD  DISP=SHR,DSN=MY.DASD.DATASET,LABEL=EXPDT=73150\n//*     Remove expiration date\n//ZAP2     DD  DISP=SHR,DSN=MY.DASD.DATASET,LABEL=RETPD=0\n//*     Modify secondary space allocation\n//ZAP3     DD  DISP=SHR,DSN=MY.DASD.DATASET,SPACE=(CYL,(0,2))\n//*     Remove any password protection\n//ZAP4     DD  DISP=SHR,DSN=MY.DASD.DATASET,FCB=NOPW\n//*     Remove any read password protection\n//ZAP5     DD  DISP=SHR,DSN=MY.DASD.DATASET,LABEL=(,,NOPWREAD)\n//*     Reactivate password protection\n//ZAP6     DD  DISP=SHR,DSN=MY.DASD.DATASET,LABEL=(,,PASSWORD)\n//* The following attributes can also be changed:\n//*    LRECL\n//*    BLKSIZE\n//*    DSORG\n//*    RECFM\n//*    OPTCD\n\nZAPDSCB - The Archive\n\nYou can download the utility as a zip or a tar file.

Then, at the hercules console,\nenter\n\ndevinit 00c,[yourdir/]zapdscb.jcl eof\n\nA Job should now be started that loads ZAPDSCB into your system.\nThe target library for the load module must be authorized.

The\ninformation provided is just if the job ended normally or\nabnormally. The JES modification presented here enhances the\ninformation in such a way, that the highest condition code of all\nthe steps in the job is provided as well, or the (last)\nAbend-code encountered in the Job.\n\nJESMOD01 - The Archive\n\nYou can download the modification as a zip or a tar file.

Then, at the hercules console,\nenter\n\ndevinit 480,[yourdir/]jesmod01.aws\ndevinit 00c,[yourdir/]jesmod01.jcl eof\n\nA Job should now be started that loads JESMOD01 into your system.\n\nBefore installing the modifications into the live system you\nshould make sure to be able to have a fallback mechanism in place\nin case things go wrong. You should either have a fresh backup of\nyour system residence volume MVSRES, or , if you are using shadow\nfiles, you should now create a new shadow file generation before\nproceeding. You can now install the actual modification in one of\ntwo ways\n\nYou can now install the actual modification in one of two ways\n\n  1. Run job JESMOD01 from dataset SYS1.JESMODS.CNTL\n     This will assemble two JES modules and places them into\n     SYS1.LINKLIB or SYS1.LPALIB\n  2. Copy the contents of SYS1.JESMODS.LPALIB to SYS1.LPALIB\n     Copy the contents of SYS1.JESMODS.LINKLIB to SYS1.LINKLIB\n     replacing the existing members\n\nNow shudown your system. Perform an IPL with the CLPA option.\nFrom now on you should see the maximum return coe in the\nend-of-job messages sent to your TSO user at job end\n\nList of modules\n\nPCL Overlays for \"green bar\" printing\n\nWhile we are doing retrocomputing anyhow, why not bring back the\n\"green bar\" print output? Well, not really green bar, bar grey\nbar output. Here are a few PCL printer overlays that will bring\nthe good old feeling back - One caveat: They have been made with\nA4 paper size in mind, I don't know what they look like on the\nAmerican paper sizes 11\" or legal, but you can always try, and\nchange. If you make changes to them for the nonstandard sizes,\nplease send them to me an I can incorporate them in this page\n\nThe Archive\n\nThe overlays are available in zip and in compressed tar format.\nThe contents of the archive is identical. There are several files\nin the archive, whith the following naming convention\n\n   Lds66132.ovl\n   !!!! !  !\n   !!!! !  +----- .ovl = overlay file\n   !!!! !         .txt = text file explaining parameters\n   !!!! +-------- number of columns per page\n   !!!+---------- number of lines per page\n   !!+----------- constant \"s\"\n   !+------------ s = simplex\n   !              d = duplex\n   +------------- L = Landscape\n                  P = Portrait\n\nList of modules\n\nFortune Cookies, R2D2, and other goodies\n\nThis package contains multiple, only loosely related bit and\npieces. They are source, and as ready to run load modules:\n\n   * COOKIE: Some of you enjoy my little cat and the bits of\n     wisdom it dispenses out of the fortune cookie jar. Here is\n     the MVS version of the cookie jar\n   * PILOT: The MVS autopilot. Reacts to WTOs and WTORs, runs\n     scripts from the OS console, and does other nice stuff as\n     well\n   * APFCK: Every having a strange problem with modules not\n     running authorized, when they should have? Usually the cause\n     is some error in IEAAPFxx. This little utility checks the\n     entries in all IEAAPFxx members for correctnes.\n   * SETPF: Defining the function keys on the MVS console can be\n     a tedious process (and it has to be done all over again\n     after a sysgen). This little utility reads members SETPFKxx\n     from SYS1.PARMLIB and assigns function key definitions to\n     the MVS consoles (SETPFK01 id for console id 01, SETPFK02\n     for Console 2, and so on). Running this utility right after\n     IPL (or as part of the autopilot) will give you the settings\n     without any hassle at all.\n   * RUNSC: Running operator commands from batch? No problem.\n     RUNSC program runs scripts of MVS commands (Actually, it is\n     a stand alone part of the Autopilot)\n   * DISKM: A Disk mapper. Lists the contents, layout, track\n     utilization, whatever from a single DASD unit, or from all\n     DASD units in the system\n   * #: the famius # command subsystem. Adds lots of additional\n     commands to the MVS console interface.\n\nBSP38J - The Archive\n\nYou can download the archive as a zip or a tar file.

The easy way,\nand the long (but not really hard) way\n\nYou should choose the easy way if you trust precompiled versions of\nprograms.  Then, the only thing you need to do is run the job\n                            EZINST$\nin this dataset.\n\nThen you should read the documentation members (member names end with\na \"@\")\n\nNow update SYS1.PARMLIB(COMMND00) with the data in COMMND01\n\nNow update SYS1.PARMLIB(IEASYS00) and add a line\n\n   FIX=00,\n\n(don't forget the comma)\n\nAdd or update IEAFIX00 to contain the line\n\nSYS1.LPALIB CMDDUMMY\n\nFinally, pray for the best and do an IPL with the CLPA option\n\nAnd what is the hard way?  Work yourself through the file\n$$README, and through the JCL members in this file (they end in a \"$\").\n\nSample JCL can be found in members ending with a \"#\"\n\nIn any case, you should work through the members CBTxx, which\nreorganize the catalog structure of the CBT files in the\nturnkey system\nIf you have any problems, send me an email\n\n         vbandke@bsp-gmbh.com\n\n./ ADD NAME=$$README 8018-74014-74083-1027-00051-00015-00000-HERC01\nThis collection assumes that you have installed the MVS Turnkey\nsystem.
