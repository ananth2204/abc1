//***FILE 257 is from Sam Golob, and contains zaps to fix the       *   FILE 257
//*           old linkage editor (even if it is part of DFSMS),     *   FILE 257
//*           so that it will read object decks that are blocked    *   FILE 257
//*           bigger than 3200 bytes per block.  For your perusal   *   FILE 257
//*           and pleasure....  (Block size max set to 32720.)      *   FILE 257

//*   FIXING YOUR OLD LINKAGE EDITOR  (IN DFSMS/MVS TOO)            *   FILE 257
//*                                                                 *   FILE 257
//*   EVEN UNDER DFSMS/MVS, WITH HEWL AND IEWL BEING THE NEW        *   FILE 257
//*   'BINDER', YOU CAN STILL RUN THE OLD LINKAGE EDITOR IF YOU     *   FILE 257
//*   SAY EXEC PGM=HEWLKED.  IBM HAS KEPT A VERSION OF THE OLD      *   FILE 257
//*   LINKAGE EDITOR AROUND.  HOWEVER, WITH THE BINDER, IBM HAS     *   FILE 257
//*   REMOVED THE OLD (NOW STUPID) RESTRICTION THAT OBJECT DECKS    *   FILE 257
//*   CAN'T BE BLOCKED GREATER THAN 3200 BYTES, OR 40 RECORDS       *   FILE 257
//*   PER BLOCK.  THERE WERE MEMORY RESTRICTIONS ONCE, THAT ARE     *   FILE 257
//*   NOW LONG GONE.  BUT WITH THE OLD LINKAGE EDITOR, THEY         *   FILE 257
//*   HAVEN'T REMOVED THE RESTRICTION, AND NOW IT IS "FUNCTIONALLY  *   FILE 257
//*   STABILIZED" FOR ALL PRACTICAL PURPOSES.                       *   FILE 257
//*                                                                 *   FILE 257
//*   I'VE LOOKED AT MY COPIES OF THE OLD LINKAGE EDITOR            *   FILE 257
//*   HEWLKED IN DFSMS, AND BEHOLD, THE OLD RESTRICTION HASN'T      *   FILE 257
//*   BEEN LIFTED OR CURED.  IT IS SO EASY TO DO!  WE HAD A         *   FILE 257
//*   USERMOD ONCE, WHICH I AM BRINGING TO YOU NOW.  I HAVE TWO     *   FILE 257
//*   VERSIONS OF THIS MOD, ONE FOR DFSMS 1.0, AND ANOTHER FOR      *   FILE 257
//*   DFSMS 1.3.  BOTH ARE THE SAME AS EACH OTHER, AND YOU          *   FILE 257
//*   SHOULDN'T HAVE ANY TROUBLE FITTING THIS MOD TO ANY VERSION    *   FILE 257
//*   OF THE OLD LINKAGE EDITOR, YOUNG OR RECENT.  I HAVE ALSO      *   FILE 257
//*   INCLUDED ZAPS FOR ALL VERSIONS OF THE LINKAGE EDITOR WHICH    *   FILE 257
//*   I HAD LYING AROUND AT OUR INSTALLATION, AS WELL AS I COULD    *   FILE 257
//*   DETERMINE.                                                    *   FILE 257
