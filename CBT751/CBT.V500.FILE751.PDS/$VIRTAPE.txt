   I've got dozens of programs.  I assume that you want
some of my IGXMSGEX programs.  See attached.

   I have no intention of creating a software package.

   The sample code is only needed for P/390 and
Flex-ES systems and is not ready for CBT but I guess
that Sam and Sam can look at it.  There are pieces
of one of my tape volume management systems that
someone might find helpful.  There are no install or
customizing instructions for the incomplete sample
programs but member TAPE$DOC gives some hints.
Sam and Sam have seen other trash that I wrote.

   Did anyone ever add P/390 automountCCW to
Hercules?  It would be easy for someone other than
me to do.  I have a couple of copies of almost specs.
01-TMOUNT and a CCW trace from the Flex-ES list.
Neither are mine but I've attach them also.  Until/unless
Hercules supports P/390 automountCCW, DIAG 8 is
not as secure but could be used.  Just update SVC 'W'.

   Warning:  After I put this in production, the operator's
job dropped to a weekly IPL and creating one SDLT per week
for off site data storage.  Don't mess with this code or
operators will have to be trained for other areas.

   Let me know if you need other assembler, perl scripts,
Rexx scripts, JCL sample, etc.

Would you mind sending your "stuff" to CBT tape?
if you dont have time to package it I can set it up on
our Flex test system (if permitted) and package it.
Anyway, please send me whatever you can share.

thanks in advance,

Alex

  Your product sounds interesting but it would be
simplier and more efficient if it used P/390 Flex-ES
auto-mount-CCW to mount tapes.  You can mount 50 to
100 tapes per second.  Read the labels of 3,000 tapes
in less than a minute.  To check my tape libraries,
I can check my already collected SMF data or I can
scan tape labels at a rate of the entire tape pool
of any instance in less than a minute.

  Instead of chmod of tape files, OS/390 and zOS
RETPD= is what tape labels were designed for.

  All OS/390 or zOS tape processing code is in
OS/390 or zOS.  Tape shuffling on UnixWare/Linux
disk not wanted and not needed.

  If you need off-site data storage, I recommend
native NFS instead of Windows style ifs samba.
i.e. Native zOS tools for zOS and native unix type
tools for unix like systems.

  I have a perl script that does an ls for local
and remote directories and uses cp to copy any
tape images that have mis-matched byte counts.
There is no reason to down load a list of tapes
to be copied from zOS or OS/390. i.e. Unix tools
for unix actions and OS/390 tools for OS/390
actions.  I will cron the perl script some day
but started testing with at and never bothered
to switch.

  Your scratch tapes are the same size so am I
to assume that you have compression turned off?
Writing a shorter data file for scratch should
keep it below a disk sector.  I use 20 bytes:
DSNAME   DC    CL44'EMPTY.TAPE '  Data set name for cleared tapes
OUTREC   DC    CL20'TAPEZERO empty tape.'  Data written to tape
The 44 bytes is for open type J

  All are welcome to my IGXMSGEX or other sample
code, just ask.  It is all written specifically
for my system so will have to be modified before
it can be tested.
