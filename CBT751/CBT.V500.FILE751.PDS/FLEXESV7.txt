   Flex-ES V7 AWSTAPE needed options:
allowmountccws                   ( allow P/390 auto mount CCWs )
awscompressalldata         ( compress tape no matter what OS/390 says )
awswritesegmentsize 65535  ( do not break blocks into chunks )
nonewtape         ( causes Flex-ES to not create tapes automagically )
"awsnewtape", "nonewtape", and neither are mutually exclusive.

   Flex-ES V7 AWSTAPE unwanted options:
allowdisconnects ( don't )   ( separates CE/DE if specified )
autoloader n/a                   ( does not help or hurt )
awscompressdata ( don't )  ( would let OS/390 turn IDRC on and off )
awsnewtape               ( allows tapes to be created automagically,
                           will be AWSTAPEs )
maxwritesize ( don't )   ( splits large tapes into multiple tapes
                           while writting )
noidrc ( don't )         ( makes 3480 tape to claim that it
                           does not support IDRC )
nooldtape ( never )      ( always create a new tape.  weird. )

fakecompress [ -? ] | { [ -o ] [ -s size ] inputtape outputtape }
-o says don't write over existing output file.
-s is chunk size from 1-64535 ( probably means 1-65535 )
fakecompress -o -s 65535 C00123.aws ../C00c/C00123.aws

cd /tapeC
mv C00 /tapeA/
mkdir C00
cd /tapeA/C00
for i in C00*;do fakecompress -os 65535 $i /tapeC/C00/$i;done

John McKown:
You must be in the UNIX/Linux side and logged onto a
user who has WRITE access to the files and subdirectory
in which the FakeTape volumes.
Enter the following commands:

"cd /directory/containing/the/faketape/files
for i in *;do fakecompress -o $i $i.compressed.aws;done

This will create a new file in the same directory,
with a prefix equal to the input file name and with
a suffix of ".compressed.aws". Use any suffix you want.
You cannot do an "in place" compress from my reading.

Another possibility is to put the output file in a
second, new, subdirectory with the old file names.
You'd do that something like:

cd /directory/containing/the/faketape/files
for i in *;do fakecompress -o $i
/directory/to/contain/the/compressed/awstapes/$i;done
