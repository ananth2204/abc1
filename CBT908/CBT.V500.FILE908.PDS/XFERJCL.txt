//*
//* This nonexecutable member provides examples of JCL and control cards
//* for transferring files between a mainframe system and PC workstation
//* using the locally written FILEXFER facility which uses ISPF Client
//* Server FILEXFER technology.
//*
//* It is the user's responsibility to ensure that the ISPF workstation
//* agent (WSA) is installed and running on the PC workstation and that
//* it has been configured to automatically accept incoming connection
//* requests from the user's mainframe userID(s) or the mainframe
//* userIDs of other trusted users who are sending files to or receiving
//* files from the PC workstation.
//*
//* The WSA install file for PC workstations running Microsoft Windows
//* is at 'SYS1.ISP.SISPGUI(ISPGUINX)' and can be installed after
//* downloading it in binary to ISPFINST.EXE
//*
//* INPUT: The user supplies up to seven control cards.  Control card
//*        positions one through three contain a two character type code
//*        followed by an equal sign.  Depending on record type, control
//*        positions 4-80 contain data enclosed within apostrophes.
//*
//* IP=IP address of the PC workstation running the WSA
//* PC=Path and file name of the PC workstation file
//* MF=Mainframe file name (must be preallocated if TG='MF')
//* TG=Target of the file transfer: 'PC' or 'MF' (default is 'PC')
//* TY=Transfer type: 'TEXT' or 'BINARY' (default is 'TEXT')
//*
//* Up to three PC= control cards are permitted to accommodate long path
//* and file names. Data on all supplied PC= cards are concatenated
//* together to create a valid path\file name structure.
//*
//* Path and file names may contain embedded spaces.
//*
//* Order matters only for PC= control cards.
//*
//* Control card types TG= and TY= are optional.  TG= is required only
//* when the target is the mainframe.  TY= is required only when the
//* transfer type is BINARY.
//*
//* Mainframe file names must be fully coded.  Relative GDG numbers such
//* as (-3) and (0) are not permitted.  If the target is a member in
//* an existing PDS/PDSE, the member need not already exist.
//*
//* Coding data in columns 73-80 of PC= control cards is not recommended
//* since columns 73-80 could be inadvertently overlaid with sequence
//* numbers.  Not using columns 73-80 allows for a maximum path\file
//* name of 201 characters.  Using columns 73-80 allows for a maximum
//* path\file name of 225 characters.
//*
//* Coding path\file names in the "8.3 short file name" (SFN) format is
//* permissible.
//*   For example,
//*     C:\DOCUMENTS AND SETTINGS\JAMES.HALLEY\MY DOCUMENTS
//*   converts to the following SFN format:
//*     C:\DOCUME~1\JAMES~1.HAL\MYDOCU~1
//*
//* Due to security contraints, drive mapping may be used to reference a
//* path\file on a PC workstation only for uploads.  Drive mapping may
//* be used to reference and create files on network drives for both
//* uploads and downloads.
//*
//* In the following examples, the drive letter, path and file name for
//* PC= are on either a PC workstation running the WSA or a network
//* drive to which the PC workstation and owner has access.
