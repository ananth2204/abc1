Hi Sam,

I hope everything is well with you and yours.

This email is being sent from my new CSGov email address since
CSC has been split into separate companies and I am in one that
is called CSRA - at least that is what it is called this week!

The attached update to FILE908 has important corrections.  When I
finally tested on an LPAR on which the TSO prefix is the same as
the User ID, I found that modules invoked by the DOWNLOAD, DNLD
and EMAIL commands did not pass the temporary file names that
were expected by other modules when the three commands were used
on the command lines of ISPF Edit and View sessions.  The three
commands did, however, work properly when used as line commands
on DSLIST.

I would appreciate if you would apply this update to the CBT and
I will look for it on the UPDATES page.

Thank you again, Sam, for all your good work.

Jim Halley
