Hi Sam,

I did not plan or want to make significant modifications to my
ISPF Client Server Tool Box so soon but a dramatic increase in
the number of people using it and feedback from them led me to
search for ways to make it easier to use.

To address confusion about when to use the edit macro and when to
use the regular command version of some functions (e.g. ENOTEPAD
vs. NOTEPAD), I implemented a technique I call "routing dialogs"
that allow five frequently used commands to appear to function as
both line commands on DSLIST and as edit macros in Edit and View
sessions.  This change is transparent in that users can continue
to use the separate edit macro names and regular command names if
they prefer or if they do not hear about this change.

The above change allowed me to implement commands DOWNLOAD and
UPLOAD which I had wanted to do from the beginnning.  DOWNLOAD
and UPLOAD, being commonly used terms, seem to be easier for
users to remember than DNLD and UPLD which continue to function
as before.

Besides there being a number of new modules, some of the existing
modules had to be renamed and minor logic changes made to them.

The $README member and the zipped instructional Microsoft Word
document in member WORDDOC1 have been revised to reflect these
and other changes.

I was hoping I am finally "done" with this Toolbox but there are
still some improvements that I hope to eventually implement.

My alternate and more permanent email address continues to be

Best regards,
