Hello Sam,

Attached is another update to File # 908 ISPF Client Server Local
Dialogs and Facilities.  The changes are described under "Changes
in Release 4" in the $README member.

Other than including a couple of features that I had
inadvertently left out of the previous release, the main change
in Release 4 is simplification and dramatically improved
performance of the edit macros when invoked from SDSF and ISPF
Edit/View - especially noticeable when downloading reports larger
than 50,000 lines from SDSF.

As before,  I tried to conform to your naming convention, named
the ZIP file contents FILE908.XMI and included the PDS members
that you created previously.

My alternate and more permanent email address continues to be
jimhalley627@gmail.com

Regards,
Jim Halley
