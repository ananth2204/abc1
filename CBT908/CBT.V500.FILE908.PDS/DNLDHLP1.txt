 This Help module is displayed by panels in the ISPF Client Server Toolbox.
  The term "Toolbox" is used to differentiate the non-IBM elements in this
  toolset from standard IBM ISPF Client Server features.

 DOWNLOAD and DNLD - Download a mainframe file or report to a menu selectable
  folder on a PC workstation or network drive.  Use as a line command on DSLIST
  or as a primary command in an Edit or View session.  DOWNLOAD can also be
  invoked by typing TSO DOWNLOAD on an ISPF command line and then manually
  entering the Mainframe Data Set name.  DNLD works the same as DOWNLOAD.

 EMAIL - Attach a mainframe file or report to a new Microsoft Outlook email.
  Use as a line command on DSLIST or as a primary command in an Edit or View
  session.

 UPLOAD and UPLD - Use as a line command on DSLIST to upload a file from a PC
  workstation or network drive to create or replace a mainframe file or member
  of a partitioned data data set.  UPLOAD can also be invoked by typing TSO
  UPLOAD on an ISPF command line and then manually entering the name of the
  Mainframe Data Set/PDS member that will be created or replaced.  If the target
  mainframe data set does not exist, the Data Set Utility panel (ISPF 3.2) is
  displayed to facilitate its allocation.  UPLD works the same as UPLOAD.

 MFEDIT is used as a primary command (i.e. TSO MFEDIT) to edit an existing
  workstation file or to create a new one with mainframe ISPF Edit.  As with the
  standard ISPF Edit Entry Panel, workstation files with records longer than 255
  bytes are wrapped and converted to 255 byte records if the file is saved. Use
  MFEDIT with caution.

 For DOWNLOAD and EMAIL, the default Workstation file name or Attachment name is
  the Mainframe Data Set name followed by .TXT or .BIN based on the value of
  "(T)ext or (B)inary" unless "Append .TXT or .BIN" is set to "N".  Modify the
  Workstation file name or Attachment name as desired.

 For UPLOAD and MFEDIT, the full Workstation file name including extension, if
  any, must be supplied.

 Additional Toolbox dialogs that do not display panels and a standalone batch
 file transfer facility are described later in this help module.

 -------------------------------------------------------------------------------

 The ISPF Workstation Connection

 An active connection between a mainframe ISPF session and an ISPF Workstation
  Agent running under Microsoft Windows is required in order to perform an
  interactive Toolbox function.  Toolbox dialogs automatically display the WSCON
  "Initiate Workstation Connection" screen when performing an interactive
  function if a workstation connection does not already exist.

 A single Workstation Agent can provide concurrent services to multiple ISPF
  sessions and batch jobs running on different mainframe systems.

 A batch job submitted by a Toolbox dialog establishes its own workstation
  connection and does not require the ISPF session from which it was submitted
  to remain active.  A Workstation Agent must remain active until all batch jobs
  using it or waiting to use it have finished. Do not Shut Down or Restart a PC
  Workstation or Log off Windows while a Workstation Agent is in use.

 The TCP/IP address of the target PC workstation must be provided on the ISPF
  WSCON "Initiate Workstation Connection" screen for both Interactive functions
  performed by Toolbox dialogs and for batch jobs submitted from Toolbox
  dialogs.

 The TCP/IP address of a PC workstation is subject to change when its lease
  expires, when a local network is reconfigured or when the PC workstation is
  connected through a VPN.  If it changes frequently, using an IPCONFIG.BAT file
  can make it easier to determine, e.g.

     CD \
     IPCONFIG
     PAUSE

 Putting IPCONFIG.BAT in the Windows Startup folder displays a PC's IP address
 during each Windows logon.

 -------------------------------------------------------------------------------

 Working Directories

  Up to four Working Directory names can be stored on and are shared by Toolbox
  panels except for EMAIL which has its own Working Directory.  For panels
  having fields for four working directories, if one working directory is
  modified, the change is reflected on other Toolbox panels that have fields for
  four working directories.

 Provide embedded spaces when continuing a working directory path to a second
 line.

 PC workstation folders that have been mapped as network drives are READ ONLY
  and cannot be targets of downloads.  Folders on network servers that have been
  mapped as network drives can be used for either download or upload.

 Working Directories - How to determine the path.

  1. Using Microsoft Windows Explorer, right click on the icon of the PC
     Workstation or network drive folder that will be used as a Working
     Directory.
  2. Click Properties.
  3. Copy and Paste the Location into one of the four fields provided for the
     entry and storing of working directory paths.

     Manual entry or multiple Copy and Paste actions may be necessary when
     entering a working directory path longer than 74 characters.

 -------------------------------------------------------------------------------

 Download a PDS/PDSE member - one of several ways:

  Select the PDS/PDSE from DSLIST with the "M" (member list) line command which
  provides an eight character command field where DNLD may be entered.

  Example:

    DSLIST            KCTSHARE.TECH.TTZC28.JCLLIB               Row 00020
    Command ===>                                                  Scroll =

 Upload/replace a PDS/PDSE member - one of several ways:

  Select the PDS/PDSE from DSLIST with the "M" (member list) line command which
  provides an eight character command field where UPLOAD or UPLD may be entered.

  Example:

    DSLIST            KCTSHARE.TECH.TTZC28.JCLLIB               Row 00020
    Command ===>                                                  Scroll =

  This method can also be used to create a new PDS member by typing UPLOAD OR
  UPLD by an existing member and then modifying the member name on the Upload
  Data Set screen when it is displayed.

 TSO Region Size requirements for edit macros used in an Edit or View session:

  Edit macros in this toolbox copy the object being edited or viewed to a
  dynamically allocated temporary file which is then downloaded to a workstation
  file or displayed in Microsoft Notepad.  The maximum size of the temporary
  file is dependent on TSO region size.

  A TSO region size of 32768 (32 megabytes) has been found to be adequate for an
  object with 133 character lines and up to 120,000 rows.  A TSO region size of
  49152 (48 megabytes) has been found to be adequate for an object with 133
  character lines and up to 200,000 records or lines.

  For larger objects, adjust TSO region size upwards in increments of 1024 or
  use the dialog as a line command if possible.

  The larger the report or file, the longer it takes to create the temporary
  file in an Edit or View session.

  Does using DOWNLOAD as a primary command in an Edit or View session really
  require interactive mode?  No.  Batch mode can be used as long as one does not
  return (i.e. PF3) to the Edit or View session from which DOWNLOAD was invoked
  until after the batch download job has started.  Premature return to the Edit
  or View session will cause the batch job to abend due to "FILE NOT FOUND".
  The running batch job prevents the dialog from deleting the temporary file but
  may trigger the display of file contention warning messages which can be
  ignored.

  When using batch mode when DOWNLOAD is invoked from an Edit or View session,
  it is the user's responsibility to manually delete the temporary file after
  the batch job ends.  Temporary file names are in one of the following formats
  depending on mainframe system configuration:
       syspref.userid.EDNLD.SP_time_stamp
       userid.EDNLD.SP_time_stamp

 ISPF Workstation Agent Installation instructions:
  Applies to Microsoft Windows XP and below regardless of z/OS version.
  Applies to Windows 7 and above with z/OS ISPF 2.1 and above.
  Applies to Windows 7 and above with ISPF 1.13 and below with APAR OA39571.

  The ISPF Workstation Agent install file is obtained by downloading
   'SYS1.ISP.SISPGUI(ISPGUINX)' in binary to ISPFINST.EXE in a folder (e.g.
   ISPFCS in My Documents) created on a PC Workstation to hold the Workstation
   Agent components.  Use the file transfer facility of a terminal emulator or
   FTP, if available, to perform the download.  If updating an existing
   functional Workstation Agent with a newer version, ISPF 3.7.1 may be used.

  Run ISPFINST.EXE to install the ISPF Client Server components into the same
   directory to which it was downloaded.  Reply to prompts during the
   installation and ignor the message that directs you to modify a PATH.  Do not
   delete ISPFINST.EXE after the install in case it is necessary to reinstall
   the Workstation Agent.

 -------------------------------------------------------------------------------

 ISPF Workstation Agent Installation instructions:
  Applies to Microsoft Windows 7 and above with z/OS 1.13 but without z/OS
   APAR OA39571.

  The Workstation Agent installation program provided with z/OS 1.13 will not
  run on a Windows 7 workstation unless ISPFINST.EXE has been downloaded from a
  z/OS system on which APAR OA39571 has been implemented.

  In this situation, obtain INSPFINST.EXE from either a Z/OS 1.13 system that
  has had APAR OA39571 implemented or from a z/OS 2.1 system.

  Alternatively, the five required Workstation Agent components from a
  functioning Workstation Agent installation can be copied to a PC
  workstation:  DBCS.TBL DTWSA.DLL MSG.TBL SBCS.TBL WSA.EXE

  Contact mainframe support staff if you require assistance.

 -------------------------------------------------------------------------------

 Workstation Agent Configuration for a TCP/IP connection. (APPC will not be
  covered here.)

  Add a shortcut for WSA.EXE to the Windows Startup folder so that the
   Workstation Agent is always available when needed - important since
   Batch client server functions abend if the target Workstation Agent is not
   active.  A WSA shortcut in the Windows Startup folder can also be used to
   restart the WSA - necessary after modifying a WSA setting.

  A WSA shortcut on the Windows Desktop can also be useful.  The WSA is shown
   in Windows "All Programs" only if a shortcut is added to the Windows Startup
   folder.

  The Workstation Agent can be used as installed but performing a few simple
   configuration steps can reduce effort and eliminate errors.  It is
   particularly advantageous to allow mainframe ISPF sessions and batch jobs to
   automatically connect to a workstation agent rather than to manually respond
   to each connection request and cause batch jobs to wait and ISPF sessions to
   "clock".

  Step by step:

  Select Options ... Information from the Workstation Agent window.
   Verify that the TCP Status is:

       "TCP initialized"
             0  Sesssions(s) are active.

       The display of a message other than the above may indicate a nonstandard
        or damaged Microsoft Windows installation - an unusual occurance.
       To address this issue, search the PC workstation C: drive for the
        location of "WINSOCK" and record the path to it - typically
        C:\WINDOWS\system32 or C:\WINDOWS\sysWOW64
       Select Options ... Set Winsock Path...
        Enter the path to WINSOCK in the "Windows socket library path" field.
        Click the OK button.
       Close and restart the Workstation Agent.
       Select Options ... Information and recheck the TCP Status.
       If "TCP initialized" is still not displayed, contact PC Support and
        report a Windows socket issue.


  Select Options from the Workstation Agent window.
   Enable TCP/IP if it is disabled.
   Disable APPC if it is enabled.

  Select Options ... Set Font.
   Select font "Terminal", Font style "Regular" and Size "9".
   Click the OK button.

   Note:  The selected font is used when running ISPF in GUI mode in which each
    ISPF session is displayed in a separate PC window instead of in the terminal
    emulator.  If you choose to use GUI mode, you may wish to later alter the
    font based on how the GUI windows display on your particular workstation
    screen.

  Select Options ... System Register.
   Click the Add buttom in the "Systems" (upper left) portion of the window.
   Enter the mainframe System name and its TCP/IP address in the Add System
   popup window.

    Any word may be used to represent a mainframe system name.

    Enter the system IP address in "dotted decimal" format, e.g. 999.999.999.99
    If unknown, obtain the system IP address from your mainframe support staff.

    Another method of determining a system IP address is to refrain from
    configuring the System Register for a mainframe system and to note the IP
    address displayed in the Connection request window when a connection is
    requested from an ISPF session.

    Click the "Auto connect list" selection.
    Click the Add button for User IDs and enter your mainframe User ID.
    Click the OK button.

  Close and restart the WSA in order for the changes to take effect.

 -------------------------------------------------------------------------------

 ISPF session configuration

  Obtain and record the TCP/IP address of your PC workstation.

     The TCP/IP Address of a PC workstation can be determined by typing IPCONFIG
     at the Microsoft Windows command window prompt, e.g.
         Start... Run... cmd... IPCONFIG

     In a normal in-office environmnet, use the TCP/IP address displayed for
     Ethernet adapter Local Area Connection.

     When connected via a VPN (Virtual Private Network), use the TCP/IP address
     displayed for Ethernet adapter Network Connect Adapter.  Note:  If
     connecting through a router, it may be necessary to configure it to allow
     incoming connection requests to pass through it.

  With the Workstation Agent running, type command WSCON on any ISPF command
   line.

   On the Initiate Workstation Connection popup window (example below),

     Select:  2  "Without GUI display" under Workstation Connection
     Select:  1  "TCP/IP" under GUI Network Protocol
     Enter the TCP/IP address of your PC workstation under "TCP/IP Address"
      where 000.000.00.000 is shown below.

     Leave Host Codepage and Host Character Set blank for now.
     Select:  1  "Standard (STD)" under GUI Window Frame
     Select:  1  "Dialog (DLG)" under Default Window Background Color

 Workstation Tool Integration Configuration - Optional

  Customizing the Workstation Tool Integration Configuration, per the following
  instructions, is necessary only if using IBM standard ISPF Client Server
  features and is not required by the ISPF Client Server Toolbox.

  While the mainframe ISPF session is connected to a Workstation Agent, navigate
   to either the ISPF Browse or Edit panel.

  From the CUA action bar, choose
      Workstation ... 1. Workstation Tool Integration

  Select "View" and then "Edit" with the "E" line command.  The below image

  Note:  The path of My Documents can be determined by mouse clicking the
         Windows "Start" button, right clicking "My Documents", and selecting
         "Properties".  Use the mouse to highlight the Target so that it can be
         copied and pasted into the Working directory field on the Modify Tool
         Configuration panel.

 -------------------------------------------------------------------------------

  Contact mainframe support staff if a mainframe System TCP/IP address appears
  to have changed and you can not determine or verify the TCP/IP address.

  The mainframe system TCP/IP address can sometimes be determined by pinging the
  mainframe host name shown in the job logs of the DB2, FTP and TCP/IP started
  tasks and in the Connection Setup of terminal emulators that are not connected
  through a proxy (e.g.  MIAP).

    The format of the PING command in ISPF is:  TSO PING host_name
