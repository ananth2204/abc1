                Differences between ALGOL68C and ALGOL 68


Restrictions

.   No parallel clauses.

.   No flexible names.

.   No formatted transput.

.   No vacuums.

.   An indicant may not be used as both an operator and a
    mode-indication.

.   Round brackets are not available in row-declarers.
    (But see 'row-symbol' below.)

.   Colon-symbol must not be present in virtual rowers.

.   Both bounds must be specified in an actual rower.

.   := and =: are not available in operators.
    (But see 'assign-formulas' below.)

.   Widening of BITS and BYTES is not provided.


Extensions

.   Labels in enquiry-clauses.

.   UPTO and DOWNTO in loop-clauses.

.   Until-part in loop-clauses.

.   Operator priorities.

.   Row-symbol in row-declarers.
    (e.g. ROW()AMODE as an alternative to âäAMODE.)

.   Monadic-formula is a secondary.

.   Displacements (yielding the previous value).

.   Assign-formulas (op:= and op:=:= are automatically available for all
    op).

.   Predicates (ANDF and ORF have defined sequence of elaboration).

.   Handles.

.   Escaped-characters in string-denotations (e.g. *" yields ").

.   Use of square brackets in calls.

.   Thef-symbol in conditional-clauses.
    (e.g. IF a THEF b THEN c ELSE d FI)

.   :¬=: as a representation of the is-not-symbol.
