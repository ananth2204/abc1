Sam,

I'm attaching to this email an xmit archive of a little ICSF KGUP
protection exit that I wrote to save me from shooting myself in
the foot if I accentally delete a production data decryption key.

From the $NOTES member in the PDS.

ICSF PROVIDES A BATCH INTERFACE (KGUP) THAT ALLOWS AN AUTHORIZED ICSF
ADMINISTRATOR TO ADD/DELETE/UPDATE KEYS IN THE CKDS DATABASE.

WHILE YOUR SECURITY PRODUCT CAN PROTECT THE USAGE OF THESE KEYS DURING
THEIR INTENDED USAGE, THERE IS NO PROTECTION AGAINST ACCIDENTAL OR
MALICIOUS ACTIONS ON THE KEYS THEMSELVES.

THE SUPPLIED KGUPEXIT ICSF EXIT ENHANCES ICSF SECURITY BY CHECKING
TO SEE IF THE ICSF ADMINISTRATOR HAS UPDATE ACCESS TO THE KEY BEING
ACTED UPON, PRIOR TO ALLOWING THE UTILITY PROGRAM TO PERFORM THE
REQUESTED FUNCTION.
