//***FILE 863 is from Jim Callihan and contains an IKJEFF10 TSO     *   FILE 863
//*           SUBMIT exit that originally came from PRC's CBT tape  *   FILE 863
//*           File 369.  It stopped working from z/OS 1.12 to 1.13  *   FILE 863
//*           because of a change in control blocks, and Jim found  *   FILE 863
//*           a different way to obtain the information, which,     *   FILE 863
//*           by the way, also works on old systems back to OS/390  *   FILE 863
//*           1.3 (the first Y2K compliant MVS release).  So (I     *   FILE 863
//*           think) you can use this version of the exit on older  *   FILE 863
//*           systems too.                                          *   FILE 863
//*                                                                 *   FILE 863
//*           The exit inserts a comment line in the JCL source,    *   FILE 863
//*           telling you where the JCL in the job came from.       *   FILE 863
