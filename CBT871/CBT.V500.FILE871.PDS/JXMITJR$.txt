JXMITJR installation instructions.
------- ------------ ------------

  Running the JXMIT program on the PC.

  This will allow you to view or save XMIT-format files on the PC.

  ----------------------------------------------------------------

1.  The jxmit.jar file which must be produced on the PC,
    is an unzip of this file.  The unzip should be 28817
    bytes in size, and it should be called jxmit.jar

2.  To produce jxmit.jar, download the JXMITJR member of
    this pds in BINARY to a PC, and unzip it.  The unzipped
    object, called jxmit.jar, should be 28817 bytes in size.

3.  Copy the text of the JXMITCMD member, into the same
    directory as jxmit.jar on the PC.  Call this member
    jxmit.cmd .  The text on the PC, should be in ASCII.

4.  In a DOS shell, change (cd\ command) to the directory
    that both these members are in.  jxmit.jar and jxmit.cmd
    should be in the same directory.

    If you don't want to use a DOS shell, just point to this
    directory from Windows Explorer (Computer), and click on the
    icon that represents jxmit.cmd.  Skip step 5.

5.  From that directory, issue the command:   jxmit

6.  The application should fire up in Windows.

7.  I made a new shortcut in Windows as follows:  (name JXMIT)

    A.  subdirectory c:\jxmit contains two items:

        jxmit.jar and jxmit.cmd

    B.  jxmit.cmd contains the command:

        start javaw -cp jxmit.jar de.roland.jxmit.JXmitGui

    C.  The new shortcut has properties as follows:

        start in:   c:\jxmit

        target  :   c:\jxmit\jxmit.cmd

        and it runs in a normal window.
