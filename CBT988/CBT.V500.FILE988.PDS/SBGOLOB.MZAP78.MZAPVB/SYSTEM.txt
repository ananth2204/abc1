00002000II. SYSTEM and INPUT/OUTPUT REQUIREMENTS
00004000.sp 1
00006000.in 5
00008000MZAP requires that the control program be OS/MVT or OS/65MP;
00010000OS/VS2 Release 1.6 support is planned in the near future;
00012000and provision has been made for easily adding MFT or VS1 support
00014000with only minor modifications.
00016000No optional OS facilities need be generated,
00018000other than normal device support (for the 2260,
00020000this must be explicitly requested via the GRAPHICS macro;
00022000for the 3270, this must be requested via the BTAM option
00024000of the DATAMGT macro; for all sequential and DA devices
00026000this support is automatic).
00028000In particular, MZAP does not use SVC 54 to get into key 0,
00030000and hence ISAM is not required.
00032000When VS support is available,
00034000MZAP will be required to run only from an authorized library.
00036000.sp 1
00038000MZAP is intended to obtain input from multiple sources:
00040000a data set called SYSIN,
00042000a TSO terminal,
00044000a local crt, or an operator's console.
00046000If MZAP is invoked from a TSO terminal,
00048000input can be supplied only form SYSIN or the terminal;
00050000otherwise a DD statement may be supplied allocating a
00052000960 byte (12*80) local 2260 with line addressing and
00054000non-destructive cursor
00056000or a 1920 byte (24*80) EBCDIC local 3270,
00058000which may be used for both input and output.
00060000Input, output, and attention from an operators
00062000console are performed via REPLY,
00064000WTO/WTOR, and MODIFY;
00066000they are normally inactive if a CRT is assigned,
00068000but an uncorrectable I/O error on the CRT will
00070000force transfer of these functions (the operator may
00072000perform a MODIFY even when the CRT is operational).
00074000.sp 1
00076000Input is normally from a sequential data set,
00078000SYSIN. If SYSIN is not defined or is a DD DUMMY,
00080000"console input mode" is set.
00082000This mode is also set by a CONSOLE statement read
00084000from SYSIN or by a MODIFY or attention with the text CONSOLE.
00086000Input is always translated to upper case.
00088000Console mode is terminated, and control reverted to SYSIN,
00090000by an END statement;
00092000this is permitted only when SYSIN is assigned.
00094000.sp 1
00096000Output is normally to SYSPRINT.
00098000If a 2260 or 3270 is assigned,
00100000all output except page headings will be displayed on the CRT;
00102000if in console input mode with no CRT assigned,
00104000this output will be displayed via WTO/TPUT.
00106000.sp 1
00108000When a TSO terminal or a CRT is used,
00110000it is in one of two states: normal and attention.
00112000In normal state, input is solicited in a device-dependent fashion:
00114000.in 10
00116000.sp 1
00118000.hi 12
001200002260 local:
00122000Blanking the entry line and displaying an SMI;
00124000the user keys in a command and depresses SHIFT and ENTER simultaneously.
00126000.sp 1
001280003270 local:
00130000writing a statement number, Blanking an entry line,
00132000and positioning the cursor;
00134000the user enters a command and depresses ENTER.
00136000.sp 1
001380002260 TSO: ¬
00140000Writing a statement number followed by an SMI;
00142000the user enters a command and SHIFT/ENTER.
00144000.sp 1
001460003270 TSO: ¬
00148000writing a statement number and positioning the cursor;
00150000the user enters a command and ENTER.
00152000.sp 1
00154000TSO: ¬¬¬¬¬¬¬
00156000Writing a statement number;
00158000the user enters a command and depresses RETURN, EOB, etc.,
00160000according to the type of terminal.
00162000.sp 2
00164000.hi 0
00166000.in 5
00168000Attention state is entered in a device-dependent fashion:
00170000.in 10
00172000.hi 12
00174000.sp 1
00176000Local 2260:
00178000SHIFT/ENTER within 1.5 seconds after
00180000line 11(bottom line) is updated;
00182000.sp 1
00184000Local 3270:
00186000ENTER or PA1 any time the keyboard is
00188000unlocked;
00190000.sp 1
00192000TSO: ¬¬¬¬¬¬¬
00194000the technique depends on type of terminal,
00196000TSO/TCAM generation,
00198000and the users last TERM command - it may be BREAK or
00200000may be a simulated attention.
00202000Attention state is also entered automatically when in HOLD mode
00204000(see below).
00206000.sp 1
00208000.hi 0
00210000.in 5
00212000When in attention state,
00214000the user will be prompted to key in an attention message by
00216000blanking an entry line and displaying "EH ? " followed by an SMI (>|)
00218000- a greater than sign (>) will be used on other than a 2260.
00220000The prompt will be repeated after each attention message,
00222000allowing the user to key in as many messages as he wishes;
00224000attention state will be reset when he enters a null line
00226000(SHIFT/ENTER, SHIFT, CR, etc. with no preceeding text).
00228000.sp 2
00230000.hi 0
00232000.in 5
00234000.sp 2
00236000Output to the CRT/terminal may be done in two modes:
00238000AUTO and HOLD;
00240000output may be at any of four speeds:
00242000SLOW, HALFAST, FAST, or PAGE.
00244000In AUTO mode, output occurs continously until input is
00246000required or the user enters attention state;
00248000in HOLD mode attention state is entered after each write
00250000and the user must enter a null line to continue.
00252000.sp 2
00254000Output to a CRT will always be in full screen mode;
00256000the oldest line on the screen will be indicated by a logical or
00258000(|).
00260000The write will take place every time one, two, four, or twelve lines
00262000(1,4,8, or 24 for 3270) have been written,
00264000depending on the speed option.
00266000In PAGE mode, one line (two if a dump is in progress)
00268000will be reserved on the screen,
00270000resulting in a net display of 11 (10 if a dump) lines per 2260 screen
00272000and 23 (22 if a dump) per 3270 screen.
00274000Regardless of the speed,
00276000the current contents of the buffer will be written prior to
00278000soliciting input or additional attention messages.
00280000.sp 2
00282000When a CRT is not assigned,
00284000operator input in batch (non-TSO) will be solicited by a WTOR;
00286000attention messages must be entered by giving the command
00288000"MODIFY id,msg" where id is the jobname or START id and
00290000msg is the text of the attention message.
00292000See section V for a description of START requirements.

00386000A write will occur for every 10 or 11 output lines
00388000(3270: 22 or 23 output lines).
