00026000¬tMZAP is intended to be individually assembled for each
00028000combination of operating system, system level, and CPU;
00030000it will not function properly if run on the wrong system or CPU.
00032000Any installation with multiple CPUs must order MZAP separately
00034000for each CPU; any violation of this is construed as theft and
00036000appropriate action will be taken.
00038000.sp 1
00040000¬tMZAP is intended to protect itself against theft,
00042000by whatever means are considered appropriate.
00044000Use at an unauthorized installation may crash the system,
00046000destroy online disks,
00048000or anything else which may strike my fancy:
00050000furthermore, if such theft is discovered, legal action may be taken,
00052000over and above whatever steps occur automatically.
00054000.sp 1
00056000¬tMZAP source consists of a set of macros,
00058000a set of subroutines,
00060000and a main module.
00062000All of these have names beginning with MZ;
00064000those subroutines which are link-edited together
00066000with the main module have names beginning with MZAP.
00068000.sp 1
00070000¬tTo generate a copy of MZAP, certain important variables must
00072000be ascertained.
00074000They are as follows:

00092000Central Processing Unit.
00094000While the number is normally found on the front of the system console,
00096000in certain models (such as 168) the console may be considered to be
00098000a separate unit, and, as such, assigned a separate number;
00100000it is safest to obtain the number from the CE, or in the case of 370s,
00102000by performing a STIDP instruction while in supervisor mode.

00148000VERSION 3.0 or 3.1, this parameter should be specified as
00150000the three decimal digit SVC number assigned to HASP.
00152000HASP I is totally unsupported, support is planned for HASP II versions
001540004 and JES2(HASP II Version 5).
00156000If you think you are using HASP 3, 4, or 5,
00158000take another look at the book; or see an optometrist:
00160000from 1968 to 1974, the only HASP releases have been HASP 2 (would you
00162000believe an MFT/1 HASP 1 site in beautiful downtown Burbank?) -
00164000any other number you may have heard is due to illiteracy.
00166000This parameter is ignored for versions 4 and 5.

00182000¬tIn addition to the MZAP macros,
00184000OS macros from SYS1.MACLIB, SYS1.MODGEN, and SYS1.PVTMACS are used.
00186000If the system was generated without TSO,
00188000certain of the macros will be missing from SYS1.MACLIB
00190000and may be found in SYS1.TSOMAC and SYS1.TCAMMAC.
00192000For VS, some of the name have changes (for instance,
00194000SYS1.MODGEN is now SYS1.AMODGEN),
00196000but it should be clear from a listing of the VTOC what
00198000the proper names are.
00200000.sp 1
00202000¬tThese OS macros come from two sources,
00204000the DLIB disks and the optional source material.
00206000While those macros not in SYS1.MACLIB will be supplied
00208000as part of MZAP,
00210000it is recommended that the installation replace them
00212000with the macros at the proper release level.
00214000.sp 2
00216000¬tTo install MZAP, all modules must be reassembled

00424000this is interpreted as being due to an unauthorized use of
00426000a stolen copy of MZAP and appropriate measures are taken;
00428000a system crash is the least that could result.
