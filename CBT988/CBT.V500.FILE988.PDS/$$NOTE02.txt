File # 988 OS/360 Storage Zap - original program from S. Metz * NEW

"MOREZAP (MZAP) is a replacement for COREZAP0 that can locate
csects by name in the jobpack, linkpack and nucleus. It can be
assembled for OS/360 or for OS/VS2 R1 (SVS); it may require
changes for OS/VS1. It can locate various system control blocks
and can display storage either as raw hex+EBCDIC or with opcode
deciphering for, e.g., S/360, S/370 and compatibility features.
There is a COPY file that must be tailored prior to assembly.
MZAP process all VER statements prior to any ZAP statements,
relying on SSM for serialization.

MZAP can also follow pointer chains.

The code would need significant changes to support MVS; feel free
to contact Shmuel (Seymour J.) Metz <smetz3@gmu.edu> if you wish
guidance."
