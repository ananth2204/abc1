On 4/16/2019 1:55 PM, Seymour J Metz wrote some thoughts as to
             how to modernize this program.

  Off the top of my head:

  The documentation should be usable with Waterloo Script.

  Remove the code for detecting whether use is authorized. Keep
that version for OS/360, OS/VS1 and SVS.

  For MVS, fork the code and remove the irrelevant conditional
assembly stuff. Add code to deal with:

  The lookup of Nucleus csects will need changes.

  MVS treats disabled page faults as errors, so the SSM locking
mechanism used for SVS will need to be replaced

  The 3270 support will probably need to be tweaked.

  The console support may need to be tweaked.

  The 2260 support can go.

  MVS support will require use of CSA and SRB code
and support of later systems should include SAF
rather than my ad hoc authentication.

  For more current systems, support for looking up csects in
program objects would be nice. Also, the console support could
take advantage of new facilities.
