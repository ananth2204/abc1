//*           This is the very first Excel spreadsheet (to my       *   FILE 855
//*           knowledge) that we have on the CBT Tape, and to       *   FILE 855
//*           use it, you do the following:                         *   FILE 855
//*                                                                 *   FILE 855
//*           Download member URIDCV10 in BINARY to a PC.           *   FILE 855
//*           Rename the file with a suffix of .xls                 *   FILE 855
//*             so it will be called, for example:                  *   FILE 855
//*                                                                 *   FILE 855

//*           At his point, open the file with Microsoft Excel      *   FILE 855
//*           or the equivalent, and it should work.                *   FILE 855
//*                                                                 *   FILE 855
