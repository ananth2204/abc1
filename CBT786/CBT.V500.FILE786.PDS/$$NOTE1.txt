Hello, Sams,

When someone pointed out to me on IBM-MAIN that abstracts
were available in File 1 of the CBT tapes, I looked and
saw that there was one inconveniently large file.  Here's
a script that breaks File 1 into individual HTML abstracts.

It works on z/OS 1.7, Solaris 10, and OS X 10.4.  You might
use it to make broken-out abstracts available on cbttape.org,
or make it available for download for users to RYO.

I don't know how to submit z/OS Unix files to cbttape.org
-- TSO TRANSMIT doesn't quite work.  Perhaps it's better
sent to the Tools and Toys page.

Suggestions for revision are welcome.

Thanks,
gil
