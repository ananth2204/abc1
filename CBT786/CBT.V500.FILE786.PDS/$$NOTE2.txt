Sam,

Your manifest interest has paradoxically impelled
me to delay; now I'd like to supply documentation,
and perhaps add my Rexx CBTTAPE downloader as a
hammer-and-file to fit.  And it's a busy few days --
we're moving offices tomorrow.

Cbtabs is a POSIX shell script, mostly relying on an
instream awk program.  Awk is fairly similar to Rexx in
its capabilities, enough that when I use either I wish
for parts of the other.  I can repackage cbtabs as a
pax archive in a FB-80 PDS member with a README
instructions for extraction and use.
