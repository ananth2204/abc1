DSREF from Steve Myers (mvsprog@yahoo.com)

DSREF produces three reports:

 - Data set to userid

   data set name
    user user ... user

 - User to data set

   user
    data set  data set ... data set

 - Optional list of jobs in the data

Member  Purpose
DSREF    The main program
QSORTS   An in storage sort program loosely modeled on the C standard
         library qsort function
MINIFMT  A message format program
INSTALL  JCL to assemble and link DSREF and its dependent modules

Installation -
 - Method 1 - Use the TSO RECEIVE command to transform the LOADMOD
              member in this data set to build a load module form
              of the DSREF program.

              RECEIVE INDATASET(this-data-set(LOADMOD))

 - Method 2 - Customize the INSTALL member in this data set to
              assemble and link the DSREF program and its 2 dependent
              modules to build a load module form of the DSREF
              program.

Run time JCL -

 //        EXEC PGM=DSREF,PARM='option,option,...'
 //SYSPRINT DD  SYSOUT=*
 //SMF      DD  -- SMF data --

 The SMF data must contain SMF type 14, 15 and 30 records.  The SMF 30
 records link a userid (from SMF30RUD) to job information (from the
 SMF 14 and 15 records).

 The options are documented in the DSREF module.

A few notes about the program

At one time the program listed the users it found as a separate report.
The code is still there, but it has effectively been disabled; it was
superflous after the data sets accessed by a user was added.  The
USERLIST and NOUSERLIST options are still in the option table, but
as comments.

DSREF and MINIFMT are effectively in the public domain.  However, they

Any additions should be declared separately.  The QSORTS module is
not copyrighted because it is based on code from the copyrighted
"The C Programming Language."  Appropriate attribution is in the
