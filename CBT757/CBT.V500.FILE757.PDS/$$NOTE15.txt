Sam:

I have attached file File757_072112.zip as a #17 fix-pack for
reported problems and user requests.

The zip file will contain a file named FILE757.XMI. This Fix
Pack 17 replaces all components previously at V1R1M16 with new
level V1R1M17.

Member $$FIXPAC in FILE757 has the detail description of all
changes. A summary of the changes is as follows:


Change Summary: Fix Pack 17

(1)-Fixed bug when user program specified the LOG=OFF parm in a
    LPGMNTRY statement.

(2)-Fixed bug in Register Summary Report which was indicating an
    invalid 64-bit address as belonging to an above-the-bar memory
    object in user's address space.

(3)-Added new Assembler source program LGMHLB64 to support the
    buffering of log records to memory objects above-the-bar.

(4)-Added support for 20-bit displacement to allow for a 1 megabyte
    addressable range (-512K to +512K) to labels specified by user
    in a #LGPOINT. Removes previous 4K addressable range limit.

(5)-Added new Adobe Acrobat PDF version of documentation as file
    name $$DOCPDF.

(6)-Updated documentation in the $$DOC text file, the $$DOCWRD
    Microsoft Word file, and the $$DOCPDF Adobe Acrobat PDF file.


If you could refresh CBT File 757 with this new Fix Pack 17, it
would be greatly appreciated. If you have any questions, please
do not hesitate to ask.


Best regards,
Ken Fitzgerald
