Sam:

I have attached file 'File757_01052011.zip' as a #13 fix-pack
for reported problems and user requests.

The zip file will contain a file named FILE757.XMI. This Fix
Pack 13 replaces all components previously at V1R1M12 with new
level V1R1M13.

Member $$FIXPAC in FILE757 has the detail description of
changes. A summary of the changes is as follows:

Change Summary: Fix Pack 13

(1)-Fixed bug in diagnostic abend report where instruction
    registers were not being correctly identified in the
    Register Summary report section.

(2)-Fixed bug in diagnostic abend report where an incorrect
    designated register number would be flagged when identifying
    the R3 register in a RRF3/RRF-a-b format instruction.

(3)-Fixed bug when user specified the WATCH= parm in a #LGPOINT
    entry where insufficient uniform distribution of hash tokens
    would result in some collisions.

(4)-Fixed bug in diagnostic abend report processing. Retry would
    be attempted when contents of SDWAGRSV, SDWAG64, SDWAARER,
    and SDWAEC1 were not available in the SDWA, or if the Logger
    Services ESTAE was not 1st to get control.

(5)-Added additional logic in diagnostic abend report processing
    to detect when an instruction is improperly aligned, wrong
    length, or in a data area with a starting byte that matches
    a valid op code but is not an instruction.

(6)-Added support for new CPU instructions introduced by the IBM
    zEnterprise 196 series of processors.

(7)-Added support for the display of the 128-bit z/Architecture
    format Program Status Word (PSW) in diagnostic report.

(8)-Added support for the display of the CPU state, PSW key, and
    addressing mode for program entry and program exit in Logger
    report.

(9)-Added support for the display of the CPU state, PSW key,
    Addressing Mode, Condition Code, and Address Space mode in
    abend report.

(10)Added support for the display in the abend report of the
    Load Module name and the offset within the module where the
    last successful 'branch from' instruction occurred.

(11)Added the display of subpool storage number information to
    the private area subpools allocated section in the
    diagnostic abend report.

(12)Made changes to reduce the footprint for each log point, and
    reduce the LCA prefix area for each user program RSECT.

(13)Tested on z/OS V1R12.

(14)Updated $$DOC text file and $$DOCWRD Word file.


It would be greatly appreciated if you could refresh CBT File 757
with this new #13 fix pack. If you have any questions, please do
not hesitate to ask.


Best regards,
