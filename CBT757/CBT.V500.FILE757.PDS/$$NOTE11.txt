Sam:

I have attached file File757_042211.zip as a #14 fix-pack for
reported problems and user requests.

The zip file will contain a file named FILE757.XMI. This Fix
Pack 14 replaces all components previously at V1R1M13 with new
level V1R1M14.

Member $$FIXPAC in FILE757 has the detail description of all
changes. A summary of the changes is as follows:

Change Summary: Fix Pack 14

(1)-Fixed bug in diagnostic abend report where the incorrect
    address space mode and condition code were displayed.

(2)-For the diagnostic abend report added support to disassemble
    the hex machine code instruction from a storage area into an
    assembler language source statement.

(3)-For the diagnostic abend report, updated the Logger Services
    zArchitecture Machine Code Instruction Table to conform with
    new changes in "z/Achitecture Principles of Operations, Ninth
    Edition".

(4)-Added new JCL member ASMALLOC as a batch job to allocate the
    the installation data sets for LOGGRASM.

(5)-Added new Format-7 save area mapping, and added equates for
    access registers in LGCPLOGR copybook.

(6)-Added equates to designate access registers when preserving and
    restoring the access registers on entry and exit to Logger
    Service calls.

(7)-Updated $$DOC text file and $$DOCWRD Word file.


It would be greatly appreciated if you could refresh CBT File 757
with this new #14 fix pack. If you have any questions, please do
not hesitate to ask.


Best regards,
Ken Fitzgerald
