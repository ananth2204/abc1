Sam:

I have attached file File757_012712.zip as a #16 fix-pack for
reported problems and user requests.

The zip file will contain a file named FILE757.XMI. This Fix
Pack 16 replaces all components previously at V1R1M15 with new
level V1R1M16.

Member $$FIXPAC in FILE757 has the detail description of all
changes. A summary of the changes is as follows:


Change Summary: Fix Pack 16

(1)-Fixed Logpoint design to reduce the footprint in a user's
    program through use of LOCTR for #LGPOINT Data Areas.

(2)-For the diagnostic abend report, updated the Logger Services
    abend retry program to process the Breaking Event Address and
    produce a new report section named 'Breaking Event Before
    Abend'.

(3)-For the diagnostic abend report, updated the Logger Services
    abend retry program to display additional information on the
    attributes of an abending SVC in the section named 'Last
    Interrupt Event in Program Before Abend'

(4)-Updated $$DOC text file and $$DOCWRD Word file.


As you have done so well in the past, if you could refresh CBT
File 757 with this new #16 fix pack, I would be most thankful.
Please do not hesitate to ask if you have any questions.


Best regards,
Ken Fitzgerald
