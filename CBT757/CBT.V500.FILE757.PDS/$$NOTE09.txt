Sam:

I have attached file File757_030510.zip as a #12 fix-pack
for reported problems and user requests.

The zip file will contain a file named FILE757.XMI. This Fix
Pack 12 replaces all components at V1R1M11 with V1R1M12.
Member $$FIXPAC in FILE757 has the detail description of
changes. A summary of the changes is as follows:

Change Summary: Fix Pack 12:

(1) Fixed bug in date process where the Gregorian date being
    displayed was off by one day beginning on March 1 and after
    on only odd-numbered non-leap year decades (e.g, 1990, 2010).

(2)-Fixed bug in the diagnostic abend report where the target
    instruction of an Execute was not being displayed when the B2
    register of the Execute instruction =>8.

(3)-Fixed bug in the diagnostic abend report where the register
    address in register summary report had an incorrect storage
    type displayed for alloc/free-space areas.

(4)-Changed the sample program USERPGM2 to add intentional abend
    to show example of diagnostic abend report.

(5)-Increased the default size of initial stacked LCA from 8K
    to 32K.

(6)-Updated $$DOC text file and $$DOCWRD Word file.

It would be greatly appreciated if you could refresh CBT File 757
with this new #12 fix pack. If you have any questions, please do
not hesitate to ask.

Best regards,
Ken Fitzgerald
