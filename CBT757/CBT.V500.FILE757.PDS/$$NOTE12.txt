Sam:

I have attached file File757_093011.zip as a #15 fix-pack for
reported problems and user requests.

This Fix Pack 15 replaces all components previously at V1R1M14
with new level V1R1M15.

Member $$FIXPAC in FILE757 has the detail description of all
changes. A summary of the changes is as follows:


Change Summary: Fix Pack 15

(1)-Fixed bug in calls made to DFSMS services to conform to new
DFSMS macro changes introduced in z/OS V1R13 which included new
stricter enforcement of 64-bit and AR rules.

(2)-Fixed bug in diagnostic abend report where Register Summary
section of report was not indicating when registers flagged were
for the target instruction of an Execute Instruction.

(3)Fixed bug where S0C4-11 abends may occur in the LGMHESTA abend
recovery program when a user program which abended was in 64-bit
addressing mode and executing on less than z/OS V1R11.

(4)-For the diagnostic abend report, added new RSECT DIVC0000 in
the Logger Services abend retry program to disassemble from a
storage area the hex machine code instructions in the vicinity of
an abending instruction.

(5)-For the diagnostic abend report, added new RSECT DRBT0000 in
the Logger Services abend retry program to create a new report
section to show additional diagnostic information when an abend
in an SVC.

(6)-For the diagnostic abend report, added support to display
storage subpool information for CSA, SQA, and LSQA when
processing the Register Summary Report.

(7)-For the diagnostic abend report, the 'Abend Summary' section
was reformatted from a horizontal expansion to a vertical expansion
with more detailed descriptions for various fields, and moved
closer to the top of the report.

(8)-Updated $$DOC text file and $$DOCWRD Word file.


It would be greatly appreciated if you could refresh CBT File 757
with this new #15 fix pack. If you have any questions, please do
not hesitate to ask.


Best regards,
Ken Fitzgerald
