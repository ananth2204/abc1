Sam:

I have attached file FILE757_052409.zip as a #10 fix-pack for
reported problems and user requests.

The zip file will contain a file named FILE757.XMI. This Fix
Pack replaces all components at V1R1M09 with V1R1M10.

Member $$FIXPAC in FILE757 has the detail description of
changes. A summary of the changes is as follows:

Change Summary: Fix Pack 10

(1)-Fixed bug in build of search argument used for zArch
    machine instruction table.

(2)Fixed S0C4 abend in load module search routine.

(3)Added support for display of a new register analysis summary
   section in diagnostic abend report.

(4)-Updated $$DOC text file and $$DOCWRD Word file.

If you could refresh CBT File 757 with this new fix pack, it
would be greatly appreciated. If you have any questions, please
do not hesitate to ask.

Best regards,
Ken Fitzgerald
