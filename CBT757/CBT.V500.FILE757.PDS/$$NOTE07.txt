Sam:
I have attached file FILE757_102309.zip as a #11 fix-pack for
reported problems and user requests.

The zip file will contain a file named FILE757.XMI. This Fix Pack
11 replaces all components at V1R1M10 with V1R1M11.  Member
$$FIXPAC in FILE757 has the detail description of changes. A
summary of the changes is as follows:

Change Summary: Fix Pack 11

(1)-LOGGRASM tested on z/OS V1R11.

(2)-Fixed S0C4-11 abends in LGMHESTA program when z/OS V1R7.

(3)-Fixed bug in register summary report where some register
    addresses displayed with an incorrect load module name.

(4)-Fixed bug in diagnostic abend report where registers were
    not being correctly indentified on Execute Instruction.

(5)-Fixed bug in Logger Services report where an odd numbered
    offset value displayed on Amode64 entry into program.

(6)-Fixed assembly errors on LGMHPSTG when less than z/OS V1R10
    by adding new program LGMHPSTX for z/OS V1R7 support.

(7)-Added new JCL member ASMLOGG2 to support assembly of Logger
    Services programs on systems down to z/OS V1R7.

(8)-Added to private area display new detail lines showing
    above-the-bar memory allocations for common memory.

(9)-Added to the General Purpose Register Summary report the
    abending instruction being analyzed.

If you could refresh CBT File 757 with this new fix pack, it
would be greatly appreciated. If you have any questions, please
do not hesitate to ask.

Best regards,
Ken Fitzgerald
