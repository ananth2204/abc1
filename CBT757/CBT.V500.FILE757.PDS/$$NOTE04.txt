Sam:

I have attached file named File757_101008.zip as a #8 fix-pack
for reported problems and user requests.

This version has been tested on z/OS V1R10. The zip file will
contain a file named FILE757.XMI. This Fix Pack replaces all
components at V1R1M07 with V1R1M08.

Member $$FIXPAC in FILE757 has the detail description of changes.
A summary of the changes is as follows:

Change Summary: Fix Pack 8

  (1)-Fixed bug in the DFA version displayed in the Logger
  Services environmental report when running on z/OS V1R10.

  (2)-Fixed bug in token generation on a storage watch where the
  hashing algorithm was not producing sufficient uniform
  distribution to avoid some collisions.

  (3)-Fixed bug in storage configuration display when calculating
  private-area storage use for a multi-tasking program.

  (4)-Added support for the display of a new subpool summary
  report.

  (5)-Added support for the display of access registers in a Log
  Point.

  (6)-Added support for the display of access registers at abend.

  (7)-Added support for the display of additional CPU hardware
  configuration information in the Logger Services environmental
  report.

  (8)-Updated $$DOC text file and $$DOCWRD Word file.

If you could refresh CBT File 757 with this new fix pack, it would
be most appreciated.  If you have any questions, please do not
hesitate to ask.

Best regards,
Ken Fitzgerald
