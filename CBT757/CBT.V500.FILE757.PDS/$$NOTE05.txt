Sam:

I have attached file FILE757_011009.zip as a #9 fix-pack for
reported problems and user requests.

The zip file will contain a file named FILE757.XMI. This Fix
Pack replaces all components at V1R1M08 with V1R1M09.

Member $$FIXPAC in FILE757 has the detail description of
changes. A summary of the changes is as follows:

Change Summary: Fix Pack 9

  (1)-Fixed bug where the condition code bits of the current
  PSW for the user's program were not preserved across the
  call to Logger Services.

  (2)-Fixed bug in retry process. When an abend in user's
  program invalid register values were displayed in the save
  area trace when mixed format save areas.

  (3)-Added support for the display of additional diagnostic
  informatiom when abend in user program including the
  system completion code or user completion code, reason
  code, addressing mode of user program at the time of
  abend, and condition code. Also displayed at abend will be
  a description of the program interrupt code, list of
  reasons for abend, characteristics of the abending
  instruction, characteristics of the target instruction of
  abending execute instruction, and an enhanced save area
  trace display.

  (4)-Updated $$DOC text file and $$DOCWRD Word file.

It would be greatly appreciated if you could refresh CBT
File 757 with this new fix pack. If you have any questions,
please do not hesitate to ask.

Best regards,
Ken Fitzgerald
