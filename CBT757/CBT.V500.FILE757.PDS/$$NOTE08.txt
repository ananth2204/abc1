Sam:

I have attached file FILE757_02062010.zip as a PTF 1 to the
current Fix-Pack #11 in CBT File 757.

The zip file will contain a file named FILE757.XMI. This Fix Pack
11 PTF 1 replaces selected V1R1M11 components, and remains at the
V1R1M11 level. A summary of the changes is as follows:

Change Summary: Fix Pack 11 - PTF 1

(1)-Includes $$DOCWRD component which was not available in V478
    cut of the CBT Tape.

(2)-Minor cosmetic changes, additional comments, and spelling
    corrections.

It would be greatly appreciated if you could update File757 with
these changes. If you have any questions, please do not hesitate
to ask.

Best Regards,
Ken Fitzgerald
