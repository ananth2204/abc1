Sam:

I have attached file FILE757_011208.Zip as a #5 fix-pack for
reported problems.  A new component $$DOCWRD has been
added as a Microsoft Word version of the $$DOC text file.   The
zip file will contain a file named File757.XMI. It replaces all
components at V1R1M04 with V1R1M05.

Member $$FIXPAC has the detail description of the changes.


A summary of the changes is as follows:

Change Summary: Fix Pack 5

Fixed leap-year processing error when processing STCKE
format TOD. Fixed to support the correct conversion of STCKE
TOD values to displayable dates substantially past the year 2042.

Fixed bug in LGCPLOGR copybook when setting residence
mode from LPGMNTRY command.

Added z/OS and JES version information when processing
environmental report by additional parsing of CVT, and using
Subsystem Service Interface 54 call wrapped around an ESTAEX.

Added new file $$DOCWRD as a Microsoft Word version of the
$$DOC EBCDIC text file. This is a new component add and not a
replacement for $$DOC which should be remain.

Updated the $$DOC file.

If you could refresh CBT File 757 with this new fix pack, it would
be greatly appreciated. This Fix Pack would be a SEV3 so the refresh
may be done at your leisure.  If you have any questions, please
do not hesitate to ask.


Best regards,

Ken Fitzgerald
