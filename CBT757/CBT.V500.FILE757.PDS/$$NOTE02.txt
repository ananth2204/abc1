Sam:

I have attached file FILE757_022308.Zip as a #6 fix-pack for
reported problems.  The zip file will contain a file named
File757.XMI. This Fix Pack replaces all components at V1R1M05
with V1R1M06.

Member $$FIXPAC has the detail description of the changes.

A summary of the changes is as follows:

Change Summary: Fix Pack 6

S0C4-11 abends occur in LGMHESTA program on z/OS V1R9.

There are no component fixes to LOGGRASM. To correct this
S0C4 abend, you need to apply the following IBM APAR to
your z/OS V1R9 system:

    OA23937 - RTM FAILS TO PROVIDE A 144 BYTE SAVE AREA
                          AT HBB7740
    PTF UA39304 available 02/20/2008.

Fixed bug when specifying LOGOUT=BUFR option which leads
to a severe WTO Buffer shortage if LOGGRASM encounters a
primary index block overrun.

Fixed bug when specifying LOGTRIM option.

Added job step CPU time used information when requesting
PVTAREA=YES, and added job step CPU time used information
to end of Logger report.

Added expanded job start date and time information to
environmental section of Logger report.

Added GMT local time zone offset information when processing
environmental section of Logger report.

Moved environmental report processing showing z/OS system
information to a separate Rsect.

Updated the $$DOC file.

If you could refresh CBT File 757 with this new fix pack, it would
be greatly appreciated.  If you have any questions, please do not
hesitate to ask.

Best regards,
Ken Fitzgerald
