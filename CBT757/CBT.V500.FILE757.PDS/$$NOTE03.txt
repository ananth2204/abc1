Sam:

I have attached file FILE757_052408.zip as a #7 fix-pack for
reported problems and enhancement requests.  The zip file
will contain a file named FILE757.XMI. This Fix Pack replaces
all components at V1R1M06 with V1R1M07.

Member $$FIXPAC has the detail description of the changes.

A summary of the changes is as follows:

Change Summary: Fix Pack 7

Complete rewrite of abend retry program to position for
further expansion, and for inclusion of additional
fixes and enhancements.

Added support in abend retry program for the display of
user's virtual storage allocations at time of abend
including below the line, above the line, and above the
bar.

Added support in abend retry program for the display of
data set allocations at time of abend including DDname,
EXCP count, data set name, data set disposition status,
and volume serial.

Added support in abend retry program for display of
mixed format save area trace at time of abend.

Added support in abend retry program for recovery of
buffered log records at time of abend.

Fixed bug in close processing during abend retry.

Corrected the return and reason codes displayed to be
consistent with the format documented in IBM reference
manuals for hex or decimal representation.

Updated $$DOC text file and $$DOCWRD Word file. Added
new section documenting Logger Services messages
LGA01101A through LGA01114A, and added a new section on
basic problem solving.

If you could refresh CBT File 757 with this new fix pack, it would
be most appreciated.  If you have any questions, please do not
hesitate to ask.

Best regards,
Ken Fitzgerald
