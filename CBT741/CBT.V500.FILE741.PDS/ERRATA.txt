There is a bug in the original version of MAKEB64 and MAKEB64O
from April 2006. They will go into an output loop if the number
of bytes in the input file is a multiple of 57.

Here is how to correct the code to eliminate the bug.

In this sequence:

   EGET     BAL   R14,GET57           READ 57 INTO IBUF
            LR    R7,R0               GET LENGTH TO ENCODE
            BAL   R14,ENCODE
            LR    R6,R0               GET LENGTH TO PUT
            BAL   R14,PUT76
            CH    R6,=H'76'           IF NO EOF YET
            BE    EGET                   THEN LOOP
            B     EXITN

change the "CH" line to this:

            CLI   GOTEOD,0

so the sequence looks like this:

   EGET     BAL   R14,GET57           READ 57 INTO IBUF
            LR    R7,R0               GET LENGTH TO ENCODE
            BAL   R14,ENCODE
            LR    R6,R0               GET LENGTH TO PUT
            BAL   R14,PUT76
            CLI   GOTEOD,0            IF NO EOF YET
            BE    EGET                   THEN LOOP
            B     EXITN

Then in this sequence:

   GET5E    LA    R0,57
            S     R0,GETREGS+16       COMPUTE HOW MANY BYTES
            L     R14,GETREGS+8
            BR    R14

insert this instruction:

            XC    GETREGS(8),GETREGS

so it looks like this:

   GET5E    LA    R0,57
            S     R0,GETREGS+16       COMPUTE HOW MANY BYTES
            XC    GETREGS(8),GETREGS
            L     R14,GETREGS+8
            BR    R14
