Hi Sam,
I hope someone has a use for this.  I wrote this because one of
my clients was using a very old product called Doc View from CA.
They were unable to install Doc View under Windows 7, which needed
to be rolled out, since XP is no longer supported.  The choices CA
gave them were to buy Web view or CA-Spool.  Both products were a
bit pricey so I came up with this solution for them.

Hope all is well.
