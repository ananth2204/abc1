//***FILE 909 is from Glenn Siegel and it a package to allow you    *   FILE 909
//*           to email CA-Dispatch reports.  Please see the         *   FILE 909
//*           explanations below.                                   *   FILE 909

//*    I wrote this because one of my clients was using a very      *   FILE 909
//*    old product called Doc View from CA.  They were unable       *   FILE 909
//*    to install Doc View under Windows 7, which needed to be      *   FILE 909
//*    rolled out, since XP is no longer supported.  The            *   FILE 909
//*    choices CA gave them were to buy Web view or CA-Spool.       *   FILE 909
//*    Both products were a bit pricey so I came up with this       *   FILE 909
//*    solution for them.                                           *   FILE 909
//*                                                                 *   FILE 909
