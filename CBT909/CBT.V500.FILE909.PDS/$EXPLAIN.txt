How GSMAIL works:

1. Dispatch user exit RDFGEX04 performs the following:
   Takes the destination and email address from each of Dispatch's reports
   with an output class of E and places a message on the console like this:

   GSMAIL1I Report destid   will be emailed to somebody@someplace.com

   Then adds a line to the end of the report with the email address and
   reportid like this:

   EMAIL address = somebody@someplace.com           reportid


2. MPFXTALL retrieves message GSMAIL1I and issues a command on the
   console with the reports destid to start job BUILDWTR like this:
   S BUILDWTR,P=destid

3. BUILDWTR proc executes program BUILDIT that builds and submits JCL for a
   batch job with the jobname of the destid.

4. The destid batch job does the following:
   Step 1 deletes any old destid report dataset if it exists.
   Step 2 creates a dataset containing the report for that DESTID using the XWTR
          program IASXWR00. MPFXTALL assists in setting up and stopping the XWTR
          when the report has been written to the dataset.
          Dataset name is SYSP.DISP.RPT.destid so you may want to define an
          alias of SYSP or change the HLQ in all the programs and proc.
   Step 3 MAILIT program builds and submits JCL for a batch job called MAILIT
          using the email address and reportid added to the bottom of the of the
          report from exit RDFGEX04.

5. MAILIT emails the report using program XMITIP.
