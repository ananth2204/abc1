Hi Sam,

a. you can submit the whole thing from edit session, or excluded
   lines only or not excluded lines only - something like !XSUB NX.
b. only first 80 bytes or less are submitted.
c) 1st card is verified to be a job card.
d) stays in full screen mode.
e) short message in the upper right corner; press PF1 for a long
   message.
f) I use XSUB as module name; for ispf macros in assembler you
   have to use !XSUB. not sure if there is a shortcut?

I had to look thru the code since I wrote it many years ago and
then cleaned up in 1999.
