                            SAVE YOUR ASSETS
                       BACKUP AND RECOVER SYSTEM

THIS DOCUMENT DESCRIBES THE SYA (SAVE YOUR ASSETS) BACKUP AND RECOVERY
SYSTEM. IT IS IMPORTANT TO FOLLOW THE INSTRUCTIONS TO ENSURE A GOOD
BACKUP AND RECOVERY OF THE SELECTED DATASETS.

1.  CREATE A WORK PDS

2.  CREATE A MEMBER WITHIN THE NEWLY CREATED PDS CALLED DATA

3.  EDIT THE MEMBER CALLED DATA AND ENTER DATASET NAMES TO BE BACKED UP
    STARTING IN COLUMN 1. ONLY ONE DATASET NAME PER LINE. DO NOT MIX
    PDS AND SEQUENTIAL DATASETS IN ONE EXECUTION. SAVE THE MEMBER.

4.  IF YOU A WORKING WITH PDS FILES, ENTER SYAPDS ON THE COMMND LINE.
    PRESS ENTER.
    IF YOU A WORKING WITH SEQUENTIAL FILES, ENTER SYAGENER ON THE
    COMMAND LINE. PRESS ENTER.

5.  YOU WILL BE PROMPTED FOR A HEADER FILE NAME. THE HEADER FILE IS
    NORMALLY A GDG FILE. ENTER THE BASE FILE NAME FOR THE HEADER AND
    PRESS ENTER. SEE NOTE.

6.  WHEN THE PROCESS FINISHES, THERE WILL BE THREE FILES IN THE WORK
    PDS: BACKUP, DATA, AND RESTORE. PROVIDE A JOB CARD FOR BACKUP, AND
    SUBMIT THE JOB. BACKUP WILL COPY THE RESTORE JCL YOU HAVE JUST
    BUILT INTO THE HEADER FILE (FILE 1 OF THE TAPE). THE REST OF THE
    BACKUP STREAM WILL BACKUP ALL THE FILES IDENTIFIED IN THE DATA
    MEMBER.

    NOTE: IF A GDG FILE IS NOT USED FOR THE HEADER FILE THE JCL MUST
    BE EDITIED TO REMOVE THE '(0)' IN THE RESTORE HEADER, AND THE (+1)
    IN THE BACKUP HEADER.
