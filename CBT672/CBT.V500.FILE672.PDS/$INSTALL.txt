      Short Installation Instructions for NETINIT and NETSTOP

1.  Assemble the NETINIT program, using (a variation of) the ASSEMBLE
    member, and copy it into an authorized load library that is NOT
    IN THE LINK LIST.

2.  Copy the @NETINIT and @NETSTOP members into your active VTAMLST.

3.  Add the @NETINIT and @NETSTOP entries to your ATCCONxx member in
    VTAMLST.

4.  Activate the nodes @NETINIT and @NETSTOP with

     V NET,ACT,ID=@NETINIT
     V NET,ACT,ID=@NETSTOP

    console commands (or IPL).

  The above steps will make the NETINIT and NETSTOP applications known
  to VTAM.  But we still need to put procs into a PROCLIB so we will
  be able to START them as console commands.  Instructions for that
  are below:

5.  Adapt the NETINIT and NETSTOP procs and their control card inputs
    for your system, and for what you want NETINIT and NETSTOP to do
    for you.  Remember to STEPLIB to the APF authorized library that
    IS NOT IN THE LINK LIST.

6.  In your PARMLIB COMMNDxx member, put an entry:

     COM='S NETINIT'

    if you want NETINIT to kick off after VTAM comes up at IPL time.
    I think that NETINIT, used in this way, can probably replace
    IBM's VTAMAPPL program completely.  And it works on old MVS
    systems that didn't have VTAMAPPL available yet.

7.  Once the NETINIT and NETSTOP procs (or variations thereof) are
    present in PROCLIB, you can S NETINIT or S NETSTOP at any time
    when you want those actions to occur.  VTAM has to be up.

8.  Control card coding rules are as follows (taken from the NETINIT
    source code).  I would suggest making frequent use of the coding
    examples in member PROCLIB, (sub)members NETINIS1 and NETSTOS1,
    which will help you get your commands right.  Be careful to learn
    the hierarchy commands (the level number in column 1 of the control
    card) so you can code one command to be dependent on (a hierarchy
    of) other commands.  And you can learn how to use the time delays.
    All this documentation may be found in the NETINIT source code.

 INPUT:     BELOW IS THE FORMAT FOR AN INPUT COMMAND RECORD.

              3       'V' IF STATUS OF COMMAND WILL BE MONITORED
                          WITH THE INQUIRE MACRO.

 Good Luck!
