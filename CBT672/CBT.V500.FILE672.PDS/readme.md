//***FILE 672 is from Joel Ewing and contains a version of the      *   FILE 672
//*           NETINIT program which works under OS/390 and z/OS.    *   FILE 672
//*           NETINIT was originally part of the NETSOL package.    *   FILE 672
//*           (See an updated version of NETSOL on File 356.)       *   FILE 672
//*                                                                 *   FILE 672
//*           NETINIT will intelligently start VTAM applications    *   FILE 672
//*           and issue arbitrary MVS commands after VTAM is up.    *   FILE 672
//*           NETINIT can probably completely replace IBM's         *   FILE 672
//*           VTAMAPPL program in functionality.  In addition,      *   FILE 672
//*           in its NETSTOP incarnation, NETINIT can take down     *   FILE 672
//*           most of your system, intelligently, too.  Once you    *   FILE 672
//*           have set up your NETINIT and NETSTOP procs and        *   FILE 672
//*           their VTAM applications, you can get them to do       *   FILE 672
//*           very good work.                                       *   FILE 672
//*                                                                 *   FILE 672
//*           NETINIT will work on older MVS systems, where IBM's   *   FILE 672
//*           VTAMAPPL program was not yet available.               *   FILE 672
//*                                                                 *   FILE 672
