)F  XWRITENR is a REXX external routine that functions like the WRITENR
 statement of CLIST language.  In other words, it writes the evaluated
 <expression> to the TSO terminal, without a carriage return.  This is
 available in TSO/E environments only.

 XWRITENR must be invoked via the REXX CALL instruction, in which case
 it places a return code (normally 0) in the RESULT variable.  If
 XWRITENR is invoked as a REXX function, it returns the return code
 as the value.  Exactly one argument must be specified; otherwise
 a return code of -2 is returned.

 In general, a call to XWRITENR should be followed by a statement
 that requests terminal input (PULL, PARSE PULL, or PARSE EXTERNAL).

)X Syntax:
            CALL XWRITENR <expression>

 Note:  Some hex control characters may be used in <expression> to
        produce certain effects:

  '24'x at the end of <expression> causes the keyboard to unlock
  following the message; anything typed in the field where the
  cursor is positioned is NOT DISPLAYED.  A PULL or PARSE EXTERNAL
  instruction will pick up the entered data.  This is useful for
  password prompts.

  '15'x at the end of <expression> acts as a "new line" character,
  so that the cursor is moved to the beginning of the next line.
  In other words, this makes XWRITENR behave like SAY.  Normally
  this is not useful, but it may be useful in conjunction with
  3270 data stream orders.

  Some 3270 data stream commands ('11'x for SBA, '1D'x for SF) may
  be embedded in <expression>.  USE THESE WITH CAUTION!  If the
  expression you want to display might contain invalid characters,
  use TRANSLATE() to remove them before attempting to display with
  XWRITENR, or use SAY instead.

 Example:

  call xwritenr "Enter name:"
  parse pull name
  /* Would display: Enter name: _
     where _ represents the cursor */

  call xwritenr "Enter password:" || '24'X
  parse pull password
  /* Would display: Enter password: _
     where _ represents the cursor.
     The password would be entered in a print-inhibited input field. */
