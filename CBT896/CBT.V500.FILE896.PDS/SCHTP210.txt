+  The TSO/E PRINTDS Hardcopy Output Panel provides the TSO/E user with a
   panel-driven facility to easily produce hardcopy output through foreground
   copying.  Printing is accomplished by using ISPF dialog manager services
   to build a TSO/E PRINTDS command from the options specified by the user in
   the body of the PRINTDS panel.

   The panel provides many of the most frequently used PRINTDS options.  A
   non-VSAM data set name and a printer destination are all that is required
   to initiate printing.  The print data is placed on the spool for printing
   by either JES2/3 or VTAM Printer Support (VPS).

   Range verification for various PRINTDS panel options is provided by the
   PRINTDS dialog.  If an option is not available on the panel, the
   "Miscellaneous options" may be used.  Note, however, that no range
   verification is provided with this option.  The keyword is appended to the
   PRINTDS command as it is entered on the panel.
