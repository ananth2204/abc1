//*       This pds contains both Abe's maclib and the associated    *   FILE 884
//*       samplib.                                                  *   FILE 884

//*       The product is named "Bixoft eXtended Assembly language"  *   FILE 884

//*       Members of this pds are in PDSLOAD format (similar to     *   FILE 884
//*       IEBUPDTE, but containing ISPF statistics).  The PDSLOAD   *   FILE 884
//*       program is packaged with this pds, and the $PDSLOAD       *   FILE 884
//*       member of this pds is a job to create all the libraries.  *   FILE 884
//*                                                                 *   FILE 884
//*       The submission was divided into two parts, originally,    *   FILE 884
//*       called MACLIB and SAMPLIB.  MACLIB contains Abe's entire  *   FILE 884
//*       macro library, while SAMPLIB contained all the other      *   FILE 884
//*       members:  ASM, JCL, LKED, MACJCL, PROCLIB.                *   FILE 884
//*                                                                 *   FILE 884
