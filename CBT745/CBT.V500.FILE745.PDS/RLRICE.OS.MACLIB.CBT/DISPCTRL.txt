*     DISPCTRL is a table in EDCOMM.                                  *
*                                                                     *
*     This table is to make EDLINE's life easier.                     *
*     There is an entry per line on EDIT displays.                    *
*     The screen builder (like EDNORMO or EDHEXO) "know" that         *
*     it is displaying on each line.  The line command interpreter    *
*     does not.  Some lines allow commands to be entered on that      *
*     line, others do not.  For example, when in HEX mode, line       *
*     commands are allowed only on the CHARACTER line.  Also,         *
*     SEQ blocks do not exist for all lines (like the blank lines     *
*     between rows of hex displays).  So, rather than have EDLINE     *
*     and other stuff "figure out" what was sent out per line,        *
*     the program that builds the display builds the DISPCTRL table   *
*     at the same time.                                               *
*                                                                     *
*                                                                     *
