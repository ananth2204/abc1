OS determines a data set's DSORG and reads the data using
the appropriate (I hope) method.  Sequential data sets and
PDS'es are read with BSAM and BPAM using a DCB.  VSAM data
sets are read with an ACB.  For VSAM, OS sets the OPTCDs in
the RPL's depending on the type of VSAM.  That is KSDS's
need different OPTCDs than an ESDS so OS determines the type
of VSAM data set and sets the OPTCD accordingly.

If the data set name is a UNIX PATH, OS determines the type
of file (file, directory, link, ...).  If the path is a link,
OS determines the real name and determines the type of file
again.  If the path (or real name) is a directory, OS displays
the files in the directory.  Since UNIX file names can be
long, some of the names may be truncated.  If the path is a
file, OS displays the contents of the file.
