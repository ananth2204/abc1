The whole idea in developing On Screen is to allow data to be
"custom" formatted.

Most types of data sets have a default format.  Sequential files,
PDS members, VSAM files, HFS 'files' default to 'BROWSE'.  PDS or
PDS/E directories default to a member list.

The default format can be overridden when starting OS by using the
FORMAT keyword (or one of it's abbreviations) when starting OS.

Assume you have a sequential file that contains SMF data:
  OS DSN=SMF.DATA F=SMF
The "F=" keyword over-rides BROWSE as the default format.


You can switch formats by entering "FORMAT xxxxxx" in the primary
command area.  Entering "FORMAT" with no format name causes OS
to switch to the default format.  Assume you find a data set
and are not sure of the contents.  Also assume it is a seuqential
file.  If you enter   OS 'some.unknown.data'
OS will display the contents using BROWSE.  After browsing the
data, you realize the data is SMF data.  You can switch to SMF
record formatting by entering "FORMAT SMF" in the command area.
If you want to switch back to BROWSE, enter "FORMAT BROWSE" or
just "FORMAT".


Some formats like BROWSE are used so frequently, I made their names
primary commands.  So to switch to BROWSE, you can enter
"FORMAT BROWSE" or just "BROWSE" as a primary command.  The FORMATS
I chose to make primary commands are BROWSE, HEX, VHEX, and SMF.

You can obtain a list of available formats by entering:
  FL
  LIST
  FLIST
