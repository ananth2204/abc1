Each PDS, sequential file, or PDS member "OS'd" is considered a
"session".

For example if you start On Screen by displaying the members in a
PDS(/E), the member list display itself is a "session".  If you browse
(with the S, B, or V line command or primary commands), On Screen
creates a second "session".  You may display your active sessions by
entering "SESS" or "SESSION" as a primary command.


The session display shows one line for each "session"

You may switch "sessions" by entering a non-blank in the line command
area.
