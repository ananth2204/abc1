APPENDs the data set or PDS member to the end of an existing
sequential file or PDS member

When used as a line command on a PDS(/E) member display, the
member will be Appended.


When used as a primary command (in the COMMAND=> area) on a PSE(/E)
member display


  If the command is "A(PPEND) mmmmmmmm"
     the specified member will be Appended


  If the command is "A(PPEND)" with no member name,
     all "TAGGED" members will be APPENDED




You will be prompted for the output data set or member to use for
Appending the data.








Up to three of 'separator' lines can be generated before or
following each member.


   Variables available for customizing the separator lines:


    &DSN     data set name
