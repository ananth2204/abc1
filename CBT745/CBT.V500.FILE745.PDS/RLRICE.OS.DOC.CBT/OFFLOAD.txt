OFFLOAD the member or sequential file to another sequential file or
PDS member.  If the file or member already exists, it is overwritten.

When used as a line command on a PDS or PDS/E display, the member will
be Offloaded.


When used as a primary command (in the COMMAND=> area) on a PDS or PDS/E
member display..
  If the command is "O(FFLOAD) mmmmmmm"
     then only member "mmmmmm" is O(FFLOAD)ed

  If the command is "O(FFLOAD)"  with no member name,
     all "TAGGED" members will be O(FFLOAD)ed



You will be prompted for the name of the output data set or PDS(/E)
member to use for the output.
