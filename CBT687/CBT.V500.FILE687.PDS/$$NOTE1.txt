 Asunto:        USEFUL CLIST TO SHARE (Job to diagnose VVDS)


Hello folks,

I want to SHARE with you, the following CLIST and SKEL. I think
 that can be good to share some JOB's and CLIST's that are USEFUL
 for all.

The CLIST only prepare a JOB to diagnose all of your catalogs
  against all of your VVDS and vice versa.

You need to copy the clist to one allocated CMDPROC with the name
 VVDS, and the SKEL to one allocated ISPSLIB with the name VVDS.

I test in our installation, all the catalogs are ICFCATALOG, we
 don't use VSAM catalogs, and all dasd are ONLINE. We have z/OS
 1.3

To test it execute the clist: TSO VVDS

The execution time of the CLIST depend of the number of UCAT's
 and VVDS's, about 1 to 5 minutes (1000 to 5000 online vols).
