//***FILE 687 is from Jose Maria (Chema) Alvarez and contains       *   FILE 687
//*           a package to compare catalogs mentioned in VVDS'es    *   FILE 687
//*           on DASD volumes, and see if they are actually         *   FILE 687
//*           connected to the real catalog in the system.          *   FILE 687
//*                                                                 *   FILE 687
//*           A CLIST and and ISPF skeleton are provided.  The      *   FILE 687
//*           output of the CLIST is a job, which is presented      *   FILE 687
//*           to you in ISPF edit.  Running this job enables you    *   FILE 687
//*           to compare your referenced catalogs in a VVDS to      *   FILE 687
//*           those that are actually connected to the system.      *   FILE 687
//*           Then you can decide if any adjustments are necessary. *   FILE 687
