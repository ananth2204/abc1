//*           to HTTP requests.  This proof-of-concept application  *   FILE 775
//*           is the subject of SHARE presentation 8247, presented  *   FILE 775

//*       The two significant members of this pds, called SOURCE    *   FILE 775
//*       and COPYBOOK, are in an IEBUPDTE-like unloaded pds        *   FILE 775
//*       format called PDSLOAD-format.  A job to create the two    *   FILE 775
//*       required pds'es is included here, and it is in the        *   FILE 775
//*       member $PDSLOAD.  The member called PDSLOAD contains      *   FILE 775
//*       the PDSLOAD program, in TSO XMIT format, and it is        *   FILE 775
//*       unloaded into a real load library by the $PDSLOAD job.    *   FILE 775
