Installation Note:  This pds was created from Craig's zip file, and
    its members are in a modified IEBUPDTE-like format, which preserves
    ISPF statistics, called PDSLOAD format.  To restore the pds'es
    that contain the source and copybook members, please run the job
    in the member called $PDSLOAD.  It will create a temporary load
    library containing the PDSLOAD program, and will then STEPLIB to
    it, and create the install pds'es required.
