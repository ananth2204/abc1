Subject: New submission, in support of SHARE presentation 8247

 ---------------------------------------------------------------------

Installation Note:  This pds was created from Craig's zip file, and
    its members are in a modified IEBUPDTE-like format, which preserves
    ISPF statistics, called PDSLOAD format.  To restore the pds'es
    that contain the source and copybook members, please run the job
    in the member called $PDSLOAD.  It will create a temporary load
    library containing the PDSLOAD program, and will then STEPLIB to
    it, and create the install pds'es required.

 ---------------------------------------------------------------------

The enclosed file contains COBOL source code and copybooks for a
proof-of-concept application I wrote, CICS COBOL responding to HTTP
requests.  This proof-of-concept application is the subject of SHARE
presentation 8247, presented in San Diego in August of 2007 and to be
presented again in Orlando in February of 2008.

I'd like to point people at the cbttape.org website for these files
instead of the SHARE website because the SHARE site administrators
insist that all files be in Adobe PDF format.  I think the XMIT
format is more friendly to mainframe source code.


Best wishes,

Craig Schneiderwent
