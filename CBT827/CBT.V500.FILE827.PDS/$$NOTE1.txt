Hi Sam,

rlpv22.xmi is an updated version of the RACF profile utility.  I
added some requested features, including:

- A simple user options panel;
- The option of confirm/noconfirm for profile deletes;
- The option to have the dialog display the RACF commands being
  issued "under the covers"  for each operation done. This is a
  good learning tool for those new to RACF;
- For DATASET class, the ability to enter a fully qualified
  dataset name in the "Filter" field, in which case the list of
  profiles is narrowed down to the one profile that covers the
  dataset entered.  This is useful when one needs to grant
  permission to a dataset, but is unsure of which profile to
  tweak.
- Fixed assorted bugs and cleaned things up a bit, improving
  support for some RACF classes.

This xmi file can be downloaded from my web site at:

Let me know if there are any problems with the files.

All best -

John
