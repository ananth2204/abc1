  -----------------------------------------------------------------
  This set of ISPF components comprise an ISPF based method of
  maintaining RACF dataset profiles.  Coded using Rexx, the dialog
  is invoked by entering the Exec name, RFLD, from the ISPF option
  6 panel, or by entering TSO RFLD from other ISPF command lines.
  Example:

  EDIT ---- DATASET.NAME($$$$DOC) - 01.00 ----------------- 009 080
  COMMAND ===> TSO RFLD

  A filter criteria can optionally be specified on the command line
  to change the list of profiles displayed.   The default is to
  display profiles beginning with the user's TSO USERID.  The filter
  criteria can also be changed at will on the main RFLD panel.

  Once on the main RFLD panel, the line commands allow various
  operations to be performed on the RACF profiles, including full-screen
  manipulation of the access lists.

  the indicated library.  The library indicated is the DDNAME of
  the TSO allocation environment, and will be different for each
  site.

RFLD - Dialog to Maintain RACF Dataset Profiles

What it does:
-----------------------------------------------
This ISPF dialog lets you conveniently maintain access lists, and
do lots of other RACF tasks that are cumbersome to perform using
the IBM supplied RACF ISPF panels.  This dialog works with any
kind of resource, including dataset profiles and general resource
classes.


How to transfer file to the MVS host.
-----------------------------------------------

- Create a PDS on the MVS system, called userid.TEMP, or some
  such name.  CYL(1,1,15) is big enough.
  RECFM=FB,LRECL=80,BLKSIZE=6160 are suitable DCB parameters.

- Download the RFLD.EXE self-extracting file to a PC.  Place
  RFLD.EXE in a directory by itself, and run it.  This will
  result in all required members being extracted. (These won't be
  readable on a PC  See note below)

- FTP all the extracted files from the PC to the MVS PDS
  allocated in the first step.  Use the FTP subcommand: "BINARY"
  or equivalent to specify a binary transfer.  This is a must.
  (These FTP'd files become members of the target PDS.)

- Read the $$$$$DOC member in the PDS for further instructions.


NOTE: The files that are in this self-extracting zip file are in
EBCDIC format, so they will look like garbage on the PC, even
after being extracted.  They will however be normal, readable
EBCDIC PDS members after they are extracted and transferred to an
MVS host using Binary mode.
