A ZAP to improve CICS statistics

The CICS shutdown statistics contain vital information
regarding CICS resource usage.  One critical piece of
information that is omitted is about transactions and programs.
While the statistics report will tell you how often each
transaction and program was used, it does not list the
transactions and programs that were not used.  This
information is very important if you want to clean up obsolete
transaction and program definitions: it's much harder to track
which of these are not being used than it is to monitor which
ones are used.  CICS/ESA statistics do include this
information, but previous releases do not.

We came up with a ZAP for CICS/MVS 2.1.1 that will result
in the shutdown statistics listing all the programs and
transactions, even those that were not used.  By applying this
temporarily (for one month, for example) you can ascertain
which program and transaction-ids are obsolete and remove
them from the CSD.  This will result in a small saving of CICS
resources, but the greatest gain is administrative: the
elimination of unnecessary resource definitions.

One word of caution if you implement this: if you periodically
take interval statistics, the shutdown statistics may indicate that
some programs and/or transactions were not used.  In fact, this
only means that the programs or transactions were not used
since the last interval statistics were taken.

Below are the AMASPZAP commands to apply the ZAP in a
CICS/MVS 2.1.1 environment.  This ZAP should work in
other releases of CICS as well, but you will have to research
the specific offsets for the instructions in question and adjust
the AMASPZAP statements accordingly.  Finally, we did not
apply this as a USERMOD (I have an aversion to
USERMODs).  We simply created a temporary version of
DFHSTPD for the period of time we monitored the statistics
for unused programs and transactions.  I would recommend this
approach.
