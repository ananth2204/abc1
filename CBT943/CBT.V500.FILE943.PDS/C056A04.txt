Locating the CICS CSA in a dump

One of the more difficult tasks in debugging an operating
system or stand-alone dump of the CICS region is locating the
CSA.  If register 13 doesn't point to the CSA, most
programmers resort to scanning the dump, hoping that
something will catch their eye enabling them to identify this
control block.  However, an understanding of the relationship
between CICS and MVS can take most of the work out of this
task.

The first 72 bytes of the CSA are used as an operating system
save area.  This area is established and chained to other control
blocks early in the life-cycle of a CICS region.  Following the
necessary pointers to get to the CSA is an easy task.

If you have an operating system dump (SYSUDUMP or
SYSABEND) of the CICS region it is very likely that a save
area trace is printed just before the start of the actual program
dump.  The first save area on the chain is one that is
established by the operating system and passed to CICS to be
used to save the contents of the registers on entry to DFHSIP.
Once CICS has created the CSA, it chains the save area in the
CSA to this operating system save area.  Therefore the address
of the second save area in the save area trace is the address of
the CSA.

If you have a stand-alone dump of the CICS region, there is an
address in the Task Control Block (TCB) for DFHSIP called
the First Save Area (FSA), and located X'70' bytes from the
beginning of the TCB.  Go to the address contained in the FSA
field and you will be at the first save area established by the
operating system.  Eight bytes into this save area is the forward
pointer to the next save area on the chain, which is the one at
the beginning of the CSA.
