Installing MRO - a user's experience

INTRODUCTION

The following is a summary of changes, based on our
experience, needed to install Multi-Region Operation (MRO).
Even though IBM supplies the Intercommunication Facilities
Guide (SC33-0133), it is still somewhat difficult to get all the
necessary information together.  The following examples are
all based on CICS 1.7 running under VSE/SP 3.1.  This article
is not intended to be a thorough examination of MRO, but it
should be a quick help for anyone about to get started, or to
give them an idea what they have to look out for and where
they will have to change their systems to get MRO running.

GENERAL POINTS

Before you change your CICS system to an MRO system you
should consider  all  other options.  If you are running under
VM you might be able to avoid the necessity of splitting your
CICS into an MRO system by installing a VTAM server
machine and by using a cross-domain channel to channel
adapter.  This solution, if possible, should cost you less in
terms of resources.

The following examples are based on the assumption that you
have two CICS systems - CICSA, where all terminals are
attached, and CICSB, which is only accessed by remote
transactions from CICSA.  Some datasets will need to be
accessed by both CICS systems.  These datasets are normally
defined in CICSA and are accessed by CICSB using function
shipping (ie the dataset is defined as REMOTE in the CICSB
FCT).

Before you start installing MRO, call your IBM software
support and check if you need to install any PTF/APARs for
the MRO functions.  APAR PL38924 is definitely needed if
you want to have security checking between your MRO
systems, which I would recommend (TCT parameter
USERSEC=IDENTIFY).  In Release 3.1 we had to install quite
a few PTF/APARs for both MRO and function shipping with
DL/I.  Some of these PTF/APARs are still needed in Release 4.
Without the PTFs you will get misleading error messages and
when you use function shipping with DL/I you will have
unpredictable results.

It is important to know that you should not install CICS PTFs
while running CICS.  The installation procedure changes the
status of the libraries to 'immediate', which means that changes
to phases will be active the very next time that CICS loads that
phase.  This can cause unpredictable results, especially when
you try to terminate CICS.  It may be impossible to warm-start
your CICS afterwards.  You should install the PTFs after CICS
has been terminated and start CICS afterwards with a cold
start.  Changes to certain phases (for example the TCT phases)
will only be active after a cold start.

Upon installing MRO you will have problems with all
transactions that do not use upper case translation (see the TCT
UCTRAN parameter), for example programs such as text
editors.  If these transactions are to be used as remote
transactions, they will set UCTRAN to off in the TCT where
they are started, but will not change the TCT in the CICS that
runs the transaction (ie transaction routing).  To correct this
problem, you will have to use a user exit similar to the one
described in CICS Update Issue 46, September 1989, page 3,
to change UCTRAN for the necessary transactions.  You will
also find that many software products have user exits available
for MRO and detailed explanations of the necessary changes
for that product to run under MRO.

Entries for DFHIRP, DFHSCTE, and DFHCSEOT must be
included in your Shared Virtual Area (SVA).  You should also
include in the SVA all CICS modules that are used by both
systems.  This reduces the size of the CICS nucleus of both
CICS systems and increases the reliability - the modules cannot
be destroyed by storage violations etc.  If you don't already
have these modules in your SVA you will have to increase the
size of your SVA considerably (the overall size is decreased
because the modules are only present once in the system -
otherwise they are present for each CICS system).

CHANGES TO THE SIT

The following entries are required in the SIT for all MRO-
related systems.

               APPLID=applid,           CICS APPLICATION NAME          *
               EXEC=YES,                EXEC LEVEL SUPPORT             *
               ICVTSD=0,                TERMINAL SCAN DELAY            *
               IRCSTRT=YES,             YES INTERREGION COMMUNICATION  *
*     This can also be NO but then must be opened manually
*     ie CEMT S IRC OPE
               ISC=YES,                 YES INTERSYSTEM COMMUNICATION  *
               SYSIDNT=name,            FOR DUAL-PURPOSE DEFS.         *

where applid is TSTCICA and name is CICA for the CICSA
system, and similarly applid is TSTCICB and name is CICB
for the CICSB system.  All references to the CICSA system are
made through the SYSIDNT=CICA entry and all references to
the CICSB with SYSIDNT=CICB.  In the TCT,  references are
made to the SYSIDNT and the NETNAME, which should be
identical to the APPLID of the system to be accessed.

CHANGES TO THE PCT

The following PCT entries are necessary in both CICSA and
CICSB for the mirror transactions (function shipping).  They
are required because the GROUP entry defaults to RSLC=YES
instead of RSLC=NO.  If you are using RSLC you will not
need these entries - the DFHPCT TYPE=GROUP,FN=(ISC)
entry will be sufficient.  If you are using RDO you will have to
change the transactions in the group DFHISC.

The following entries in the CICSA PCT are necessary for the
REMOTE transactions (transaction routing).  The transactions
will be called in the CICSA system but will run in CICSB
because of the TYPE=REMOTE and the SYSIDNT=CICB
entries - the only changes necessary to make a transaction
remote.

CHANGES TO THE TCT

Changes in the TCT TYPE=SYSTEM entries require a cold
start of the impacted CICS systems, otherwise you will receive
the message

    DFH1010E INSTALL FAILED FOR RDT ...........

and the changes will not be active.  If you restart CICS this
message will not appear again, but if you don't cold start CICS
the changes will not be in effect.  Even IBM had trouble
identifying this problem.

The TYPE=SYSTEM TCT entries communicate with one
another with SEND and RECEIVE entries,  and these must
correspond - eg six SEND entries in CICSA must have six
RECEIVE entries on the CICSB side and vice versa.

The USERSEC parameter in the TYPE=SYSTEM TCT entry
should be specified as LOCAL if security is required only at
the link level or IDENTIFY if security is required at the
link/user level, which respects user TRANSEC parameters.

The following TCT entries are needed in CICSA for the link
connection to CICSB:

Instead of entering REMOTE for each terminal, you identify
all the subsequent terminals as belonging to the CICSA system
until a LOCAL parameter switches back to the local CICS.

DL/I AND FCT CHANGES

The following entries in the CICSA system are necessary for
function shipping.  To allow programs from the CICSB system
to access PSBs in the CICSA system you must use the
parameter REMOTE=YES in the CONFIG entry.  In addition,
all PSBs that will only be accessed from the CICSB system
must be entered in a DFHMIR program entry (which does all
function shipping).

The following entries in the CICSB system FCT are necessary
for function shipping to CICSB.  The dataset is defined in the
CICSA FCT.

The DLZACTentries for DL/I PSB function shipping from
CICSB to CICSA are:
