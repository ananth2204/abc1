 Locating entries in FCT under CICS 1.7
Our installation migrated from CICS 1.6 to 1.7 at the beginning of this year.
CICS 1.7 provides many more facilities over the older releases but at the same
time some macros were no longer supported.  One of these macros which we
encountered was DFHFC TYPE=LOCATE.  This macro was used in a program to locate
specific dataset name entries in the FCT.  In CICS 1.6, this macro is expanded
as follows:
          LA    5,FRPCOLST      LOAD ADDRESS OF PARA LIST
          ST    5,TCAFCAA       STORE TO  TCA
          .
          logic  to  set  up  the  required  data  set  name
          .
 *        DFHFC TYPE=LOCATE
+         MVI   TCAFCTR,B'11110000' MOVE TYPE OF REQUEST TO TCA
+         MVI   TCAFCRI,B'0'        MOVE TYPE OF REQUEST TO TCA
+         L     14.CSAFCNAC         LOAD FILE CONTROL ENTRY ADDR
+         BALR  14,14               GO TO FILE CONTROL
          .
          logic to check the return status and get entry address
          .
 *        PARAMETER LIST FOR LOCATING FILE ENTRIES
 FRPCOLST DC CL8' '                 DATA SET NAME TO BE LOCATED
 FRPCOLER DS 0B                     RETURN ERROR CODE
 FRPCOLAD DC A(0)                   RETURN FCT ENTRY ADDRESS
          .
          .
          END
Upon returning from file control, FRPOCLAD should contain the FCT entry address
or low-values if the entry is not found.  In CICS 1.7 this macro is not
supported.  We tried to code similar (expanded) instructions but it did not
work.  We also found that there is a new macro DFHFC CTYPE=LOCATE which is shown
in the Data Areas manual.  We tried it in our program and discovered that the
parameter list and response indication have all changed.  There was no other
documentation on the exact usage of this macro and we could not get it to work.
We were informed that this macro is for IBM internal use only and that we should
not use it as it will not work for us.
Finally, we managed to solve our problem by coding our own logic to scan the FCT
for the requested entry as follows:
         COPY  DFHCSADS
         COPY  DFHTCADS
         COPY  DFHFCTDS
FCTDSBAR EQU   9
BASE     EQU   11
DSNLOCT  CSECT
         BALR  BASE,0
         USING *,BASE
         USING DFHFCTDS,FCTDSBAR
         .
         logic to allow input of the required dataset
         names and store it into FRPCOLST.
         .
         XR    R5,R5                CLEAR R5
         XR    FCTDSBAR,FCTDSBAR
         L     FCTDSBAR,CSAFCTBA    LOAD FCT ENTRY ADDRESS
LOCATE   CLC   FRPCOLST(8),FCTDSID  COMPARE DSN
         BE    FOUND                WHEN EQUAL, BRANCH TO FOUND
         CLC   FCTDSID,HIGHVAL      ELSE CHECK FOR END OF TABLE
         BE    NOTFD                HIGHVALUE - ENTRY NOT FOUND
         LH    R5,FCTDSTEL            ELSE, LOAD LENGTH OF ENTRY
         AR    FCTDSBAR,R5            BUMP TO NEXT FCT ENTRY
         B     LOCATE               COMPARE NEXT ENTRY
NOTFD    .
         logic to handle condition when entry not found
         .
FOUND    .
         action/logic for entry found condition.
          .
HIGHVAL  DC    FL8'-1'              HIGH-VALUE FOR END OF TABLE
FRPCOLST DC       CL8' '               TO STORE REQUESTED DSN
         .
         .
         END   DSNLOCT
