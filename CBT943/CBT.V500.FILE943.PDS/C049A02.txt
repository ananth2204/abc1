Extracting information from the CSD - a response

I venture to suggest that there is an easier way to scan the CSD
for 'lost' entries (CICS Update, September 1989), by use of the
VIEW function of the CEDA transaction.  The use of masks in
the command allows all or restricted numbers of groups to be
searched.  If only one hit is found, the full entry will be
displayed: if more than one hit, then a list is displayed for
selection.  The following examples will make things clearer.

EXAMPLE ONE

Search for a specific program (DFHXJCC) in all groups
prefixed with 'DFH':

    View PROGram(DFHXJCC) Group(DFH*)

EXAMPLE TWO

Search for all programs prefixed with 'ABC' in all groups:

    View PROG(ABC*) Group(*)

EXAMPLE THREE

Search for all transactions with 'Z' as the second character in all
groups with 'TEST' in positions 2-5 of the group name:

    View TRAN(+Z++) Group(+TEST*)

This search facility works under CICS 2.1 running under
MVS/XA.  I don't know whether CICS 1.6 or CICS 1.7 have
the same facility.

ÝEditors note: The VIEW facility was introduced in CICS 1.7¨
