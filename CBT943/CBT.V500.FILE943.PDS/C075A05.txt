CICS security - part five

This final part of the series of articles on CICS security
provides the sign-on interface for GENER/OL users, and a
simple SELCOPY program which will provide a report of the
V999 sign-on code file.


The GENER/OL interface

The assumption made is that because the user has already
signed on using the CICS security programs defined in the last
four articles, it is unnecessary, and often undesirable, to force
the user to sign on  again.  Note that GENER/OL does not
allow the user to change his  password, so while the sign-on
system may force him to do so, there is no way he can change
his GENER/OL password to reflect any changes.  For those
installations who decide that they still require the user to sign
on separately to GENER/OL, there is an extra facility which
allows the user to enter his name and password along with the
transaction code, thereby bypassing the tedious GENER/OL
sign-on panel (which  only accept the name at first, then
requests the password).  Note that these facilities are only
available to users of GENER/OL applications, who are
immediately directed to an application panel after log-on.  It is
not possible to use the application building or maintenance
facilities.  To use the full GENER/OL facilities, it is always
necessary to log on to GENER/OL in the normal way.

GENER/OL is written in command level and the sign-on
bypass requires that a COMMAREA is passed to the
GENER/OL programs.  It has therefore been necessary to write
the interface in command level for compatibility.

To achieve the effect of immediate log-on to GENER/OL, the
user names defined to GENER/OL should match the three-byte
CICS operator-id.  In addition, this field is the only way of
identifying the sign-on code used,  especially in earlier versions
of  CICS, so the operator-id must also represent the key field of
the V999 record for the associated user.  This version of the
program assumes that the operator name as specified in the
V999 record is exactly the same as the operator-id.  An
alternative to changing all the operator names is to set up an
alternate index, which uses the operator-id as the key.  If  this
latter option is taken, the EXEC CICS READ DATASET
should be changed to reflect the alternate index name and the
new key.

The GENER/OL transaction code is in the format GOLn,
where n is the number of the GENER/OL library which it is
intended to access.  Because GENER/OL uses that transaction
code internally, it is not possible to use the same code for this
interface.  However, the GENER/OL program which accepts
the sign-on expects the transaction code to be in this format.
This is circumvented by defining the transaction code for this
interface (program name GOLSTART), as GLLn.  The
program itself will change the second character of the
transaction  code back to an 'O'.  Note that a corresponding
GLLn transaction code will be required for each GOLn
transaction.  The PCT entries are simple, requiring no TWA,
and PPT entries should simply specify the program as
Assembler.

If the full immediate log-on is required, ie only the transaction
code is entered, this program will read the required information
from the V999 file and set up a COMMAREA with the name
and password inserted.  The alternative is to enter the
transaction in the following format:

      GLLn,name,password

Notes

1      Where the user is presented with a blank screen with the
      cursor in the top left hand corner, there will be no SBA
      and address read into the program.  However, if the cursor
      is at any other position on the screen,  the address will be
      present.  We are not concerned with where on the screen
      the transaction code is entered, so this code checks if the
      SBA sequence exists, and overwrites it if it does.

2      This instruction alters the GLLn transaction code to GOLn.

3      If the transaction code is followed by a comma, it is
      assumed that the long form of signing on is required, ie
      transaction code, comma, name, comma, and password.

4      This code fills in the COMMAREA, in the format required
      by GENER/OL.


Sign-on file report

This is a simple report produced using SELCOPY, which prints
a single line containing the CICS operator name, the date the
sign-on code was last used, and the full name of the user.
Where a sign-on code has not been used for 90 days, it is
flagged as 'NOT USED'.  Similarly, where a password has
expired, this will also be flagged.  This line is followed by a
list of the transactions to which the user has access.

The first line is of particular use to the security administrator in
that it provides data on sign-on codes which may have gone
into disuse.  Experience shows that auditors ask questions
about the checking of such things, so a monthly report can
indicate to the security administrator where perhaps a sign-on
code has become redundant.

The following lines displaying the transactions available to
particular users might also be of use to the security
administrator, but was originally produced for the benefit of,
and at the request of, the auditors.  It provides them with an
instant view of what each user has access to in terms of
application and system transactions.

Notes

1      The NOP prevents SELCOPY producing scales on the top
      page of the report.

2      This  is a simple report heading.  The system name given
      (in this example PRODCICS) should be changed to reflect
      the CICS system names allocated to your systems.  Note
      that the layout of the report is self-explanatory, so no
      column headings have been included.

3      Remember to change the password to reflect the one used
      in your VSAM definition for the file.  Remember that the
      password here should be the file READPW, and not the
      catalog password.
