More on CICS links - a warning

In the July 1990 issue of CICS Update, the article More on
CICS links outlines a method to decrease CPU consumption
while linking to heavily-used routines.  In the invoking
program all the EXEC CICS LINK commands (except the first)
are changed to standard calls.  During the first link, the address
of the routine is passed to a stub in the invoking program.
When we developed a similar method more than two years ago
we encountered a problem that originates from the program
compression process.

When a program compression takes place after the first EXEC
CICS LINK and before one of the calls, the retained address is
no longer valid.  The task using the address will, most
probably, be abended and the whole CICS region is
endangered.  Our solution was to start the stub with:

      EXEC CICS LOAD PROGRAM(PGMNAME) SET(PTR-REF) ENTRY(PTR-REF) HOLD

The hold option ensures that the program remains in main
storage until a release command is issued.  Following the load,
the calls are issued (the entry address is given in the entry
option of the load) and when the invoking program does not
need the routine any more, it issues EXEC CICS
RELEASE(PGMNAME).
