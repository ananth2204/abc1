 CICS tuning parameters - a further comment
Alida Jatich, a regular contributor to CICS Update, has pointed out that Kenneth
MarquardtUs advice in his article CICS tuning parameters in the January 1988
issue, against using auxiliary temporary storage on the grounds that access to
it is single-threaded, no longer holds true.  In Release 1.6.1, the TSP
parameter in the SIT was changed to enable users to define a number of strings
and buffers for the use of the auxiliary temporary storage dataset.  This TSP
parameter is replaced by the TS parameter in Release 1.7.  Similarly, additional
buffers and strings for the VSAM intra-partition dataset can be defined in the
TDP parameter (CICS 1.6.1) and the TD parameter (CICS 1.7 and above) to reduce
contention with this dataset.
