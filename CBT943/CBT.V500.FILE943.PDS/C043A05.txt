Enhanced addressability

When using the CICS LINK command, data is usually passed
between programs in the COMMAREA.  Although this is fine for
most applications, this method presents two troublesome aspects.
First, the information must generally be moved to and from the
area used as the COMMAREA.  Second, the COMMAREA tends
to be unique to each program.  For example, if two programs are
going to perform the same operation on different records both
programs generally have their own COMMAREA description.
Each description contains the appropriate record layout.  Since
both programs are substantially the same it would be much easier
and neater if the COMMAREAs were identical.

Although this is a trivial example, I'm sure anyone working with
CICS can think of several instances where basically the same
thing happens.  What is needed to solve these problems is a
general method of passing information that can handle multiple
record descriptions and at the same time allow one program to
access data directly in the working storage of another.  The
following Assembler program solves these problems by allowing
COBOL programs to pass the address of data rather than the data
itself.

In COBOL, CICS supports the use of addresses using the
LINKAGE SECTION.  Usually this facility is used in conjunction
with the CICS commands ADDRESS or GETMAIN.  This is
however very restricting as ADDRESS only allows access to
internal CICS areas while GETMAIN can become very sloppy
and confusing if used routinely.  This program will allow you to
obtain the address of any data area in working storage.  This
address is then passed, and the program you LINK to can access
the data directly to either inspect or modify it.

USING THE PROGRAM

To use the program the following statement is executed:

    CALL 'IF3000' using data-area data-addr.

where data-area is any data area in working storage and data-addr
is a PIC S9(8) COMP field that you want to contain the address of
data-area. The program will place the address of data-area in the
field data-addr.  This address can be passed to any LINKed
program in the COMMAREA.  To access the area pointed to by
this address, the receiving program must set up the required
LINKAGE SECTION entries (discussed in the CICS Application
Programmers Reference Manual).  The receiving program
executes SERVICE RELOAD ADDRESS-CELLS.  The address
is moved to its correct address cell.  The receiving program must
then execute SERVICE RELOAD 01 data-area (see skeleton
program examples).  The receiving program is now able to access
the working storage of the program that linked to it.  The
procedure is slightly different using VS COBOL II but the
differences are described in the manual.

CAUTION

One word of caution - when programs start using addresses they
can legally access virtually any area within the CICS region.  This
can cause tremendous problems if a program modifies part of
another program or CICS itself.  This is further complicated by
the fact that this kind of problem is usually unpredictable,
intermittent, inconsistent and generally can only be traced using
dumps.  Even with the dump it is often very difficult to track the
offending program.  Nevertheless, when used correctly this is a
very powerful tool which greatly enhances, standardises, and even
simplifies routine data passing.
