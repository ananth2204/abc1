RDO and PA/PF key program invocation

We currently run CICS/MVS 2.1.1 under MVS/XA, with CA-
ACF2 Version 5.2 as our security software.

As part of our movement from the 'backwoods' towards the
leading edge of technology, we decided to implement RDO. It
is in the area of PCT replacement that we encountered some
problems, which, although referenced within the RDO manual
(CICS/MVS V2.1 Resource Definition (Online) SC33-0508-0),
could well be overlooked. Specifically, we have a program
which is invoked, not by a primary transaction-id but, instead,
by a TASKREQ key identifier. The PCT entry is:

      PA1      DFHPCT TYPE=ENTRY,PROGRAM=PFD199,TASKREQ=PA1

The transaction-id 'generated' by CICS, which can be
referenced via the EIBTRNID field and is defined to CA-
ACF2, is a hexadecimal representation of the TASKREQ, ie
the AID value for the key plus X'FF' padding. For PA1 this is
X'6CFFFFFF'.

However, migrate the PCT to RDO and the situation changes.
Under RDO every transaction must have a genuine primary
transaction-id, and RDO automatically assigns a transaction-id
to key-invoked 'transactions'. The value assigned corresponds
to the key specified in the TASKREQ parameter. In our
example, therefore, transaction PA1 was created. View the
new transaction under CEDC and the following is shown:

      TRansaction    : PA1
      Group          : XCU
      PROGram        : PFD199
      .
      .
      .
      .
      .
  + TAskreq        : PA1

Unfortunately this effective change of transaction-id was first
detected when CA-ACF2 produced an SECV abend every time
a user pressed PA1 - quite a problem in our installation as PA1
is used to display the main menu for initial access to all
applications running in our main CICS region.

Of course, the problem was easy enough to fix but very easy to
overlook.
