Using a 1K DSA page size

In June 1989, we installed a new application system into our
production CICS.  Prior to the installation, we had been
experiencing one program compression every day or so.  After
the installation, our program compression rate went up to 25 or
so a day.  I knew that some third-party software packages had a
1K DSA page size option, so I started looking at CICS
programs and macros.  After looking at the DFHSIT macro, I
discovered I could have a 1K DSA page size.  The DFHSIT
macro checks for a documented 2K and 4K page size.  It also
checks for an undocumented 8K and 16K page size.  By
dropping the check for a 16K page size and adding a check for
a 1K page size, you can run CICS with a 1K page size.
Change the following:

        DFHPRMCK  PGSIZE,&PGSIZE,&CSECT,S,,,2048,4096,8192,16384      *26800000

to:

        DFHPRMCK  PGSIZE,&PGSIZE,&CSECT,S,,,1024,2048,4096,8192       *26800000

Re-assemble your SIT with PGSIZE=1024 and bring up your
CICS system.

Installations that would like to install this modification with
SMP/E should use the following:

++ USERMOD(TS00001)   /* CHANGE PAGE SIZE */ .
++ VER (C150) PRE(UP69224,UP70261,UP75631,UP76321)
              FMID(HCI1703).
++ MACUPD (DFHSIT) DISTLIB(MACLIB).
./ CHANGE NAME=DFHSIT
        DFHPRMCK  PGSIZE,&PGSIZE,&CSECT,S,,,1024,2048,4096,8192       *26800000

Be sure to check your pre-requisites.

Once we implemented the change, our program compressions
dropped from 25 a day to 12 a day.
