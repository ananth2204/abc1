U0519 abend in a CICS region

Under certain circumstances the COBOL compiler will include
code to issue the user abend U0519 (related to missing STOP
RUN/GOBACK statements).  In a CICS environment, this will
bring down your CICS system unless you intercept the abend
via an entry in the System Recovery Table (SRT) and abend
the transaction as an ASRB.  The SRT should look something
like this:

         DFHSRT TYPE=USER,                                             X
               ABCODE=(203,            COBOL divide by zero            X
               519),                   COBOL user abend                X
               ROUTINE=DFHSRTRR
