 Multiple operator-ids in ADR/VOLLIE
Our development staff use ADR/VOLLIE for writing programs under CICS; the
current release of ADR/VOLLIE is 4.2.  As we work for several departments in our
company, we felt the need to create account records for every department
separately.  The operator-id is our key field for accounting.  This involved
creating different VOLLIE libraries on which the programs for the different
departments were stored.  The only way to access these programs was to sign on
to CICS with a user-id which had an operator-id defined in the sign-on table
with access to that particular library.
A disadvantage of this method was that every time a developer wanted to switch,
he had to:
%    Type TOFFU to exit VOLLIE
%    Type TCSSNU for a new sign-on
%    Type a new user-id and password
%    Type TOLLEU to enter VOLLIE again.
Also, he had to remember all his user-ids and passwords!
I found out that there was an undocumented parameter in the VOLLIE macro, called
OFFEXIT.  The format of this parameter is:
      OFFEXIT=(xxxx,pppppppp)
where xxxx  is XCTL or LINK and pppppppp is the program name to which control is
given after the OFF command.
The solution was there!  I wrote the program AUTD518, which stores a new
operator-id in the TCTUA field; this program is executed in the VOICE procedure
%ACSEL via a CALL command, after selecting for which department the developer
wants to work.  After the OFF command, control is given to program AUTD519.
This program determines whether the VOICE procedure %ACSEL was executed and, if
this is so, control is given to VOLLIE again with a new operator-id.
With this operator-id, the developer has access to the programs of the
department he selected without a new CICS sign-on, and all account records are
created for that department.
