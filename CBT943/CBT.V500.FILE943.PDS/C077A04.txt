Annual award winners

All the votes are now in for the 1991 CICS Update article of
the year awards.

The article that saved readers' installations most money was
Switching between transactions by Lawrence Holder (March
1991). On average, this article saved all subscribers who sent
in a voting paper just over $171 each - that's equivalent to a
total saving of over $500,000 for our total circulation.

The article that saved readers most time was judged to be
Speed up those CICS compiles by James E Holler. The average
time saved by all those who returned voting papers was 5.33
hour each - equivalent to a total saving of 16,000 man hours
for all the installations who subscribe to CICS Update.

CICS Update saves the average site $2561 and just under 100
hours a year. June's issue saved readers most money (an
average saving of almost $350). It also saved them most time
(12.13 hours on average).


The purpose of these awards, which were introduced in 1989,
is twofold - to give public recognition to the authors and to
enable us to tailor CICS Update more accurately to the needs of
our subscribers by concentrating more on the types of article
you have indicated are of most benefit to your installations.

If you feel that you could contribute an article but are unsure of
how to go about it, please contact the editor, Steve Piggott,
through any of the addresses shown on page 2 for a free copy
of ourNotes for contributors.

We extend our congratulations to Lawrence Holder and James
Holler - your $2000 prizes are on their way to you now. Our
thanks go to all our readers who took the trouble to vote.
