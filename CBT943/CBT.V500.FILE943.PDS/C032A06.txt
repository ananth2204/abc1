 Using CRLP under CICS
The Card Reader/Line Printer (CRLP) combination can be used to simulate terminal
I/O and is a very convenient way of executing things automatically under CICS.
For instance I use CRLP to disable a program or transaction temporarily without
having to recompile my PPT or remember to disable it every day.
To define a CRLP terminal type, add the following code to your TCT and re-
assemble it:
         DFHTCT TYPE=SDSCI,                                            X
               DSCNAME=READER,                                         X
               DEVICE=254/,                                            X
               DEVADDR=SYSIPT
         DFHTCT TYPE=SDSCI,                                            X
               DSCNAME=PRINTER,                                        X
               DEVICE=14/3,                                            X
               DEVADDR=SYSLST
         DFHTCT TYPE=LINE,                                             X
               ACCMETH=BSAM,                                           X
               INAREAL=8/,                                             X
               TRMTYPE=CRLP,                                           X
               ISADSCN=READER,                                         X
               OSADSCN=PRINTER
         DFHTCT TYPE=TERMINAL,                                         X
               TRMSTAT=TRANSCEIVE,                                     X
               TRMIDNT=SAMA,                                           X
               TRMPRTY=/,                                              X
               TRMTYPE=CRLP
Under CICS 1.5, you must add to your SIT:
     TCP=S$,ZCP=S$
Under CICS 1.6, I found out by accident that 3$ is good enough for TCP and ZCP.
In your CICS start-up JCL, after the $END card which signifies the end of your
SIT overrides, add the transactions that you want executed with XTE0U or T\U
after each transaction as follows:
     // EXEC DFHSIP,SIZE=nnnnK
     SIT=V3
     $END
     CSMT DISAB,TRNACT,SIN,TRANID=xxxx   \
     CSMT TERMNL,SIN,REC,TERMID=SAMA     \
     /*
You will find the replies to all your transactions on SYSLST when CICS is taken
down or you can examine the reply while CICS is active if you have segmented
SYSLST output.  With a bit of imagination you can do some incredible things with
this facility.
