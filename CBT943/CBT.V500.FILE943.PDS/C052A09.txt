Reader's letter

This is a response to the article THE MONITOR FOR CICS -
data collection, which appeared in Issue 50 of CICS Update.
We too have THE MONITOR FOR CICS installed, in CICS
1.7 and 2.1 regions, running under MVS/ESA.  We
successfully manage to dump and re-initialise the data
collection file without having either to stop and start the
collection file manually or using option 1.1 from the main
TMON menu.  The method we employ is for OPC/A to submit
a batch job automatically, immediately after midnight.  This
job issues a modify command to the CICS region to close THE
MONITOR file like this:

    // F CICS,TMONFILE=C

This job will also dump the collection file to a GDG.  On
successful completion of the above job, OPC/A will submit
another job to open the collection file like this:

    // F CICS,TMONFILE=O

This is all performed automatically without any operator
intervention and without the need for any new CICS programs.
