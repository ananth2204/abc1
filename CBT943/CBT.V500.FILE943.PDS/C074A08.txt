COBOL message IKF992I issued by CICS

CICS Update readers may be interested in the following
scenario.

Let us consider the case where CICS COBOL program A calls
COBOL subroutine B (static call), which in turn calls COBOL
subroutine C (static call).  If program C abends, the next
invocation of program A that attempts to use subroutine B will
result in the IKF992I message.

A flag in a COBOL control block used to detect recursion is
left on by the previous user as the routine failed.  To recover
from the situation, program A must be reloaded using the
CEMT NEWCOPY command.

For further information, review the IBM APAR PL71507,
which incidentally includes the useful comment "OS/VS
COBOL was never written with CICS in mind."
