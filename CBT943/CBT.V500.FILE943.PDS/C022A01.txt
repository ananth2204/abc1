Automatically switching dump files

A useful idea appeared in issue 12 of CICS Update (November 1986).  It was the
first article in that issue and was entitled The automatic switching of dump
files by Fran ois Mortier of Atlas Copco Airpower NV of Belgium.  We have now
implemented that idea in our system but have expanded on it.

The shortcoming in Mr Mortier's idea is that although he sets DFHDMPA to switch
automatically, he omits to do the same for DFHDMPB.  The consequences of this
are that after the automatic switching, if DFHDMPB becomes full, CICS will still
abend.

A good systems programmer will obviously do everything in his or her power to
prevent transactions abending and producing dumps, but we consider our first
priority to keep CICS going as long as possible for the benefit of the large
majority of our users.  What we have therefore decided to do is to force both
dump files to switch automatically.  The risk is, of course, that we will
overwrite dumps which have not yet been investigated, but we consider this a
risk worth taking as we find that they do not usually help very much in the
solving of problems and can, in most cases, be recreated in a test environment
if the need arises.

Our version of the program, which must be included in the PLTPI, was written in
Assembler and is as follows.

SWITCH   CSECT
******   SET DFHDMPA TO AUTOMATIC   ******
         EXEC  CICS LINK                                             *
               PROGRAM('DFHEMTP')                                    *
               COMMAREA(SETAUTO)                                     *
               LENGTH(13)
******   SWITCH TO DFHDMPB  *******
         EXEC  CICS LINK                                             *
               PROGRAM('DFHEMTP')                                    *
               COMMAREA(SETSWIT)                                     *
               LENGTH(13)
******   SET DFHDMPB TO AUTOMATIC   *******
         EXEC  CICS LINK                                             *
               PROGRAM('DFHEMTP')                                    *
               COMMAREA(SETAUTO)                                     *
               LENGTH(13)
******   SWITCH BACK TO DFHDMPA   ******
         EXEC  CICS LINK                                             *
               PROGRAM('DFHEMTP')                                    *
               COMMAREA(SETSWIT)                                     *
               LENGTH(13)
         EXEC  CICS RETURN
SETAUTO  DC    C'SET DUMP AUTO'
SETSWIT  DC    C'SET DUMP SWIT'
         END
