Cold starting sequential terminals

It is not possible to specify TCT=(xx,COLD) in the SIT.
Therefore you cannot perform a cold start on the TCT when
starting CICS with the AUTO option (EMER or WARM).
This causes a problem when using sequential terminals (ie card
reader/line printer terminals).  After a warm start, the input
specified for a sequential terminal will not be read in again and
the associated transaction will not be run.  The only way to get
the transaction processed  is to cold start CICS, which is not
what we want.

Another way might be to re-assemble the TCT changing the
name of the sequential terminal.  This method is not altogether
satisfactory.

Our solution is much easier to implement.  We delete the
record for the sequential terminal from the restart dataset.  The
22-byte key of the record is as follows:

    DC    X'0F'
    DC    C'TCP'
    DC    X'0000'
    DC    CL16'xxxx'

where xxxx is the terminal-id of the sequential terminal.

Our environment consists of MVS/XA 2.1.7 and CICS 1.7.
