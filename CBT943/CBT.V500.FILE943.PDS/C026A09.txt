 CICS message routing - further comments
The article CICS message routing (CICS Update, June 1987) suggests using the
CICS command SEND CONTROL after the CICS command SEND TEXT, to allow for cursor
positioning.  However, the SEND TEXT command itself allows for the sending of
additional options to the terminal.  It would be more efficient for the program
to include with the SEND TEXT command the ALARM, CURSOR, and FREEKB options.
Thus the SEND TEXT command would be as follows:
     EXEC CICS
          SEND TEXT
              FROM   (TEXT-DATA)
               LENGTH (TEXT-LENGTH)
               CURSOR (CUR-POSITION)
               ALARM
               FREEKB
               WAIT     other options as needed
             END-EXEC.
This would improve efficiency since an extra CICS command would not have to be
executed.
