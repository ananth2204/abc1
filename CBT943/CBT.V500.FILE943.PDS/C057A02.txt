CICS shut-down checklist

Debugging CICS abends, which occur when performing a
controlled shut-down, can sometimes be a long and tedious
process.  To assist in determining the cause of the abend, I
have developed a checklist which shows the sequence of
events, console messages, and internal flags in the order in
which they are performed.  I have found this to be more helpful
than the list provided by IBM in the Problem Determination
Guide.  This list is applicable to MVS CICS 1.7 sites.
