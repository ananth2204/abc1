 Restoring DFHCOMMAREA

A number of months ago, we stumbled across a peculiarity related to restoring
DFHCOMMAREA data.  The problem is associated with programs which interrupt a
pseudo-conversational transaction.  When the interrupting transaction executes,
it intercepts the DFHCOMMAREA being passed between executions of the pseudo-
conversational transaction.  The trick comes in getting it restored so that the
pseudo-conversational transaction will find the data in the COMMAREA when it
starts up again.

There are a couple of ways to do this.  One way is to execute a series of
service reload statements for the TCA, CSA, TCTTE etc.  Another way is to have a
routine go out and find the next transaction-id in the TCT so it can be used in
the CICS RETURN command.

We found that both of these methods can be bypassed.  While CICS will not allow
a RETURN statement to be executed without a transaction-id, it will allow a
transaction-id of low values to be used.  In fact, if low values are used in the
RETURN statement along with the COMMAREA clause, CICS will ignore the
transaction code, thus leaving the pseudo-conversational transaction-id, which
is still in the TCT, alone.  Furthermore, it will set up the COMMAREA with the
data.  This effectively restores the DFHCOMMAREA information without requiring
the service reloads or some routine to retrieve the next transaction-id from the
TCT.
