 ReaderUs letter
I have read the article An undocumented INVREQ under 1.6.1 by Michael Rosenberg
on page 43 of the March 1988 issue of CICS Update.  We had the same problem
described by Mr Rosenberg, but in 1985 and under the 1.6.0 version of CICS.  We
received the recommendation to apply APAR PP29876 in response to our problem
being reported.  This meant us applying quite a lot of related APARs, both pre-
requisite and post-requisite.
I should think that there is now a PTF from IBM that  fixes this problem.  Mr
Rosenberg didnUt say under which operating system his CICS system is running but
when I applied the APAR mentioned above for VSE there was also the APAR PP19073,
which was the OS/VS equivalent.
