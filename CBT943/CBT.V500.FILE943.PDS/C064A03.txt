Invalid transaction-ids

The article Starting a CICS transaction from a clear screen in
CICS Update June 1990 suggested a method of avoiding the
DFH2001I invalid transaction message.  However, that method
only allows for a transaction-id of blanks.  If a user enters an
unknown transaction-id, he/she is confronted with exactly the
same message.  There is a simple way of avoiding the
DFH2001I message completely if required.

Whenever an invalid (or disabled) CICS transaction-id is
entered, CICS generates the CSAC abnormal condition
transaction in its place.  This transaction invokes program
DFHACP (the abnormal condition program), which will
generate the DFH2001I message.

To avoid this, all that is required is to redefine transaction
CSAC to point to a user program.  Transaction CSAC resides
in the PCT group STANDARD and the RDO group
DFHSTAND.

This user program could, of course, be written in any
programming language supported by CICS.  The program
could, if required, display a useful informative message by
analysing the contents of the TCA (system area) field
TCAKCOID (offset X'B0' in CICS/MVS 2.1.1), which
contains the originally entered invalid or disabled transaction-
id.  Note that EIBTRNID will contain 'CSAC'.

To (re)define the CSAC transaction and its associated program,
the following could be used:

1  With PCT/PPT macros:

   CSAC     DFHPCT TYPE=ENTRY,TRANSID=CSAC,PROGRAM=USERACP
   USERACP  DFHPPT TYPE=ENTRY,PROGRAM=USERACP,PGMLANG=ASSEMBLER

2  With CICS RDO:
   Transaction Q> TRansaction    : CSAC
         Entry     Group          : USRSTAND
                   PROGram        : USERACP
                   TWasize        : 0
                   etc.

       Program Q> PROGram        : USERACP
         Entry     Group          : USRSTAND
                   Language       : Assembler
                   etc.

The program name and language may be of your own
choosing.

Other programs using DFHACP will not be affected, as they
will XCTL or LINK to it, and the CSAC transaction is not used
for any other purpose (to my knowledge).

This method also has advantages in that it may be easily turned
on or off (if you use RDO) and that it is entirely independent of
the CICS release.  I have used it successfully up to CICS/MVS
2.1.1.
