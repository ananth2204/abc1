 An undocumented INVREQ under 1.6.1
Having seen the same problem arise in four similar situations, I felt that this
was more than a coincidence, and that other CICS users should be made aware of
it.
It seems that on a file control READ or STARTBR, with the KEYLENGTH option
specified equal to 3 or less, and the actual key equal to the same length,
GENERIC is also assumed.  This will cause an invalid request, because in CICS if
your KEYLENGTH option is equal to or greater than the actual length of the key,
and you are also using the GENERIC option, an INVREQ will occur even in normal
situations.
This was proven by three separate groups within our company that recently went
from Release 1.5 to 1.6.1.  The keylengths were equal to 3, 3, 2, and 3.  To
find the maximum length that would cause this condition, I asked one of our
contractors to change the keylength from 3 to 4 and then to 5.  With a keylength
of 4 and 5 the command worked as required.
You can fix this problem by removing the KEYLENGTH option on non-generic reads
and STARTBRs for keylengths of 3 or less.
