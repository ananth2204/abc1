 Communicating by temporary storage

If your installation is currently in the midst of a macro-level to command-level
conversion, you may find the need for macro-level and command-level programs to
communicate through temporary storage.  The chances are, the macro-level
programs at this point are doing DFHTS TYPE=PUT and DFHTS TYPE=GET processing.
This will not work in communicating with command-level programs because these
commands read and write a single unit or logical record, while command-level
programs read and write to queues or message sets.  Figure 1 will help to
illustrate this.

The best way to resolve this problem is to change the PUTs and GETs in your
macro-level programs to PUTQs and GETQs.  Most likely you will be reading and
writing one message set at a time, so you can use a value of 1 in the ENTRY
option of the macro-level commands.  With this simple modification, your macro-
level programs will be reading and writing to queues in the same way as command-
level programs.  Figure 2 shows an example of this.
