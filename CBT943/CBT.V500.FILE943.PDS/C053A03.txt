Annual award winners

All the votes are now in for the 1989 CICS Update article of
the year awards.

The article that saved readers' installations most money was
judged to be Performance problems and the CICS dispatcher,
by Jamil El-Imad (February 1989).  The average sum saved by
all subscribers who sent in a voting slip was $300 each - that's
equivalent to a total saving of just over a million dollars for our
combined readership.

The article that saved readers most time was judged to be
TSO/ISPF CICS dump dataset utility, by B Perryman
(September - October 1989).  On average, this article saved all
subscribers who sent in a voting slip 1.87 hours each -
equivalent to a total saving of nearly 6500 hours for our
combined readership.

CICS Update saves the average subscriber's installation
$3637.50 and 51.6 hours a year.  September's issue saved
readers most money (an average saving of $575.77) and also
saved them most time (an average saving of 5.5 hours).

The reasons for instigating these awards have been twofold - to
give public recognition to these authors and to enable us to
tailor CICS Update more accurately to the needs of our
subscribers by concentrating more on the types of article that
you have indicated are of most benefit to your installations.

We have been greatly encouraged by the response to these
awards and will be repeating them for 1990 articles.  If you
feel that you could contribute an article but are unsure of how
to go about it, please contact the editor, Steve Piggott, through
any of the addresses shown on page 2 for a free copy of our
Notes for contributors.

We extend our congratulations to Mr El-Imad and Mr
Perryman - the $2000 prizes are on their way to you now.  Our
thanks also to all readers who took the trouble to vote.
