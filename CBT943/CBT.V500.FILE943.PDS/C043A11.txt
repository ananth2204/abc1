Reader's letter
I would like to point out a line of code that was missing from a
program published in the February 1989 issue of CICS Update.
The article is entitled CICS looping task detection and it starts on
page 23.  The missing line is indicated below.  With this line
missing, the program will appear to work as it is supposed to, but
will not detect all duplicate task numbers.
    COMPR2   CP    0(3,R5),0(3,R8)  ARE THEY EQUAL?
             .
             .
             .
             BE    ITSOK          NO DUPS FOUND
>>>          B     COMPR2         GO BACK AND COMPARE AGAIN <<< new line
    BR5      AH    R5,=H'3'       INCREMENT R5
    BR8      AH    R8,=H'3'       INCREMENT R8
