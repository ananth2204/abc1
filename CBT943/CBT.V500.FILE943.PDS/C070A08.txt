CICS transaction inquiries

We run an IBM 3090 with fifteen production and seven
development CICS 1.7 regions in three separate MRO
complexes, under MVS/XA 2.2.  We have three CSD files:
one for development, one for production, and one for test.
These files are quite large - the production file holds about
22,000 records.

The method used to determine information about a transaction
consisted of performing a CEDA exp gro(*) tran (xxxx)
command (where xxxx is the transaction-id) and looking at the
relevant entries in the CSD file.  This always took an excessive
amount of time because of the size of the files and the amount
of I/O that occurred.

There are two other ways of obtaining information about
transactions.  One is to write a transaction that simply does an
EXEC CICS INQUIRE TRANSACTION (xxxx) and writes the
results to a screen.  The other is to use CECI INQ
TRAN(xxxx) in the Terminal Owning Region, if you wish to
know where the transaction executes, or in the Application
Owning Region, if you want other information.

While these findings may be widely known, there are probably
many others out there who spend a lot of time waiting for
CEDA to browse the CSD file, just like we used to.
