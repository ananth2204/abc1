 Easier CICS sign-on

In a TSO environment, many of our users found themselves logging in and out of
various versions of CICS and TSO during the course of a working day.  After the
second or third time, the novelty of clearing the screen, entering CSSN, filling
in their name and password, and pressing enter wore thin.  This modification of
the good morning message module, DFHGMMOD, was created to help remove a few
unnecessary key strokes and to provide a site-specific logo at the same time.
The entire change consists of the addition of two lines of code at the label
CSGMM32A and a change to the CICS/VS logo at label CSGMCICS.

The first line places a hidden log-on for CSSN in the upper left-hand corner of
the screen and positions the cursor at the beginning of the line.  The second
line moves the welcome message far enough to the right to allow the user to key
in a numerical terminal log-on (9999), including his password and name, if he so
wishes.  Finally, the CICS logo may be modified as desired to indicate which
CICS system the user is in.  We have three CICS regions - production, program
development, and testing - each with its respective logo.  The modified module
is re-assembled and linked to a particular load library in the DFHRPL list, the
sequence of concatenation in the JCL for that CICS system determining which
message appears on which CICS system.  The original DFHGMMOD module is re-named
in the CICS LOADLIB to prevent it from being found first.

When the user enters the log-on command for a particular CICS, the good morning
module for that system is found and displayed.  At this point, there are three
options available:

1    Press enter to invoke the hidden CSSN transaction and sign on in the normal
way.

2    Since the cursor is positioned in the upper left-hand corner of the screen,
immediately sign on using the 9999 numerical sign-on transaction, including
password and name.  Since the attribute of the CSSN transaction-id is dark, all
letters typed in will be hidden, thus protecting the password from being
displayed.

3    Clear the screen and enter whatever transaction-ids may be invoked without
signing on.
