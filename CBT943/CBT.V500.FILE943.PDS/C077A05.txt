Cross-reference listing of CSD - for MVS

Although Frank Braman's article A cross-reference listing of
the CSD file in the November 1991 issue of CICS Update
proved very useful as we are just converting to RDO, I did
have some teething problems with running the code in an
MVS/XA environment. To overcome these problems the
following changes were made:

1      Obviously the SELECTIASSIGN statements needed to be
      changed to OS standards.

2      RECORDING MODE F was changed to RECORDING
      MODE V on the IN-FILE definition. Yes, the SYSPRINT
      output from MVS DFHCSDUP is LRECL=125 and
      RECFM=VBA.

3      A working storage area identical to the SORT-FILE record
      definition was defined like this:

      01    WS-WORK-REC.
            05  WS-WORK-ELEMENT        PIC X(8).
            05  WS-WORK-OWNER          PIC X(8).
            05  WS-WORK-OWNER-TYPE     PIC X(5).
            05  WS-WORK-TYPE           PIC X(10).

      Then every reference to the constituent fields of the SORT-
      REC (ELEMENT, SORT-OWNER, SORT-OWNER-
      TYPE, and SORT-TYPE) within the SORT-INPUT
      SECTION of the program was changed to the
      corresponding newly defined WS-WORK-REC fields. The
      reason for this is that any of the references to fields within
      SORT-REC in the SORT-INPUT SECTION will produce
      an 0C4 as this area is not addressable until the SORT-FILE
      is open, which is, of course, not until it is referenced in the
      sorting section.

4      Lastly, the test for end of usable data in the 080-READ
      paragraph, namely:

      IF IDENT = '1S55I LAST'
      should be changed to:
      IF IDENT = 'DFH5101 I L'
      since the 1S55I literal does not exist in the MVS
      DFHCSDUP listing.

I hope I'm not teaching my grandmother to suck eggs, but merely
saving other readers some time and effort in using what has
proven to be a very useful program.
