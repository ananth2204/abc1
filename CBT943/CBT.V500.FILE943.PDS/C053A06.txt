CEDF ZAP to continue session - an update

Tony Dean's article in the November 1989 issue of CICS
Update describes a method of improving CEDF's usability by
implementing three ZAPs.  We have VSE/SP 3.2.0 with CICS
1.7 running and have tried to apply these ZAPs.

Unfortunately, we received the message 'Verifications do not
match'.  After further investigation we have discovered that the
relevant offsets for our installation are as follows:
%      For setting 'Cont=Yes' the correct offset should be 0378.
%      For changing 'Stop=Yes' to 'Stop=No' the correct offset
       should be 037C.
%      For leaving 'Cont=Yes' the correct offset should be 02F8.

May I take this opportunity of expressing my thanks to Tony
for a good idea.
