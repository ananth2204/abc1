A program to issue AR commands from CICS


INTRODUCTION

The following short program has proved to be extremely useful
in issuing AR commands from CICS by utilizing an
undocumented SVC (SVC 30).  In this particular
implementation it is used to issue a VTAM command to
display the status of a line every hour to verify that the line is
up.  Entries are required in the PCT, PPT, and PLTPI.
