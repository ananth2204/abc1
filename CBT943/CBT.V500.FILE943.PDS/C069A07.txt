CICS AUTOMATION OPTION/MVS

CICS Automation Option/MVS is a new product designed to
work with AOC/MVS (or the ACO SolutionPac) and NetView
to provide users with automated operations management from a
single control point.  Multiple CICS regions can be monitored
and controlled from one NetView terminal.  The product can
also be used to automate CICS start-up, shutdown, and error
recovery, and to assist in problem determination.


CICSVR MVS/ESA VERSION 2

Version 2 of CICSVR MVS/ESA provides support for the
'backup while open' facility introduced in DFP 3.2 and
implemented in CICS/ESA 3.2.1 (see below).  Also
incorporated in this latest release are a new 'protection against
backout failure' function, which uses new information in the
CICS/ESA log to back-out failed updates off-line, and
extended sequence checking to minimize operator errors in
recovering datasets.


CICS/ESA VERSION 3.2.1

This latest modification release of CICS/ESA incorporates the
support required for CICS Automation Option/MVS and
CICSVR MVS/ESA Version 2 (see above).  In addition,
CICS/ESA 3.2.1 uses the cross-system coupling facility of
MVS/ESA Version 4 to improve CICS XRF support and
enables CICS operator functions to be invoked from an MVS
TSO console.  A new transaction, CMAC, is introduced,
providing the user with on-line access to CICS messages and codes.
