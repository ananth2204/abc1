More about ISC, APPC, and LU6.2 sessions

Following the publication of my article ISC, APPC, and LU6.2
sessions in CICS in the December 1989 issue of CICS Update I
would like to add the following comment.

We had one problem with ISC that should be noted.  After the
generation of the TCP (as described in my article), the PA1 key
and CEDF would not function on local SNA terminals.  The
user would be forced off the session and a PROG418 message
would appear.

After some research we discovered that the TCP does not, in
fact, need to be re-generated - LU6.2 support is supplied as a
default.  Therefore, all that needs to be done is to use ZCP=S$
in the SIT definition.  The ISC program described in the article
did need to be re-generated.  After re-generation, we moved
ISC module DFHASV into an APF-authorised library.
Everything now seems to be running fine.
