The CICS System Definition file

I was surprised to discover, after talking to several CICS
system programmers, that there are still a significant number of
sites not using the Resource Definition On-line (RDO) facility.
RDO allows resource definitions for the PCT, PPT, TCT, and
FCT to be created and amended interactively (FCT definitions
can only be controlled by RDO if you have CICS Version 3).
The following resources can be controlled using RDO:

o      Transactions

o      Programs

o      Mapsets for BMS

o      Partition sets for BMS

o      VTAM terminals

o      MVS consoles

o      MRO

o      ISC links and sessions using LUTYPE 6.1 and 6.2.

Every resource that is defined to CICS using the RDO facility
is stored in a special file known as the CICS System Definition
(CSD) file. The CSD file is a VSAM dataset, and a single CSD
can be shared by several CICS systems. You could use separate
CSDs; however, this is not advisable as this would cause an
administration overhead because they would have to be updated
individually every time a resource was added or amended.

CSD records are created on-line using the CEDA transaction.
This supplied transaction is documented in the CICS manual,
Resource Definition Online. The CSD file has a special record
structure. Resource definitions that are stored in the CSD must
be members of  GROUP structures. GROUPs may be members
of LIST structures, although this is not mandatory.

The supplied IBM transactions are CEDA, CEDB, and CEDC.
These can be used to manipulate CSD entries. CEDA can be
used to define, install, and view CSD entries. CEDB can only
be used to define and view CSD entries. CEDC is very limited
in functionality and can only be used to view CSD entries.
These transactions interface with the RDO language to
manipulate the CSD structures.

The DFHCSDUP program is used to interface to RDO in
batch. There are a number of commands that can be issued in
batch that cannot be issued on-line. The main RDO commands
are as follows:

o      INITIALIZE - Initializes a CSD file and creates standard
      IBM-supplied resource definitions.

o      LIST - Lists resource definitions.

o      MIGRATE - Converts macro definitions from a CICS load
      library into CSD format records.

o      SERVICE - Used to perform maintenance on the CSD.

o      UPGRADE - Creates CSD definitions after a new version
      of CICS has been installed.

o      VERIFY - Used to remove locks which can occur after
      abnormal termination.

The RDO environment can be set up by performing the
following functions. The following job can be used to define
the VSAM cluster that will act as your CSD. Space
requirements will vary depending on the size of your CICS
tables. IBM supplies information in the CICS Installations and
Operation Guide on how to estimate the space requirements.

After the physical CSD has been created it has to be initialized
with IBM-supplied resources. The following job can be used to
initialize the CSD and then list its contents. This job uses the
DFHCSDUP program. All of the IBM-supplied GROUPs
contained in the CSD will begin with the letters 'DFH'.

Once the CSD set-up has been completed you should add FCT
entries to your CICS systems for the CSD file. We run six
CICS regions at our site and share one CSD between all these
regions. Below are the sample FCT entries. FCTCSD1 is
defined to our CICS region. You can browse and update CSD
entries from this region. FCTCSD2 is used for all the other
CICS regions. This FCT only allows browse access to the
CSD. The reason for this kind of set-up is to ensure that only
one system can update the CSD at any one time. The set-up
that we have in place is only one type of configuration
possible.

FCTCSD1  DFHFCT TYPE=DATASET,                                          X
               DATASET=DFHCSD,                                         X
               ACCMETH=(VSAM),                                         X
               BUFND=3,                                                X
               BUFNI=2,                                                X
               RECFORM=(VARIABLE,RECORD),                              X
               SERVREQ=(READ,UPDATE,ADD,BROWSE,DELETE),                X
               STRNO=2

FCTCSD2  DFHFCT TYPE=DATASET,                                          X
               DATASET=DFHCSD,                                         X
               BUFND=3,                                                X
               BUFNI=2,                                                X
               RECFORM=(VARIABLE,RECORD),                              X
               SERVREQ=(READ,BROWSE),                                  X
               STRNO=2

You should then add the GRPLIST keyword to your SIT by
pointing to the list you want to use when CICS is started. For
VTAM users this will be DFHLIST2. You can change this if
required when you build lists of your own. We have separate
lists for each of our systems. So in our CICSA SIT we code
GRPLIST=CICSAG.

Once initial definition has been completed you can perform
further customization if required. We decided to log any
commands that were issued relating to RDO. To achieve this I
created DCT entries for CADL and CSDL as follows:

         DFHDCT TYPE=INDIRECT,DESTID=CADL,INDDEST=CSSL
         DFHDCT TYPE=INDIRECT,DESTID=CSDL,INDDEST=CSSL

CADL is a log of VTAM resources that are installed in the
active CICS system. It records deletions and the installation of
TCT entries. CSDL provides a log of all RDO commands that
affect the CSD. You can use these files in back-up and
recovery situations.

The last thing to do is add the following JCL statement to your
CICS start-up procedure:

//DFHCSD   DD   DSN=CICS.CSD,DISP=SHR

This article has covered basic RDO set-up and concepts. It has
not covered detailed usage of RDO. For full details on how
RDO can be utilized you will need to reference a number of
CICS manuals. RDO has proved to be a very useful facility for
our installation and helps in the administration of our CICS
systems.
