 Task termination at CICS shut-down
If you run programs as endless tasks and want to bring them to a graceful end
you can do it by periodically checking a data area in DFHCSADS.  The following
lines of code are all that are needed:
     TM   CSASSI2,CSASTIM
     BO   ...your program termination routine...
CSASSI2 is the System Signal Indicator 2 and CSASTIM is the System Termination
Indicator Mask.
I employ this method in an endless task that scans the TCT. When the program was
running without it, the operators mentioned they had to use CSMT SHUT,Y instead
of CSMT SHUT,N to bring CICS down.  I put this piece of code in to execute each
time the TCT is scanned.  Now when the operators perform CSMT SHUT,N the program
will detect system termination, branch to end of job, and return, thus
eliminating any need to use CSMT SHUT,Y or to terminate a task manually.
