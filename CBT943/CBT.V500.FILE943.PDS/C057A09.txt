VTAM cancelling and bringing down CICS

We had a problem where, if VTAM fell over or was cancelled
by the operator, all the CICS partitions that were sitting under
VTAM would crash as well with the messages:

    DFH0606 - ABEND X'40' HAS BEEN DETECTED
    DFH3200I - DANGER KCP/TCP LIFO STORAGE OVERFLOW
    DFH0611 - ABNORMAL TERMINATION COMPLETE

We passed the problem over to IBM who passed it over to the
CICS development group about six months ago.  Some time
later I was reading the VSE/SP Version 3 Installation of Large
CICS Partitions GG24-3332-00 publication.  On page 9 I
discovered the following:

CATALOG USERCP2.PROC DATA=YES REPLACE=YES
* START MODE FOR BG-PARTITION IS NORMAL
     .
     .
     .
SET SDL
ISTAICIR,SVA                        VTAM MODULES  -- DO NOT DELETE THEM
ISTINCCO,SVA                        THEY AVOID THAT CICS IS CANCELLED
ISTAPCKU,SVA                        IF THE OPERATOR CANCELS VTAM
     etc

In other words, putting the modules ISTAICIR, ISTINCCO,
and ISTAPCKU in the SVA keeps my CICS systems from
crashing.

I immediately put them in and cancelled VTAM (in my test
system of course) and received the following messages from
CICS:

    DFH2305I TERMINATION OF VTAM SESSIONS BEGINNING
    DFH2316I - VTAM ACB IS CLOSED

I brought VTAM up again and after the message:

    5A20I VTAM INITIALIZATION COMPLETE

I entered:

    2 CEMT S VTA OPE

and after receiving the reply:

    VTA OPE NORMAL

I was miraculously able to continue working on my CICS
system.  Maybe IBM Customer Support should read their own
books.  They were surprised when I told them what had
happened.
