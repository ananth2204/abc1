Using VOLLIE as a monitor for batch

VOLLIE, or VOICE  to be more exact, is used at our installation
as a batch monitor.  It is used to keep an eye on the programmers
since they often decide to perform sequential runs on very large
databases, and consequently eat up all of our resources.

The following routine was written using VOLLIE 3.4 under CICS
1.6 and VSE 1.4.2, and works without change on VOLLIE 4.0
and VSE 2.1.5.

It is invoked every 15 minutes and checks whether a job has
worked for more than 10 minutes, has performed more than
20,000 I/Os, or has eaten up more than 180 CPU seconds.  If any
of these limits is broken it prints an appropriate message on the
console.

To run it use a CRLP terminal and after the $END or after your
other CRLP commands add the lines shown in the start-up JCL
below.  In addition add the following statement at the end of the
OLLESOP of the user that you choose to run the VOICE
procedure:
   @ EXEC CHKBAT
