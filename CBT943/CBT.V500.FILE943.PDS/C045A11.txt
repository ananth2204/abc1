CICS/ESA Version 3 Release 1

Although the content of IBM's announcement of CICS/ESA
Version 3 Release 1 holds few surprises, the speed with which it
has followed the October 1988 Statement of Direction for CICS
has taken everyone aback.  The final nail in the coffin for the
macro-level programming interface has not quite been hammered
home.  While PL/I and COBOL macro-level applications will be
things of the past, Assembler programs are permitted - IBM warns
that this will be the last release where this will be so.

IBM is heralding CICS/ESA 3.1 as a triumph for the 'Z'
specification language, its joint venture with Oxford University.
Customers will probably be a little more wary in accepting such a
claim but, if it is found to be justified, then IBM will have given
itself a good sound foundation for the future development of
CICS.

Support is included for the Database Control (DBCTL) facility of
IMS/ESA providing users with a release-independent interface
obviating the need for regenerating IMS when a new release of
CICS is installed and vice versa.  In addition, CICS users will be
able to process IMS Data Entry Databases (DEDBs) and to have
concurrent access to IMS databases from Batch Message
Processing (BMP) programs and from CICS.

Several of the frustrations and irritations of today's CICS systems
and applications programmers will be eased, if not removed
altogether, by the following facilities:

%   A new user-replaceable program to enable installations to
balance the workload in MRO or ISC environments
automatically.

%   RDO support for VSAM files and the Data Tables feature.

%   The ability to make upper-case translation dependent on the
transaction-id rather than the terminal-id.

%   Support for LU 6.2 transaction routing.

CICS/ESA 3.1 will run only under MVS/ESA and will be
generally available from June 1990.
