Variable length COMMAREA

In designing a flexible and modular application system, a
requirement frequently encountered is for a program to be
invoked from different places and passed different amounts of
data.

This situation is commonly handled by using a fixed length
DFHCOMMAREA with a defined layout and by moving
different parts of it to working storage based on a check of the
EIBCALEN field.  This approach is somewhat rigid and
doesn't lend itself easily to change.

A more flexible approach is to define the DFHCOMMAREA
as a variable length data field up to the maximum allowed by
CICS.  The layout of the DFHCOMMAREA field is not
mapped out in the linkage section.  The EIBCALEN field is
compared to the length of the receiving data areas in working
storage and the contents of DFHCOMMAREA moved to the
appropriate area.

The following code written in COBOL II illustrates this
approach:

LINKAGE SECTION.
01  DFHCOMMAREA.
    05 FILLER                         PIC X(01)
                                      OCCURS 1 TO 32767 TIMES
                                      DEPENDING ON EIBCALEN.
PROCEDURE DIVISION.
    EVALUATE EIBCALEN
       WHEN LENGTH OF WS-AREA-A
          MOVE DFHCOMMAREA TO WS-AREA-A
       WHEN LENGTH OF WS-AREA-B
          MOVE DFHCOMMAREA TO WS-AREA-B
       WHEN OTHER
          EXEC CICS
             RETURN
          END-EXEC
    END-EVALUATE.

The advantage of this approach is its flexibility.  A change in
the layout or length of the data passed to a program only
requires a re-compile with no change to the actual code.
