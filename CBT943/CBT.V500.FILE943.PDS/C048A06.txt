Sign-on changes for CICS 1.7 - a response

I would like to comment on the article, Sign-on changes for CICS
1.7, which appeared in the April 1989 issue.  The routine as
coded does the job assuming that register 2 is assigned as a base
register for DFHSNNT, otherwise the clearing of the fields will
actually take place in DFHSNNT.  When a sign-off is issued for a
terminal, CICS sets the terminal to ATI, sets the security key to a
value of 1, and puts a default SNTTE address in field
TCTTESNT.

Shown below is my version of the routine with the above items
fixed in the code.  This code is working in a VSE/SP CICS 1.7
environment.  The code to point to the default SNTTE entry was
obtained from A.DFHXSP, which is in the PRD2.GEN1 library.

** AT THIS POINT ALL SIGN-ON INFORMATION FROM THE USER HAS BEEN
*  VERIFIED. WE HAVE ENCRYPTED THE PASSWORD SO THAT IT CAN BE
*  COMPARED AGAINST THE PASSWORD IN DFHSNNT. WE HAVE ALSO CALLED
*  A ROUTINE THAT DOES A LOOKUP AGAINST DFHSNNT USING THE NAME
*  AND PASSWORD SUPPLIED BY THE USER. R2 WILL POINT TO THE ENTRY
** IN DFHSNNT.
