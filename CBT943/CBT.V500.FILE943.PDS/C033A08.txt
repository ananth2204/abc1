 CICS availability notification
INTRODUCTION
When working under TUBES, if you are using a different system, you will not know
that CICS has come up unless you are informed explicitly or you keep trying to
sign on every few seconds.
I wrote a VOICE procedure, ANNOUNCE, which works as soon as CICS comes up and
sends a message by machine-id or user-id to everyone to inform them that CICS
has come up and then turns itself off.  The program was written for VOLLIE 3.4
under CICS 1.6, VSE 1.4.2, and all versions of TUBES.  It works without change
on VOLLIE 4.0, CICS 1.6, and VSE 2.1.5.  Ensure that you give the VSE machine
authorisation within TUBES.
To run it, define a CRLP terminal and insert the following statements:
     CSSN NAME=........,PS=........     \
     OLLE                               \
     ...  other CRLP commands   ...     \
     CSMT TERMNL,SIN,REC,TERMID=SAMA    \
where \ is XTE0U and the CSSN is for the VOLLIE user whose OLLESOP has an @EXEC
ANNOUNCE command at the end of it.
