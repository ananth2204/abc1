Assigning significant names to transactions

The transaction name in CICS is limited to 4 bytes.  For the
end user, this sometimes means having to make a guess to
identify certain transactions and what they process.  Take for
example an extreme case at our installation where we identify
our main payroll transaction with the name XKPT.  End users
find this all a bit of a mystery and come to the conclusion that
only the EDP gurus really know the functions of all the
transaction-ids.

Fortunately, there is an exit from TCP where it is possible to
change the transaction name before task attach.  The exit name
is XTCATT.  For further details, refer to the CICS
Customization Guide, Chapters 5.1 and 5.2.  For areas, refer to
CICS Data Areas manual under TCA and TIOA.

The following Assembler program illustrates how this exit is
used at our installation:

XTCATT   START 0
         REGEQU
         COPY  DFHCSADS
         COPY  DFHTCADS
TCTTEAR  EQU   R2
         COPY  DFHTCTTE
TIOABAR  EQU   R4
         COPY  DFHTIOA
TCPEXIT  CSECT
         SAVE  (2,4)
         BALR  R7,0
         USING *,R7
         B     OPEN
         DC    C'-***** PROGRAM  - TCPEXIT  *****'
         DC    C'-***** VERSION  -   01.00  *****'
OPEN     EQU   *
         LA    6,TAB
LOOP     EQU   *
         CLC   TIOADBA(6),0(6)        TIOADBA = TERMINAL DATA
         BE    MOVE                             BEGINNING ADDRESS
         CLC   0(2,6),=XL2'FFFF'
         BE    RETURN
         LA    6,10(6)
         B     LOOP
MOVE     EQU   *
         MVC   TCAKCTI(4),6(6)        TCAKCTI = TASK NAME
RETURN   EQU   *
         RETURN (2,4)
         LTORG
TAB      DS    0CL22
         DC    CL10'CONTABFENU'
         DC    0CL10
         DC    CL5'FOLHA'              5 CHARACTER TRANSID
         DC    XL1'00'                 X'00' TO COMPLETE 6 CHARACTER
         DC    CL4'WELC'
         DC    XL2'FFFF'               END OF TAB
         END   TCPEXIT

Now, when the end user enters 'CONTAB' at his or her
terminal, the transaction FENU is started.  Similarly, when the
end user enters 'FOLHA', the transaction WELC is started,
and so on.

Don't use the long name name in any START/RETURN
TRANSID commands, only when invoking the transaction
from a terminal.  In the PCT, the restriction of 4 bytes remains.
To enable this exit, run the following Assembler program in
the PLTPI.

*ASM XOPTS(NOROLOG NOEPILOG)
DFHEISTG DSECT
EXTENAB  DFHEIENT CODEREG=7,DATAREG=6,EIBREG=9
         B     ABERTURA
         DC    C'-***** PROGRAM  - EXTENAB  *****'
         DC    C'-***** VERSION  -   01.00  *****'
ABERTURA EQU   *
         EXEC  CICS ENABLE PROGRAM('TCPEXIT') EXIT('XTCATT') START
         EXEC  CICS RETURN
         LTORG
         END   EXTENAB

Don't forget to catalogue the programs TCPEXIT and
EXTENAB in the PPT or RDO.
