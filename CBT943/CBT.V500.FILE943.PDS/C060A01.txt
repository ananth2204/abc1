Starting a CICS transaction from a clear screen

Paul Glynn wrote in the June 1990 issue of CICS Update that
when a user hits the ENTER key while a blank screen is
presented, CICS issues the DFH2001I message (invalid
transaction entered).  Then he describes how, by editing the
CSD dataset, he could invoke the default front-end MENU
transaction.  At the University of Calgary, we have been facing
the same problem.  Our solution involved a two-pronged
approach.

We needed to implement a system-wide standard that every
transaction would terminate with a transaction-id of MENU,
or, even better, would start the MENU transaction.  In case of
transaction abends, we decided to apply the second approach.

The problem was that after getting the 'transaction has
abended' message the user would usually press ENTER and,
you guessed it, would get the famous DFH2001I message
staring him straight in the face.  So the solution was based on
the fact that the message DFH2001I comes out of DFHACP -
the Abnormal Condition Program, which means that the user-
written DFHPEP (Program Error Program) could be used to
return the MENU transaction-id.

Here is a simplified version of our DFHPEP that will do the
trick.  We are using this program for solving some additional
problems but I will leave that for another article.

This program was tested with MVS/SP and MVS/XA under
CICS 1.7 and CICS 2.1.1.  Additional information about
writing a program error program can be found in the CICS
Customization Guide.
