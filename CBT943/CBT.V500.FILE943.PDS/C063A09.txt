Reader's letter

In Issue 55 (June 1990), Paul Glynn described a good method
of starting a CICS transaction from a clear screen.  I do a
similar thing, only a little easier.  After compiling the
DFHPCT macro with a single entry with the parameter
XTRANID=4040404040, I run a DFHCSDUP MIGRATE
batch job with the new phase to create a new group.  This
group can then be added to any CICS you like.  Be careful not
to touch the XTRANID field on-line with CEDA.
