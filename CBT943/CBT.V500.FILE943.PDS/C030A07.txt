 Extended attributes and remote viewing
Referring to the article by Mr Ernie Ishman in the December issue of CICS
Update, I would like to add some improvements.  We implemented the Tremote
screen viewingU facility.  It works perfectly, but there was one drawback.  If a
panel on an original terminal has used extended highlighting and/or extended
colour (blinking, reverse video etc) the RECEIVE command was not able to read
all the necessary attributes, and, as a result, the TaskingU terminal displayed
the panel without the extended attributes.
The terminal that supports the extended attributes can transmit the datastream
in one of three forms called the inbound reply mode.  Normally BMS requires an
inbound reply mode of TfieldU, but only an inbound reply mode of TextendedU
allows the RECEIVE command to build a full structured output datastream.
The following code should be inserted into the program GETSCRN2 to support
switching to proper mode.
*  SET REPLY INBOUND MODE TO EXTENDED
      EXEC CICS SEND FROM(BUFEXT) LENGTH(LEN) STRFIELD INVITE
      MVC   LENGTH,=AL2(4090)
      EXEC CICS RECEIVE ...

*  SET REPLY INBOUND MODE AGAIN TO FIELD
      EXEC CICS SEND FROM(BUFLD) LENGTH(LEN) STRFIELD LAST

*  DATA DEFINITIONS
LEN      DC    H'5'                     LENGTH OF MESSAGE
BUFEXT   DC    X'0005'                  LENGTH OF DATA
         DC    X'09'                    REPLY MODE INDICATOR
         DC    X'00'                    MUST BE ZERO
         DC    X'01'                    EXTENDED FIELD MODE INDICATOR
BUFLD    DC    X'0005'                  LENGTH OF DATA
         DC    X'09'                    REPLY MODE INDICATOR
         DC    X'00'                    MUST BE ZERO
         DC    X'00'                    FIELD MODE INDICATOR
