How to tell whether a transaction is local or remote

Within CICS there are two types of inter-communication:
Multi-Region Operation (MRO) and Inter-System
Communication (ISC).  Both make resources in one CICS
system available to other CICS systems.  This allows CICS to
engage in various forms of distributed processing.

Once you have CICS regions sharing resources (whether these
resources be files, queues, or transactions), each resource can
be either local or remote, depending on where they have been
accessed or invoked from.

It can often be beneficial for application programmers to be
able to determine whether an individual transaction, running in
a specific CICS region, has been invoked locally (ie from that
same CICS region) or remotely (ie transaction-routed from a
remote CICS region).   Each CICS region participating in inter-
communication needs a unique system identifier (SYSID, also
known as SYSIDNT).  However, if you pick up this SYSID in
an application program like this:

      05  WS-SYSID-EXECUTING                  PIC X(4).

      EXEC CICS
           ASSIGN SYSID (WS-SYSID-EXECUTING)
      END-EXEC.

you will always be returned the SYSID where that transaction
is executing.  In the case of a remote transaction, you will not
be given the SYSID of the CICS region that invoked that
transaction.

If, for example, you have a transaction that will be executed
both locally and remotely you may wish to determine which
way it was invoked and act accordingly, perhaps to write local
or remote temporary storage queues or function ship requests if
need be.  As we have seen, you cannot access the SYSID and
expect this to tell you from where that transaction was invoked.

However, it is possible to determine whether a transaction was
started remotely or locally by doing an INQUIRE on the CICS
terminal identifier like this:

      05  WS-REMOTESYSTEM                  PIC X(4).

      05  WS-REMOTE-START-IND              PIC X VALUE SPACE.
              88  STARTED-REMOTELY         VALUE 'R'.
              88  STARTED-LOCALLY          VALUE 'L'.

      EXEC CICS
           INQUIRE TERMINAL (EIBTRMID)
           REMOTESYSTEM     (WS-REMOTESYSTEM)
      END-EXEC.

      IF WS-REMOTESYSTEM = SPACES
               MOVE 'L' TO WS-REMOTE-START-IND
      ELSE  MOVE 'R' TO WS-REMOTE-START-IND.

In this example we do the necessary INQUIRE and specify that
the name of the REMOTESYSTEM is placed in the variable
WS-REMOTESYSTEM.  If WS-REMOTESYSTEM contains
blanks then we know that this transaction was invoked locally.
If it was invoked remotely then WS-REMOTESYSTEM will
contain the four character system identifier (SYSID) of that
remote system.   In this example we do not bother to see what
SYSID may be in WS-REMOTESYSTEM but simply set an
indicator that we can use later in the program to tell us whether
the transaction is local ('L') or remote ('R').
