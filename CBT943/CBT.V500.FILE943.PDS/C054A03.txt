DFHMSCAN - comments and improvements

Sometimes IBM offers useful facilities with the right hand and
takes them away with the left.  Such is the case with
DFHMSCAN and CICS 1.7, originally promised as an 'easy to
install' PTF.  The easy PTFs have all been cancelled and
DFHMSCAN is now only available as a level set PTF
(UL61061) with over 1000 PREREQs.  Why a batch program
has such a lot of PREREQs is a mystery, but when you have
worked with IBM software as long as I have mysteries are
commonplace.

Forget the level set, forget about installing CICS Version 2 just
to get DFHMSCAN - it is freely available from your friendly
IBM SE and comes in working order and with no PREREQs or
other encumbrances.  Show your SE the following:

%     Access TSINFO via UMIS or HONE
%     Select 'library search'
%     Search on the keyword DFHMSCAN
%     The source is called DFHMSCAN SOURCE
%     Copy it to tape for your grateful customer.

Your SE will also tell you that you accept it on an 'as is' basis,
which means you shouldn't report bugs in this version.  I found
this more than acceptable.  In reality, it is a one-off exercise
and a few quirks of coding can be tolerated.

One serious deficiency in the program is the inability to process
a PDS concatenation chain.  The original was designed to
process one load library at a time and we have hundreds.  Six
extra lines of code are all that are required to get around this
restriction.  Here they are:

Immediately after

P5       EQU   *

insert

         MVI   INPUT+X'1A',X'02'    FLIP DSORG TO PO

After

NEWBLOCK EQU   *
         GET   INPUT,DIRAREA

insert

         OC    DIRAREA,DIRAREA      ZERO DIRECTORY BLOCK
         BZ    NEWBLOCK             YES, GET ANOTHER

After

NEWNAME  EQU   *
         C     R4,ADBLKEND
         BNL   NEWBLOCK

insert

         CLC   XL8FF,0(R4)          END OF THIS DIRECTORY
         BE    NEWBLOCK             YES, GET ANOTHER BLOCK

Find the INPUT DCB and add the EODAD parameter like this:

INPUT    DCB   DSORG=PS,                                               X
               DDNAME=INPUT,                                           X
               BLKSIZE=256,                                            X
               RECFM=U,                                                X
               MACRF=(GM),                                             X
               EODAD=CLOSE

Now the INPUT DD can be a concatenation chain.
DFHMSCAN will treat the whole concatenation chain as one
PDS with no separation.  It wasn't worth the effort in a 'one-
off' exercise to add any more sophistication.

Some table entries are missing.  I've found two - no doubt
there are many more:

%     The ALT is missing from the list of tables at label
      CICSTNT, but I can't think why you would want to search
     it for macros.
%     An FCP call is missing.  Find the label CSAT0001 - a few
      lines down:
      after

         DC    X'2800',CL8'GETAREA '

      insert

         DC   X'2C00',CL8'GETAREA '

DFHMSCAN contains many quirks.  Once understood they
become trivial.  Don't let a few oddities detract from the
purpose of the program - ie to identify and quantify the effort
involved in a macro-level to command-level conversion.

%     DFHMSCAN frequently lies about the language a program
      is written in, sometimes because of subroutines of different
      languages being linked together.  Double check against the
      CICS definition if it matters.

%     DFHCHECK MACRO? frequently occurs.  This is just
     reporting the presence of return code checking within the
      previous macro.  You will observe the offset and absolute
      address rising in increments of 8 after the main macro.
      Ignore these.

%     The program length appears as zero for ignored modules (
     eg modules with the 'DFH' prefix).

%     Command-level calls are ignored if in an Assembler Â¨
      program with the &DFHEIMX variable set (mixed
      command/macro program).

The JCL isn't supplied but it is easy to work out.  For
completeness, here it is:

//jobname  JOB   your job
//MSCAN    EXEC  PGM=DFHMSCAN,PARM='$SUMMARY'
//STEPLIB  DD    DSN=mscan.loadlib,DISP=SHR
//INPUT    DD    DSN=your.loadlib1,DISP=SHR
//         DD    DSN=your.loadlib2,DISP=SHR
//         DD    etc
//OUTPUT   DD    SYSOUT=*
//SUMMARY  DD    SYSOUT=*
//SYSPRINT DD    SYSOUT=*
//SYSUDUMP DD    SYSOUT=*
//SNAP     DD    SYSOUT=*   <=== optional

PARM is well documented in the source.  I recommend
dumping all your DFHRPL concatenation chains into the above
INPUT DD; first run PARM='$SUMMARY', then eliminate
all 'command-level' and IBM libraries and run PARM='$ALL'
or PARM='prog1, prog2,...' for a detailed list.  If you include
the SNAP DD for a list of programs, a neat dump of each
program is also produced.

Finally, some interesting discoveries concerning two IBM
products which are worthy of note:

%     CSP:  Uses Assembler macro level and non-resident
     extrapartition transient data (withdrawn in CICS Version
     3.1).  Migrate to CSP 3.2.2 with PTF UL60339.

%     DB2:  The CICS interface is not only Assembler macro
      level but uses macros not officially described (eg DFHTD
      CTYPE=LOCATE) - a severe case of IBM breaking its
      o
      own rules.  This is true of DB2 Version 2.1.  I haven't
      checked DB2 Version 2.2 but remain confident that IBM
      will put its own house in order soon.

STOP PRESS

IBM has just announced the re-availability of DFHMSCAN as
a single PTF with no PREREQs (again!) - APAR PL55691 in
UL67960 (for CICS 1.7 and non-XA systems) or UL67963 (for
CICS 1.7 and XA systems).
