 Some further comments on INTERTEST
In the July 1987 issue of CICS Update, Kenneth Marquardt of Paper Converting
Machine Co gave a very positive review of On-line SoftwareUs INTERTEST.
However, INTERTEST has other features not mentioned in his article that are of
key importance to system administrators and application programmers.  The start-
up time of INTERTEST can be improved by a fix offered by On-line Software
International and improved further by an alternative fix proposed in this
article.
The following features make INTERTEST a powerful interactive debugger for
developing CICS applications:
%    Breakpoints can be requested by the user, by specifying a statement number,
a program label (COBOL paragraph name, PL/I or Assembler label), or hexadecimal
offset.  This is called a Tuser breakpointU;  a breakpoint issued upon possible
storage damage or CICS convention violation is an Tautomatic breakpointU.
Select function TBU in the main menu (Figure 2 in Mr MarquardtUs article) and
you will enter the following menu (see Figure 1).  A similar menu is displayed
for COBOL and Assembler programs.  Figure 2 shows another method of defining a
user breakpoint.
%    When at a breakpoint (Figure 3), storage can be displayed by name (Figure
4).  In COBOL, qualified and indexed names can be used.
%    When displaying storage of COBOL programs, Assembler programs, or CICS
areas, the format of display can be in the format of the data structure upon
pressing PF12 (Figure 5).
%    In both storage display formats, storage can be altered by overtyping the
display.
%    Breakpoints can be defined to occur conditionally, depending upon a value
of a variable in the program (specified by its name) compared to a literal value
or another variable.
GUIDELINES FOR SIMPLIFYING OPERATION
%    Monitoring a program without breakpoints is useful for following up
applications transferred to production after testing.
%    The production system can be defined so that upon an Tautomatic breakpointU
the transaction is abended and dumped, instead of a breakpoint screen being sent
to an end user.  Alternatively, the breakpoint screen can be directed to a
central terminal.  These options can be overridden for individual programs.
%    By implementing an optional TcheckpointU facility, INTERTEST can remember
its status across system shut-downs and start-ups.
%    The monitoring of an application can be specified to stop after n times.
If INTERTEST was started from a checkpoint, this count is remembered across
system start-ups.
%    With these two features, the maintenance of a production system needs no
table compilation or maintenance after the initial implementation, and can be
managed completely from on-line commands.
%    Start-up can be invoked by a CRLP terminal as well as a 3270.
IMPROVING START-UP TIME
As Kenneth MarquardtUs article states, the more programs monitored, the longer
it takes INTERTEST to start up.  This overhead became prohibitive for us as it
was taking INTERTEST five minutes to start.
On-line Software offers a fix to speed the start-up of INTERTEST in the source
of program IN25SERS (see comments above label WAIT1SEC).  Even this was not
sufficient for us, as we found that the output to the sequential terminal was
still slowing it down.  Since we use the Tglobal logging featureU, we do not
need to have INTERTEST TrespondU to the sequential terminal.  We recommend the
following fixes.
IMPROVING START-UP USING TCNTL=RESTARTU
Change the following in program IN25SER1:
1    Search for the label NOTSEQ:
     after:
     TM    ICCTL,ICYES+ICNOT   IC BUT NO TERMINAL ?
     BO    CONTPRIC            YES
     add:
     CLI   TCTTETT,TCTTETCR   CRLP TERMINAL?
     BE    CONTPRIC   YES, DONUT SEND TO HIM
2    Search for:
     CLRNOWR  XC    TWAGLOG,TWAGLOG:
     after:
      TM    ICCTL,ICYES+ICNOT       NO TERMINAL ?
     BO    RESNDBYP                YES, DO NOT RESEND
     add:
     CLI   TCTTETT,TCTTETCR   CRLP TERMINAL?
     BE    RESNDBYP  YES, DO NOT RESEND
3    Search for:
     SGLOGBYP EQU   *
     .BYGLOG4 LH    R6,0(,R7)          GET SIZE OF MESSAGE
     after:
     USING DFHTCTTE,TCTTEAR
     add:
     CLI   TCTTETT,TCTTETCR   CRLP TERMINAL?
     BE    SENDMSGI YES, GIVE SPECIAL TREATMENT
IMPROVING START-UP USING TCNTL=START,PROG=TABLENAMEU
Change the following in program IN25SERS:
search for the labels:
SGLOGBYP EQU   *
.BYGLOG4 LH    6,0(,R7)          GET SIZE OF MESSAGE
after:
USING DFHTCTTE,TCTTEAR
add:
CLI   TCTTETT,TCTTETCR   CRLP TERMINAL?
BE    SENDMSGI YES, GIVE SPECIAL TREATMENT
Assemble and link-edit the changed programs.  Start-up will be 20 seconds
regardless of the number of programs monitored.
