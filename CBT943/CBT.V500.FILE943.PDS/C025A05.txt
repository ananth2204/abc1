 Monitoring exit messages to CSSL

Under CICS 1.6.1 and now in 1.7 we use the monitoring task-related user exit to
intercept the CICS-produced SMF record before it is written to the journal and
extract required information for accumulation in our own CICS accounting block.
I had been informed by IBM that in this exit I could not make use of command-
level CICS and send messages to CSSL.  However, for testing the exit and, in
production, to give warnings when something is wrong, a method was found that
works.  The main parts of the code are:

MONEXIT  CSECT
