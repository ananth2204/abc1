CICS dump and IPCS

We have encountered a problem which we think many new
CICS 3.1 sites may also encounter.  The following account
applies to an MVS/ESA 4.1 and CICS/ESA 3.1.1 environment.

We have four CICS systems, one of which is a production
system, the rest development systems.  We require the
production system to run non-swappable, but the others to be
swappable.  To facilitate this, we made a copy of DFHSIP and
named it ZFHSIP, and placed only DFHSIP in the
SYS1.PARMLIB member SCHED00 with the NOSWAP
attribute.  DFHSIP is used for production CICS and ZFHSIP
for development systems.

We wanted to use IPCS to format and read our CICS dumps.
We tried with dumps from our development systems but every
time IPCS tried to format a dump we received the following
message:

      DFHPD0115 CICS job not found during ASCB scan

IBM tried to format our dumps and obtained the same message.
Eventually, IBM looked at the 'pink material' and found that
DFHPDX (the CICS dump formatting routine) makes a check
for the module name DFHSIP, and only allows processing of
this module.  As we were trying to format our development
dumps, the name it was finding was ZFHSIP, and therefore the
above message was issued.  Unfortunately, we could find no
reference to this restriction in the manuals, and therefore
wasted a lot of our time and also that of the IBM Support
Centre.

To get around this restriction, we made a copy of DFHPDX
and named in ZFHPDX.  A zap was been applied to ZFHPDX
to check for ZFHSIP instead of DFHSIP.  The necessary jobs
are shown below:

//ZAP      EXEC  PGM=AMASPZAP
//SYSPRINT DD  SYSOUT=*
//SYSLIB   DD  DSNAME=CIXESA.LOADLIB,DISP=SHR
//SYSIN    DD  *
  NAME ZFHPDX DFHPDX1
  DUMPT ZFHPDX DFHPDX1
/*

This job will produce a listing from which you can obtain the
offset of the characters DFHSIP.  The listing produced will
look something like the following:

000B20   C140 C4C6  C8E2 C9D7  4040 0000  0000 0010  F0F1 F2F3 F4F5 F6F7
         F8F9 C1C2  C3C4 C5C6
         *A DFHSIP ......*

From this listing we can see that the offset of DFHSIP is B22.
The following job should then be run:

//ZAP      EXEC  PGM=AMASPZAP
//SYSPRINT DD  SYSOUT=*
//SYSLIB   DD  DSNAME=CIXESA.LOADLIB,DISP=SHR
//SYSIN    DD  *
  NAME ZFHPDX DFHPDX1
  VER  0B22 C4C6C8E2C9D7
  REP  OB22 E9C6C8E2C9D7
  DUMPT ZFHPDX DFHPDX1
/*

This job will change DFHSIP to ZFHSIP and will produce a
listing so you can verify this.  We then added a new
VERBEXIT for IPCS to the SYS1.PARMLIB member
BLSCECTX as follows:

EXIT EP(ZFHPDX) VERB(CICSTDAT) ABSTRACT('Development CICS analysis')

It is now possible either to select CICSTDAT on the
component menu of IPCS, or to enter VERBX CICSTDAT as
an IPCS sub-command to view the formatted CICS dumps for
the development systems.
