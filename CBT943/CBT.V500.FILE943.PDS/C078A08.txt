Setting printer to 'create' at start-up - a response

This is a comment on the article Setting printer to 'create' at
start-up presented in CICS Update, issue 63 (February 1991).

We encountered a similar problem but found a much simpler,
more versatile solution. All of our printers are defined with a
terminal-id of L***. Our solution is to link to DFHEMTP and
pass CEMT commands to be executed by it. This program is
then included in the PLTPI and can be used as shown to
execute any CEMT SET command.  This ensures the required
setting of options that may have been modified during the
previous CICS run and preserved by a warm start. The program
could be further enhanced to read the commands from an
external file, making it even more versatile but more
complicated.
