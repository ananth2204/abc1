Security in CICS/ESA

With recent advances in RACF and CICS/ESA, security in a
CICS environment has moved from being almost entirely a
CICS problem to a point where everything can now be handled
by RACF.  IBM's Field Television Network (FTN) satellite
broadcast on 8 August dealt exclusively with the topic of CICS
security.  The speaker was Phil Emrich of the Dallas Systems
Center.  He began by outlining the security-related changes in
CICS/ESA 3.1.1 and CICS/ESA 3.2.1.


CICS/ESA 3.1.1

Security is tracked during an XRF takeover.  Sign-ons actually
occur on both systems, just milliseconds apart.

CSSN and CSSF have been removed as user transactions,
although they are still used internally.  They have been
replaced by CESN and CESF.  CESN is pseudo-
conversational, allowing it to be used as the good morning
transaction.  Sign-on can be customized in quite a number of
other ways, as well.  A next TRANSID can be coded to take
the user directly into an application from sign-on.  Transparent
sign-on is possible, as is the automatic sign-on of unattended
terminals (eg printers, terminals in secure areas) and MVS
consoles.

A new warning mechanism is provided within RACF that will
temporarily allow specified types of violations, but will provide
warning messages to the security administrator (SMF type 80
records).  This can be used to determine the source of hard-to-
find security violations.  It can also eliminate large numbers of
application failures because of security violations when
migrating to RACF or tightening control in an existing RACF
environment.  It is even possible to let the violation occur only
once before disallowing all future occurrences.

When RACF is called, read versus update intent is now
differentiated.  With Command Security (CMDSEC) in place,
the CICS Systems Programmer Interface (SPI) commands
INQUIRE and COLLECT require READ authority, while SET
and PERFORM require UPDATE authority.  Command
Security also applies to the CEMT, CEST, and CEOT
transactions.  There is even enough flexibility in Command
Security to allow a user to do nothing but NEWCOPY.  For
even more control, Resource Security could be used to restrict
which programs could be NEWCOPYed by a user.  A more
practical example might be restricting the users who can do
PERFORM SECURITY REBUILD.

EXEC CICS QUERY SECURITY can be used to make
applications more intelligent.  For example, specific fields on
an update screen could be automatically (by program logic)
protected (ie made read-only) for those users without the
authority to update them.  Or an update menu item might not
be displayed at all for users lacking the authority to modify any
fields displayed.

Other commands include ASSIGN CMDSEC and ASSIGN
RESSEC.  The response indicates whether Command Security
or Resource Security is active.  There are also INQUIRE
TRANSACTION CMDSEC and ...RESSEC, INQUIRE
TERMINAL SECURITY and ...SIGNONSTATUS commands.


CICS/ESA 3.2.1

QUERY SECURITY has been enhanced to include several new
parameters.  RESCLASS specifies the RACF class name, ie a
general resource class.  LOG, NOLOG, and LOGMESSAGE,
along with the current setting of global audit, control how this
QUERY command will be (security) logged.  ALTER and
CONTROL have been added to READ and UPDATE to
indicate the type of access for which security is being
requested.

A new DISCARD parameter has been added to SET and
PERFORM.  UPDATE access is required to use it.

New commands include ASSIGN USERNAME, INQUIRE
TERMINAL USERNAME, and ACCESS ACEE.  ACEE is
the RACF installation information control block, the Access
Control Environment Element.

Internal security has been completely removed, but ASSIGN
OPID, OPCLASS, and USERID; and INQUIRE TERMINAL
OPERID and USERID are still supported because the operator-
id is not considered security data by CICS.

Although ASSIGN OPERKEYS and ASSIGN OPSECURITY
are still supported, nulls are returned as values, so existing
applications being migrated may fail if they expect something
more meaningful.

DCT, JCT, and other tables coded as macros will not work if
they use the RSL or DFHSNT keywords.  RDO parameters
TRANSEC, EXTSEC, and TRANSECNUM (CICS 3.1.1 only)
have also been removed.

A stand-alone SNT Migration Aid is provided that generates a
CLIST of RACF ADDUSER and ALTUSER statements from
an SNT.  The SNT is not required with RACF 1.9, but for 1.8,
an SNT that contains no security information is required.

Using RACF 1.9, the sign-on process consists of CICS doing a
RACROUTE VERIFY, a RACROUTE EXTRACT, and then
building the SNTTE from user data.  With 1.8, CICS actually
uses the mini-SNT.

For LU6.2 under RACF 1.9, CICS provides bind security
when SIT APPC=YES and the RDO parameter
BINDSECURITY(YES) are specified.  CICS extracts the
session key and does encryption token exchange.

The performance of ATTACHSEC(VERIFY) has been
markedly improved.  RACF services are used, rather than
constantly repeating the sign-on process as occurred in the past.

Several new SIT parameters are provided.  SEC can now be
YES, NO, or MIGRATE.  NO indicates there will be no calls
to RACF.  MIGRATE indicates that RACF was used by CICS
prior to the installation of CICS/ESA.  All UPDATE requests
are turned into READ requests as they would have appeared
before the differentiation of intent that occurred with
CICS/ESA 3.1.1.

XFCT, XPCT, etc can now be set to an installation-defined
resource class for each region.  DFLTUSER assigns a default
user-id for transactions authorized for use when not signed on.
External Security Manager Exits (ESMEXITs) can be used to
pass data to the exits of RACF or a non-IBM security package.

Some concern was expressed in the FTN that, with the on-
going restructuring of the internals of CICS, non-IBM security
systems are less and less likely to work unless they use the
documented interfaces.


RACF 1.9 ENHANCEMENTS

Because each CICS region has a unique RACF user-id, dataset
name protection can match datasets to CICS regions.  This
approach can be used to prevent production datasets being
opened in a test environment, such as might occur if the wrong
SIT were used.

Transaction authorization can specify both the user-id and
terminal-id accessing a transaction, allowing simultaneous
control of who, where, and what through the PERMIT ...
WHEN command.  It is also possible to audit every use of
critical transactions.

Assuming at least Version 3.1.3 of JES2 or 3, batch jobs can
now be submitted from CICS using the user-id of the signed on
user, rather than the user-id of the CICS address space.
