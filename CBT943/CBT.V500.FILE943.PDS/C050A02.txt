Master terminal commands in batch - a reply

INTRODUCTION

This is a response to the article Executing master terminals in
batch, which was published in Issue 46 of CICS Update
(September 1989).

CEMT INITIALISATION PROGRAM

During CICS start-up you can execute a simple command-level
program during the PLTPI phase which links to the CEMT
initialisation program DFHEMTP.

 IDENTIFICATION DIVISION.
 PROGRAM-ID. B005PGM.
*    THIS PROGRAM IS INVOKED DURING PLTPI PHASE IN ORDER TO     *
*    SET THE DUMPFILES TO AUTO SWITCHING                        *
 ENVIRONMENT DIVISION.

 WORKING-STORAGE SECTION.
 01  COMMAND1.
     03  FILLER    PIC X(13)   VALUE 'SET DUMP AUTO'.
 LINKAGE SECTION.
 01  DFHCOMMAREA   PIC X(31).
 01  BLLCELLS.
     03  BLL-CELL-PTR     PIC S9(8)  COMP.
 PROCEDURE DIVISION.
 B003PGM-MAIN.
     EXEC CICS LINK PROGRAM ('DFHEMTP')
                    COMMAREA (COMMAND1)
                    LENGTH (13)
                    END-EXEC.
     EXEC CICS RETURN END-EXEC.
     GOBACK.

When you want to execute more than one command you can
code multiple EXEC CICS LINKs with different
COMMAREAs.

The drawback with this way of working is that the commands
are hard-coded in the program and, if you want to change, add,
or delete commands, you have to recompile and re-link the
program.  To circumvent this problem you could make the
program a little more complicated, so that it reads a member
from a PDS library, which is defined to CICS as an extra-
partition transient data queue, and in which you may have
different lines, each with a master terminal command.

* NAME IS THEN BSYS0002) AND INVOKES DFHEMTD FOR EVERY  *
* CONTROL STATEMENT.                                    *
 ENVIRONMENT DIVISION.
 DATA DIVISION.
 WORKING-STORAGE SECTION.
 01  COMMAND.
     03  FILLER         PIC  X(80).
 01  QUEUE-LENGTH       PIC  9(04)  COMP   VALUE 80.
 PROCEDURE DIVISION.
 BSYS0001-MAIN.
     EXEC CICS HANDLE ABEND
                    LABEL(BSYS0001-OUT)
                    END-EXEC.
     EXEC CICS HANDLE CONDITION
                    ERROR(BSYS0001-OUT)
                    END-EXEC.
 BSYS0001-LOOP.
     EXEC CICS READQ TD
                    QUEUE('PLT1')
                    INTO(COMMAND)
                    LENGTH(QUEUE-LENGTH)
                    END-EXEC.
     EXEC CICS LINK PROGRAM('DFHEMTP')
                    COMMAREA(COMMAND)
                    LENGTH (80)
                    END-EXEC.
     GO TO BSYS0001-LOOP.
 BSYS0001-OUT.
     EXEC CICS RETURN END-EXEC.
     GOBACK.

Depending on which CICS and/or which type of start-up you
employ, you can use different members in the PDS.  To add,
delete, or change commands, you then just have to edit the
member(s) in the PDS via ISPF.

It should be noted that in the CICS start-up JCL you must have
a DD statement with the DSNAME of the PDS library, for
example CICSDD.PLTPI.DATA(PLTP1),  and in the DCT
you must define the queue(s).

INTERNAL READER

As was mentioned in the article referred to above, you can
execute a simple IEBGENER which will put an MVS modify
command (which will perform the CEMT command) into the
internal reader.

Normally the transaction CEMT will be secured so you will
first have to execute an MVS modify in order to perform a log-
on to CICS (transaction CSSN).

//CICDUM  JOB  (,ESCA,P),
// MSGLEVEL=(1,1),
// REGION=3072K,
// MSGCLASS=J,PRTY=12
//*
*******************************************************************
//* CICDUM
//* SWITCH CICS1-DUMPFILES
//* ----------------------------------------------------------------
//SSION    EXEC PGM=IEBGENER,COND=(4,LT)
//SYSPRINT DD SYSOUT=Z
//SYSIN    DD *
  GENERATE MAXFLDS=2
    RECORD FIELD=(71,3,,1)
/*
//SYSUT1   DD *
  /*$VS,'F LUCCIC1,CSSN NAME ESSCIC1 PS=TEST'
//SYSUT2   DD SYSOUT=(,INTRDR)
/*
//*
//WAIT1    EXEC PGM=WAIT,PARM='000050'
//*
//SCLOSE   EXEC PGM=IEBGENER,COND=(4,LT)
//SYSPRINT DD SYSOUT=Z
//SYSIN    DD *
  GENERATE MAXFLDS=2
    RECORD FIELD=(71,3,,1)
/*
//SYSUT1   DD *
  /*$VS,'F LUCCIC1,CEMT SET DUMP AUTO'
  /*$VS,'F LUCCIC1,CSSF LOGOFF'
//SYSUT2   DD SYSOUT=(,INTRDR)
/*

Unfortunately, here you have a serious security exposure
because the password is either hard-coded in the SYSIN of the
IEBGENER or the operator will have to enter his/her password
on the console.  In both cases, the password will appear in
readable form on SYSLOG and everyone who can browse
SYSLOG will know the password.  As we use CA-TOP
SECRET as a security package we defined a special accessor-id
for CICS (ESSCIC1) which is allowed to use the facility CICS
but only from the MVS/JES console (the access to the console
is physically secure - only operators can enter the computer
room).  Via SDSF one can also execute MVS commands but
here again this is restricted to operators and system
programmers.

The special user-id ESSCIC1 is defined to CA-TOP SECRET
with the attribute NO PASSWORD, but the transaction CSSN
always asks for a password; this is why in the JCL example
below we had to code something (in our case PS=TEST), but
this has no meaning for CA-TOP SECRET.

NETVIEW

The above mentioned method can be used in combination with
NetView when you have to respond to a certain message in
order to execute a command.

In the case of the dump dataset switching, the switch will only
occur once.  If you want to use the dump A and B extents in a
flip-flop manner, you must perform the CEMT SET DUMP
AUTO again when a switch has occurred.  To do this
automatically you can use NetView, which will respond when
the message from CICS appears telling you that the dump
dataset was full and that a switch has occurred.

For example, in the automation member of NetView you could
put the following:

    IF MSGID = 'DFH0701' & TEXT = MSG
    THEN EXEC (CMD('MVS S JOB,N=CICDUM') ROUTE (ONE AUTOMVS))

This will start the job above.
