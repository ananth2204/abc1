Unknown DFHUAKP


THE PROBLEM

Using THE MONITOR FOR CICS, I noticed that the average
file time in our production CICS environment for DFHRPL
access was poor. This in turn was degrading overall transaction
response time. Curious to see exactly which modules were
being fetched,  using THE MONITOR FOR MVS I traced the
seeks for our production CICS on the volumes under DFHRPL.
I found many seeks for the module DFHUAKP. Looking in my
CICS.LOADLIB, I found that this module didn't exist. Further
investigation revealed that DFHUAKP is called each time a
system activity keypoint is taken.

Look in your CICS.LOADLIB to see if you have DFHUAKP.
In your CICS statistics, the number of times the program
DFHAKP has been used will give you the number of attempts
to fetch DFHUAKP.

We are running CICS/MVS 2.1.1 under MVS/ESA. IBM is
aware of the problem, which in some instances can cause an
AICA (runaway task) abend.


THE SOLUTION

Our solution was to assemble a dummy DFHUAKP module
and place it in CICS.LOADLIB. Using RDO, we copied the
group DFHMISC to a new group called DFHUAKP. We
altered the entry for the program DFHUAKP in this new group
to RESIDENT=YES, and finally replaced the DFHMISC group
with the DFHUAKP group in our list.
