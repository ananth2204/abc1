Reader's letter
In James E Holler's article in issue 53 about task priorities, it is
stated that every time a program requests service from CICS
through an EXEC command or by issuing a CICS macro, it
does a dispatch scan.  This is not so.  In fact, CICS seldom
does a dispatch scan.  Certainly, EXEC commands like
ASSIGN and ADDRESS do not make CICS perform a dispatch
scan.  The only EXEC commands that make CICS do a
dispatch scan are the ones that would make the task wait for a
period of time.  Reading files and the SUSPEND command
will always mean a dispatch scan.  Commands such as ENQ
will only mean a dispatch scan if the resource is not available.

This means that even though you are issuing CICS commands
your program could still suffer an AICA abend.  If you want to
know which commands cause a dispatch scan, you can see
them in a trace.  If you see KCP DISPATCH, it means that
CICS is doing a dispatch scan.
