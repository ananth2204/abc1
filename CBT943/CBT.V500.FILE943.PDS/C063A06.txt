Collecting CICS transaction counts from RMF

The problem with using RMF to collect CICS transaction
counts is that MVS sees CICS as a single transaction and is,
therefore, unable to break down the CICS region into actual
transaction numbers or average transaction times.

It is a well known fact that this can be overcome by defining a
Report Performance Group for each CICS region required in
the IEAICSxx member found on PARMLIB.

At our company, each CICS region has a Report Performance
Group number which is ten times the value of the Performance
Group.  Thus our testing region has a Performance Group
number of 25 and a Report Performance Group number of 250.
The Report Performance Group parameters in the ICS would
be:

      SUBSYS=MNTD,RPGN=250

and

      TRXNAME=MNTDTP,PGN=25,RPGN=250

The other step required is to ensure that the SIT for the CICS
region has MCT=YES specified (to switch CICS monitoring
on) and MONITOR=EVE (to enable CICS SYSEVENTs to
catch the transactions).

The problem with using Report Performance Groups is that
SMF/RMF only looks for the first four characters of the
APPLID and it was therefore necessary to make the first four
characters of each APPLID unique in order to be able to make
use of Report Performance Groups.

The problem we encountered was that we wanted to use the
same four-letter prefix for all our VTAM components as they
are referenced by external networks.  By introducing this
standard, we were unable to make use of the Report
Performance Group number and had to look to another, more
time consuming, way of obtaining the transaction counts via
OMEGAMON.

The problem has now been overcome by applying a simple
ZAP to DFHCMON.  This ZAP (via SMP) changes the code to
look at the last four characters of the APPLID, which are
unique in our installation, instead of the first four characters.

The ZAP is as follows:

++USERMOD(UMODMON) .
++VER(C150) FMID(HCI2113) .
++MACUPD(DFHCMON) DISTLIB(SOURCE) ASSEM(DFHCMON).
./ CHANGE NAME=DFHCMON
*        MVC   MCTVNSSN(4),SITGAPLD  set subsystem id from 4       @L9C 521000
         MVC   MCTVNSSN(4),SITGAPLD+4 set subsystem id from last 4 @DGM 521000
./ ENDUP

Of course, the SUBSYS parameter in the IEAICSxx had to be changed to
the last four characters of the APPLID.

I would like to acknowledge my thanks to Brian MacFarlane of IBM for
his help in this study.
