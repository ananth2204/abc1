 Pseudo-conversational transaction monitoring
Many of our CICS applications are developed using query languages and are
pseudo-conversational.  Performance monitoring is often requested.  However,
distinguishing performance records among applications developed with the same
query language may be clumsy even if different front-end transaction-ids are
assigned.  Replicate update to CICS tables is required.  The following is a
simple method of selecting CMF records for an application (in this case SMSG,
which was developed with NATURAL and has a transaction-id of NA16).  SAS/MXG is
our reporting tool, although IBM SLR, Assembler, or a high-level language could
be made to serve the same purpose.
