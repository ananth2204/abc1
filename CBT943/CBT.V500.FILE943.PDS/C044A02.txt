Controlling FCT start-up

THE PROBLEM

CICS requires the FCT to be cold-started to allow for changes to
almost all the parameters contained in that table.  However, when
an emergency restart of CICS occurs, file back-out is often
required.  This implies that the FCT must be warm-started, since a
cold start would not allow the back-out process to function.
Given these two conflicting requirements, it is safest to warm-start
the FCT by default, except when a change to the FCT is required.
Then, when the FCT is cold-started, it is necessary to see that no
need for file back-out will occur.  Obviously, this presents some
undesirable complexities in the CICS operation instructions.

THE SOLUTION

I have written a very simple program which executes at CICS
system initialisation time to determine if an emergency start-up is
being performed.  If it is, the FCT start-up is forced to 'warm'.
Under normal circumstances the start-up for CICS would call for a
cold start of the FCT.  This allows for changes to come into effect
at the earliest possible date.  By changing the FCT to warm-start
only during a CICS emergency start, file integrity is maintained
by allowing back-out to proceed when required.  The program as
written executes between modules DFHSIC1 and DFHSID1.  To
cause this to happen, simply code the following as a system
initialisation override parameter:

	SIMODS=(A1,B1,C1,C9,D1,E1,F1,G1,H1,I1,J1)

Under CICS 1.7, this will allow all the IBM DFHSIxx modules to
execute in addition to DFHSIC9.
