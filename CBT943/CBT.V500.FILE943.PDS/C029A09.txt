 A USERMOD for DFHRTE
I concur with the article in the October 1987 issue (Making CRTE user friendly)
that CRTE is a valuable tool, and at best user-tolerant.  We have made a change
to DFHRTE to make the situation somewhat less frustrating.
Our environment is a CICS 1.7/CICS 1.6.1 mixed MRO environment with one Terminal
Owning Region (TOR) and six Application Owning Regions (AORs).  We run an IBM
3081K under MVS/XA 2.1.3 and use ACF2 to provide transaction and sign-on
security.
We were dissatisfied with the way that the CRTE transaction returned to the TOR
after an explicit route.  We had two requirements for modifications.  Firstly,
CRTE should not force a CSSF transaction when CANCEL was used to return to the
TOR, and secondly, CRTE should recognise a sign-off transaction issued in a
routed session, terminate the route, and sign the user off of the CICS MRO
systems.  The second requirement is feasible as ACF2 does not require that you
do a sign-on in the AOR, your sign-on is passed with the rest of the information
about your terminal.
The attached PTF accomplishes these objectives.  The section of code modified is
invoked to scan the characters being routed for the string TCANCELU.  Field
ISCRQTRN contains the transaction-id to be invoked when the route is terminated.
At offset hexadecimal D0 from register 4 is the beginning of the terminal input.
The added code scans not only for TCANCELU, but for the six sign-on/sign-off
transactions that we use as well.  If TCANCELU is found, then we just terminate
the route and set the next transaction-id to blanks.  If one of the sign-
on/sign-off transactions is found, then the route is terminated and that
transaction is invoked.  This allows us to route over to an AOR and then come
back without having to sign-on to the TOR again.
This fix has been used on CICS 1.6.1/370, CICS 1.6.1/XA, and CICS 1.7.0/XA with
equal success.  The line numbers on the PTF represent the fix for CICS 1.7 at
PUT level 8703 +/-.  The fix should be installed a couple of lines after label
RTE0040.  The branch not equal to RTE0043 and the move of CSSF to ISCRQTRN are
the two lines that should provide the beginning line numbers.  Examine the
source for DFHRTE at your installation and adjust the line numbers as
appropriate.
