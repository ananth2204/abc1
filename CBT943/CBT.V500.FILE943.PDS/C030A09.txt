 Password expiration warnings for CICS users
CICS is used by the vast majority of on-line users at our company.  To verify
user-ids and passwords in CICS we use RACF as the external security interface.
Our audit requirements specify all passwords must expire in 90 days if not
changed.  Moreover, only three attempts to enter a correct password (new or old)
are allowed.  After the third attempt RACF revokes the user-id.  CICS, unlike
TSO, gives no warning when a password is close to expiring and on the 90th day
demands a new password.  In the past, this frequently led to revoked user-ids as
bewildered users tried to understand the Tnew passwordU screen in CICS.  Memos
or personal instruction on password rules and how to enter new passwords were
usually forgotten within 90 days.
By employing the following programs we are now able to send CICS users a warning
screen 10 days before their password expires.  In addition, we provide on-line
help panels describing the CICS sign-on process and the RACF password rules.
This has helped to reduce the confusion surrounding passwords and is a better
form of communication than a memo.
The programs mentioned above consist of a RACF user exit and two CICS programs.
No CICS usermods are required.  The userUs Access Control Environment Element
(ACEE) is the common control block between RACF and CICS.  It is used to pass a
pointer to the userUs password expiration value.  If RACF is not your security
package you may be able to use the following (especially the CICS control block
relationships) as a guide for writing your own version.  The programs are
currently implemented under RACF 1.7 and CICS 1.7 on an MVS/XA operating system.
RACF USER EXIT
The RACF RACINIT post-processing user exit (ICHRIX02) is used to access
information concerning the userUs password.  The exit has access (via register
1) to a parameter list containing, among other things, the ACEE address, the
password last change date, and the password change interval.  Using this
information the number of days before the password will expire is calculated.
If the number of days is within a specified warning period (10 days at our
company) it is made available to CICS by setting a pointer (ACEEIEP offset XTCU)
in the userUs ACEE.  ACEEIEP addresses two words of storage previously GETMAINed
by the routine.  This storage is used first as working storage for packed
decimal to binary conversions, and later to store the number of days before
password expiration.  When used for the latter, the first word contains the
subpool number and length of this storage.  The second word is used to store the
password expiration days.  The subpool and length value in the first word is a
RACF requirement.  RACF FREEMAINs this area when the user signs off.
If the number of days calculated is not within the warning period the ACEE is
left unaltered and the previously GETMAINed storage is FREEMAINed.
The System Programming Library: RACF manual describes the RACF user exit in
detail including link-edit requirements and how to implement the user exit on
your system.  In addition, it has a complete layout of the RACINIT parameter
list and the ACEE control block.  Pay particular attention to the note
concerning the ACEE field ACEEIEP.
CICS SIGN-ON PROGRAM
In CICS, two programs are used to control the sign-on process and to access the
user's ACEE.  I named these programs SYS030P and SYS031P.
SYS030P is a COBOL command-level program.  It is assigned the transaction-id of
CSSN (and/or CESN) so it can control the sign-on process.  If implemented in the
manner described below it requires a 4-byte TWA.  It begins by LINKing to
DFHSNP, the CICS sign-on program.  DFHSNP performs the actual sign-on and RACF
interface.  On return, SYS030P checks the USERID field to determine if the sign-
on was successful (pre-CICS 1.7 releases could use OPID).  If the USERID value
is low the sign-on was unsuccessful, and SYS030P returns to CICS.  If
successful, SYS030P links to SYS031P.
SYS031P, a macro-level Assembler program, walks through a chain of CICS control
blocks in order to access the userUs ACEE.  This chain is described as follows:
on entry register 12 always addresses the TCA User Area.  At offset 8 into the
TCA, TCAFCAAA addresses the TCTTE (TCT Terminal Entry).  At offset XT5CU into
the TCTTE, field TCTTESNT addresses the SNTTE (Sign-on Table Terminal Entry).
Field SNNTUBLK of the SNTTE at offset XTCU addresses the userUs ACEE.  (This is
a 31-bit address under an MVS/XA operating system.)  At offset XTCU into the
userUs ACEE, the ACEEIEP field is tested.  If ACEEIEP is not zero it addresses
the password expiration value calculated by the RACINIT user exit.  This value

 is returned to SYS030P via the 4-byte transaction work area.  The control block
chain is summarised in Figure 1.
On return, SYS030P checks the TWA field.  If it is non-zero, SYS030P XCTLs to
another program passing the password expiration value in the COMMAREA.  This
other program displays a warning screen using all but the last line on the
terminal so as not to erase the DFH3504I message generated by DFHSNP.  The
program also offers the user two help screens that describe the sign-on process
and RACF password rules.

*** FOR CICS USERS THIS EXIT WILL CALCULATE THE NUMBER OF DAYS LEFT   ***
*  BEFORE A USER'S PASSWORD WILL EXPIRE.  IF THE NUMBER OF DAYS LEFT    *
*  IS <= 10 (THE WARNING PERIOD) THE VALUE IS STORED IN A GETMAINED     *
*  AREA AND THE ADDRESS PLACED IN FIELD ACEEIEP (OFFSET X'C') OF THE    *
*  USER'S ACEE.  INSTALLATION WRITTEN CICS PROGRAMS (SYS030P & SYS031P) *
*  WILL INSPECT THIS FIELD AND SEND A WARNING MESSAGE TO THE USER.      *
*  ON ENTRY TO THIS EXIT, REGISTER 1 POINTS TO A PARAMETER LIST PASSED  *
*  BY RACINIT.  AMONG OTHER THINGS THIS LIST CONTAINS THE PASSWORD LAST *
*  CHANGE DATE AND THE PASSWORD CHANGE INTERVAL.  HOWEVER, BEFORE ANY   *
*  CALCULATIONS ARE MADE THE FOLLOWING CHECKS ARE MADE: 1.) THIS IS A   *
*  SIGN-ON (THAT IS ENVIR=CREATE WAS SPECIFIED), 2.) THE SIGN-ON WAS    *
*  SUCCESSFUL (RC=0), AND  3.) WE HAVE AN ACEE ADDRESS. IF ALL CHECKS   *
*  PASS, EIGHT BYTES OF STORAGE ARE GETMAINED. USING THE PARAMETER LIST *
*  THE NUMBER OF DAYS BEFORE PASSWORD EXPIRATION IS CALCULATED. IF THE  *
*  NUMBER OF DAYS IS NOT WITHIN THE WARNING PERIOD THE WORKING STORAGE  *
*  IS FREED AND CONTROL RETURNS TO RACF. OTHERWISE, WRKAREA IS          *
*  FORMATTED (SEE SPL-RACF CHAPTER 12-1, NOTE 1) AND THE NUMBER-OF-DAYS *
*  VALUE IS STORED. THE ADDRESS OF THIS AREA IS LOADED INTO THE ACEE    *
