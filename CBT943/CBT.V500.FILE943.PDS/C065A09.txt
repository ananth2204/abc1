Statistics for auto-installed terminals

For a number of years we have used a program which scans the
CICS shutdown statistics (written to a sequential DASD file)
and extracts and summarizes useful information.  In particular
we are interested in terminal message counts based on
groupings by the first one or two characters of the terminal-id.
Recently we implemented auto-install for terminals attached to
several other computers but linked to ours.  We found that we
needed to do something to capture statistics for those terminals
as well.

The solution was an additional error processor added to the
CICS-supplied sample Node Error Program, DFHZNEP.  The
code is given below.  The following comments about the
program should be noted:

1      The format of the output record corresponds to the format
      of the CICS shutdown statistics, which may vary
      somewhat from one CICS release to another (ours is
      CICS/VSE 1.7).  However, the line starts with 'AUTO'
      instead of 'VTAM' to allow for the identification of these
      records.

2      The GROUP specification on the first statement may need
      to be adjusted if you have other error processing routines in
      your node error program.

3      A possible modification would be to write the VTAM
      terminal-id instead of, or in addition to, the CICS-id.  This
      would be useful when the two do not have a one-to-one
      relationship.

4      For simplicity, the processor creates its output record
      within the program.  Although this may not be the best
      CICS programming practice, it does not cause any
      problems since control is not relinquished to CICS before
      the transient data output request.

5      The specification of a zero index register on several load
      instructions suppresses alignment error messages on the
      VSE Assembler.  This trick doesn't work on some MVS
      Assemblers.  You can either ignore the warning messages
      or change the load instructions to ICM instructions.
