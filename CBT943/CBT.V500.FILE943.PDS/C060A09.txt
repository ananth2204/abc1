IBM announcements - a postscript

In last month's account of the 5 September announcements
from IBM, we concentrated entirely on CICS/ESA 3.2 and
CICS/VSE 2.1.  In doing so, we missed a few of the gems
buried away in the pile of PLETs that landed on our editor's
desk.  Briefly, CICS-related changes that appeared in the
announcements of other IBM products were as follows.


DL/I DOS/VS 1.9

There will be a new SIT parameter in CICS/VSE 2.1 which
will offer users the choice of specifying whether database
errors should cause the CICS DL/I system to abend or continue
with the database in a closed state.


QMF VERSION 3

It will be possible to run QMF Version 3 as a conversational
transaction under CICS/MVS or CICS/ESA.  QMF Version 3
will be generally available from January 1991.


IMS/ESA DATABASE MANAGER 3.2

IMS/ESA Database Manager 3.2 removes the need to take IMS
databases off-line in order to perform image copies.  This
concurrent image copy facility supports full function databases
and DEDBs under CICS/ESA or IMS/ESA Transaction
Manager 3.2.
