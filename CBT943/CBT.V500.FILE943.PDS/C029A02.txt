 Avoiding use of shut-down PLT
At our installation we have several product packages running under CICS which
must be closed before taking CICS down or an A03 abend will result.  Since it is
common for users to leave themselves signed on, we cannot rely on PLT processing
to clean up CICS tasks.
Before entering the command to perform immediate shut-down of CICS, the operator
enters a transaction to invoke the clean up program.  This program calls the
programs necessary to shut down our packages.
One of these packages did not use a PLT program but expected the TIOA to contain
specific information.  For that one, I put the information into the TIOA and
then linked to the program.  The code can easily be expanded to include more
links as needed without any change to operator instructions.
