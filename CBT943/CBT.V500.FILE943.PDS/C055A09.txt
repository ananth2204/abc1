Reader's letter

I found Alida Jatich's article on CICS OS/2 1.20 to be a good
introduction to the product.  However, I would like to correct
some inaccuracies I found in the article.

In describing the communication support in CICS OS/2, a
mention was made of being able to link to other systems using
CRTE.  Actually the CRTE transaction is not available on
CICS OS/2.  You do, however, have the capability of using
CRTE on your host CICS to route transactions to CICS OS/2.
Under the requirements for CICS OS/2, it was stated that a 386
machine or better is required.  Actually, in order to run CICS
OS/2 under OS/2, a 286 machine or better is required.  I run it
on a PS/2 model 60, which is a 286 machine.  A suggestion
was also made to run it under OS/2 EE 1.2 rather than OS/2 EE
1.1.  At the present time there appear to be some problems
with CICS OS/2 when run on OS/2 1.2 and it is probably a
better idea to run it under 1.1 for the time being.

Under the advantages of CICS OS/2, the article mentioned that
CICS OS/2 will display an error message if an application tries
to alter storage that doesn't belong to it.  It is really OS/2, not
CICS OS/2, which is enforcing storage protection.  If a user
application or CICS OS/2 itself tries to tamper with other
storage, the OS/2 session is terminated with an OS/2 error.  No
indication is given as to what program caused the storage
protection violation or at what displacement in the program it
occurred.
