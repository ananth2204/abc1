 Readers' letters

Thanks for the June article Balancing CICS response times.  It works and has
been a great help in my efforts to make response times more consistent.  For
those users who, like myself, want to use the exit for all programs, but do not
want to maintain a table to avoid problems with system initialisation and
termination, here is an easy way around that.

Field CSAXST1 can be used to determine what stage the CICS system is in;
initialisation, execution, or termination.  The following instructions can be
used:

         CLI   CSAXST1,CSAXSEX         IS CICS IN EXECUTION?
         BNE   ENDPRI                  NO..GO DO RETURN

These instructions can immediately follow the BALR and USING to establish the
base register.

The April 1987 (issue 17) article OSCOR display transaction contained some
coding errors.  The most significant error was found four instructions under
label B200:

         L     R1,X'F0'(R1)    HI ADDRESS ALLOCATED FROM

should read

         L     R1,X'D0'(R1)    HI ADDRESS ALLOCATED FROM

Or better still, macro IEFTCT could be used to map the SMF Timing Control Table
and the above instruction could be changed to reference field TCTLWM.

Also, three instructions under label B400:

         CH    R1,=H'10240'         Q - SUFFICIENT UNASSIGNED?

should read

         C     R1,=F'10240'         Q - SUFFICIENT UNASSIGNED?
Also, I couldn't get some of the housekeeping statements to assemble with IEUASM
(Assembler F).  I had to make the following modifications:

Original:      TABLE   DS    (TABMAX*(ENTEND-TABENTRY))C
Modified:      TABLE   DS    (TABMAX*17)C
Original:      WTOAREA DS    (WTOL)C
Modified:      WTOAREA DS    CL44

The program, with the above changes, works well and is very useful for tracking
OSCOR on our test and production CICS systems.

Thanks to everybody who responded to our request for further information about
the article VSE/VSAM path and alternate index processing by Larry Halvorsen of
IBM.  The article can be found on either INFO/SYS or the IBM internal database,
SETI, document number OZSQ271323, item number 976BW; although one reader gave us
a document number of OZSQ319255 and a reference number of SDFC4.  Although it is
aimed primarily at VSE shops, some of the information is equally applicable to
MVS installations.
