 Swapping address spaces - a simpler solution
In the March 1988 issue of CICS Update, an article entitled Swapping the CICS
address space suggested using DFHKCP exits along with two programs to alter CICS
swappability status.  In our shop, we have approached this in a much simpler,
although less flexible, way.
First, we assigned an alias of DFHSIPSW to the program DFHSIP.  This can be
accomplished by re-linking the DFHSIP program in-place using link control
statements such as:
     INCL SYSLIB(DFHSIP)
     ALIAS DFHSIPSW
     NAME DFHSIP(R)
The program name DFHSIP was then added to the MVS Program Properties Table.
When we start our production CICS region, we use the program name DFHSIP, which
makes the production region non-swappable.  The test regions are started using
the program alias DFHSIPSW, which causes these regions to be swappable.
We are running MVS non-XA and CICS 1.6.1 converting to 1.7 on an IBM 3081.
