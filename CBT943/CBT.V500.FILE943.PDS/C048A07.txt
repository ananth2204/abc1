CEDF ZAP to continue session

If you are a user of the CICS-supplied Execution Diagnostic
Facility (EDF) transaction, CEDF, in a pseudo-conversational
environment, the following ZAP will be invaluable.

When monitoring a sequence of transactions you are often only
interested in the nth one, so you must forge your way through the
transactions leading up to it.  Logically, the 'suppress displays'
function is used; however, by default EDF will halt on 'any CICS
Error'.  To override this you enter the 'stop conditions display' and
change 'any CICS error' from 'yes' to 'no'.  The default can be set
to 'no'.  At the termination of each transaction, EDF will display
the message 'to continue EDF session reply yes'.  The default
reply is 'no' and this can be set to 'yes'.

The SMP/E USERMOD below will alter either or both of these
defaults.  It fits on the CICS 1.7 load module, DFHEDFD.

++USERMOD (UM?????)
/*
