 CICS 1.7 DCT warm start USERMOD
All Communications Oriented Production Information and Control System (COPICS)
users experience the need for a DCT warm start.  There are a number of
asynchronous database update transactions that could be lost if the DCT warm
start abends.  The loss would not be noticed until the next day and could only
be corrected after a cold start.
The following is an alternative to the method described in issue 32 ÝCICS 1.7
DCT warm start local modification, pages 21-23¨ to always obtain a warm (or when
needed emergency) restart of the DCT, unless you specifically request a cold
start.
The program DFHSID1 (system initialisation program for transient data) has the
following logic to decide which type of start it should use for DCT:
%    If the CICS start-up is (COLD,ALL), the DCT is TcoldU started.
%    If the CICS start-up is (WARM,ALL), the DCT is TwarmU started.
%    If the CICS start-up is (EMER,ALL), the DCT is TemergencyU started.
%    If DCT=(...,COLD) is coded in the SIT, the DCT is TcoldU started.
%    If the CICS start-up is (EMER), the DCT is TemergencyU started.
%    If the CICS start-up is (WARM), the DCT is TwarmU started.
%    Otherwise, the DCT is TcoldU started.
You can see that by changing the last line to WARM, the DCT will be TwarmU
started unless you specify in the CICS start-up (COLD,ALL) or DCT=(...,COLD).
The modification to DFHSID1 is implemented by applying the following USERMOD:
++USERMOD (USER099).
++VER (C150) FMID(HCI1703) .
++MACUPD (DFHSID1) DISTLIB(SOURCE) ASSEM(DFHSID1).

Testing can be performed in the way described in issue 32.  Of course, other
testing possibilities exist, such as invoking an abend of an asynchronous
database update transaction by closing and disabling the database.
