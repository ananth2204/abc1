 A new reason for INVREQ under 1.7.0
In the course of our migration from CICS 1.6.1 to 1.7.0, we encountered an
unusual problem.  When issuing the DFHFC TYPE,RDIADR=xxxx,TYPOPER=NEWREC
request, two of our application programs received an INVREQ.  Under 1.6.1 these
programs didnUt cause this problem so we felt that CICS might be checking
something that it didnUt under 1.6.1.
Our investigation proved this to be the case.  There is now an added check under
CICS 1.7 in DFHFCP that compares the value of the key pointed to by the RDIADR
operand with the actual key within the record you are attempting to add.  If
these two values are not equal you will receive an INVREQ.  I have not found
this new reason for INVREQ documented in any CICS manual.
