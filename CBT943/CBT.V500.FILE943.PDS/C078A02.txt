Unknown DFHUAKP - alternative solutions

Having read the article Unknown DFHUAKP in the March
1992 issue of CICS Update, I would like to present the
following methods as alternative solutions. These methods
have been developed and tested in an MVS/ESA 4.1 and
CICS/MVS 2.1.2 environment.


METHOD ONE

The following dummy DFHUAKP module will run much
faster.

DFHEISTG DSECT
DFHUAKP  CSECT
         BR    14
         END

Translate this program with the NOEPILOG and NOPROLOG
options.


METHOD TWO

Delete program DFHUAKP from group USRMISC (copy from
DFHMISC), replace DFHMISC with USRMISC in your start-
up list (GRPLIST=I), then cold-start the CICS system. The
program DFHUAKP will not be found in the PPT so there will
be no attempt to load it.


METHOD THREE

Remove the link to DFHUAKP through the following
USERMOD (using SMP/E):

//SMPPTFIN DD *
++ USERMOD(DVOMOD0) .
++ VER(C150) FMID(HCI2212) .
++ MACUPD(DFHAKP) DISTLIB(SOURCE) ASSEM(DFHAKP) .
./ CHANGE NAME=DFHAKP
*       DFHPC TYPE=LINK,         LINK TO USER          DVOMOD0 @BD1622P
*             PROGRAM=DFHUAKP,     ...ACTIVITY         DVOMOD0 @BD1622P
*             COND=YES             ...EXIT             DVOMOD0 @BD1622P
./ ENDUP
//SMPCNTL DD *
    SET BDY(GLOBAL) .
  RECEIVE SELECT (DVOMOD0) LIST SYSMODS.
    SET BDY(C21TAA) .
  APPLY SELECT (DVOMOD0) ASSEM .
