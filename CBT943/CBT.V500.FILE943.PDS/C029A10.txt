A friend of mine has found an error in my DL/I-verify program (CICS Update,
January 1988).  His FCT is terminated with an TEND DFHFCTBAU statement and this
caused my program to cancel.  A solution to this problem is to use the value of
register 0 (load address) instead of the register 1 (entry address) after the
CDLOAD for DFHFCTxx.  The code will then work correctly in all cases.
         CDLOAD (1),RETPNF=YES    LOAD CICS/VS FCT
         LTR   R15,R15            CDLOAD OK
         BNZ   ASKOPER            NO, ASK OPERATOR
         LR    R1,R0              <== add this statement

We run VM and then DOS/VSE under VM and would like to run two full production
CICS systems each in a separate DOS machine but with the ability to access and
update the same set of VSAM files.  The problem is file integrity.  Does anyone
have a way to do this without going to MVS?
