Executing master terminal commands in batch

Our operating environment is CICS release 1.7 under MVS/XA.
The very first time that our primary dump dataset filled up I was
surprised to learn that CICS would not automatically switch to the
alternate dataset; a CEMT command is required to effect the
switch.  Since at our company we strive to have as little operator
intervention as possible, I thought I would avoid this problem by
performing the CEMT command automatically at CICS
initialisation time by means of the CRLP 'pseudo-terminal'
facility.

Alas, I was again surprised to learn that this technique would not
work because the CEMT SET DUMP AUTO command is not
supported by the command-level interpreter.  Of course, my
COBOL program that contained this command failed to compile
and I was forced to find another method.

I then realised that the simplest method of accomplishing this task
was to run a batch job which contained an MVS MODIFY
command that would perform the CEMT function.  After all our
CICS systems have been initialised, a batch job is executed that
contains all the CEMT commands required to effect automatic
dump dataset switching in all the CICS address spaces.

The JCL required for this is as follows:

//JS10 EXEC PGM=IEBGENER
//SYSPRINT DD SYSOUT=*
//SYSOUT   DD SYSOUT=*
//SYSIN DD DUMMY
//SYSUT1 DD DATA,DLM=$$
/*@VS,'F CICSPROD,CEMT S DUMP AUTO'
$$
//SYSUT2 DD SYSOUT=(X,INTRDR)
//

Of course, the JES2 console command character that we use (ie
the @ sign) is user-dependent; use whatever character that your
installation has defined as a command character.

Also, merely add subsequent steps that duplicate the above JCL,
changing the CICS name, to perform the switch for all your CICS
systems in one JCL stream.

I realise that there must be various methods to accomplish this
task.  I would be interested to discover how others perform CEMT
commands without actually logging on to CICS and doing them
manually.  Also, I am particularly eager to hear about the uses to
which others have put the batch processing of CICS commands.
