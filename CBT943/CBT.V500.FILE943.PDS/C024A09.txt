 Reader's letter

Referring to Andy Scott's article Timer driven shut-down in CICS Update issue 6,
May 1986, I would like to address the topic of time initiated tasks.  Andy
altered the transaction CSTA, which executes at midnight, to start KOFF in 5
hours.  Another way to start KOFF at 5.00 am would be to issue the following
statement from within a start-up PLT program:

     EXEC CICS START TRANSID('KOFF') TIME(290000)

This will start KOFF at 5 hours after 240000 (ie midnight) thus giving the same
result.  We use the above technique at our installation to release jobs from the
POWER queue early in the morning and have not had any problems.
