Annual award winners

All the votes are now in for the 1990 CICS Update article of
the year awards.

The article that saved readers' installations most money turned
out to be a tie between A poor man's monitor by Robert Bilyeu
(May-July 1990) and VTAM cancelling and bringing down
CICS by Yechezkel Ida (August 1990).  The $2000 prize will
be split between both authors.  On average, both articles saved
all subscribers who sent in a voting paper approximately $70
each P that's equivalent to a total saving of almost $250,000 for
our combined circulation.

The article that saved readers most time was judged to be CICS
year-to-date usage statistics by Mike O'Quinn (September-
October 1990).  The average time saved by all subscribers who
sent in a voting paper was 5.40 hours each P equivalent to a
total saving of well over six man years for our total readership.

CICS Update saves the average subscriber's installation
$2044.92 and 69.64 hours a year.  January's issue saved
readers most money (an average saving of $313.56).
September's issued saved them most time (an average saving of
8.23 hours).

The purpose of these awards, which were introduced last year,
is twofold P to give public recognition to these authors and to
enable us to tailor CICS Update more accurately to the needs of
our subscribers by concentrating more on the types of article
you have indicated are of most benefit to your installations.

now.  Our thanks go to all the readers who took the trouble to
vote.
