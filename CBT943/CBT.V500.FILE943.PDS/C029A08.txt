 Sign-ons, operator-ids, and passwords
If you are among the lucky shops using VSE/SP and CICS with the default VSE/SP
sign-on file instead of the CICS SNT, you might find that the storage needed to
run ICCF exceeds your capacity.  Because ICCF was not used for anything in our
installation except applying service or adding users to the IESCNTL file, I was
able to remove ICCF (and all its associated table entries) from CICS entirely.
However, I ran into some problems:
%    How could I add users without bringing the system down?
%    What would I do if someone forgot their password?
The solution to the first problem was simple.  IBM provides a batch program
(IESBDLUP) to allow updating the IESCNTL file where passwords are kept (however,
you must look at the Planning Manual to see how to use it!).
The solution to the second problem was figuring out how the log-on-ids and
passwords are stored in the file in order to display them.  The following
Assembler program reads all the user records on the IESCNTL file and then
displays the log-on-id, three-character operator-id (which could be accessed
through any command-level program, but is included for completeness), and the
password, which must be decoded before it can be displayed.
Be certain that you use some method of security for this program -you may not
want everyone to know everyone elseUs password!  In my installation, I include a
call to a program called SECURITY (see Checking security bits, CICS Update,
December 1987) to ensure that I am the only one with security to use this
program.  Also, you must either add a PCT entry in addition to a PPT entry, or
you can run this program using CECI, as I do, to make it less likely that a user
will stumble onto it.
No provision was made for a second page of the display;  therefore, if you have
more than 88 log-on-ids, some modification will be required.  This program runs
under VSE/SP 2.1.5 and CICS 1.6, but it should work under CICS 1.7.  Figure 1
shows an example of how the output might appear.
