 Scanning the TCT


INTRODUCTION

The following routine, TCTSCAN, will do one of three things:

1    Return an operator-id and transaction code associated with a specified
terminal.

2    Return a terminal-id and transaction code associated with a specified
operator.

3    Scan the TCT returning one terminal, operator, and transaction code at a
time.

The uses of such a routine are many.  We use it in conjunction with an
electronic mail system to notify a user that they have been sent mail.  We also
use it to broadcast a message to all terminals or to all users who are signed
onto a terminal by scanning the TCT and only sending the message to the terminal
if the operator-id returned is not low values.  A routine such as this would
make it very easy to create a program to display all terminals under CICS, which
user is signed on to which terminal, and what transaction they are using.

We are a VSE/SP 2.1 shop running CICS 1.6.

Below is an example of how to pass information to this routine from a CICS COBOL
program.  You will need to set up a Transaction Work Area (TWA) of 80 bytes for
the transaction being invoked although this could be as small as 15 bytes.  We
set up a standard 80 bytes in case we wanted to return more information than an
operator-id, terminal-id, and a transaction code (eg I/O counts, security
information, terminal status etc).

There is a need to pass 4 bytes to maintain the address of the TCT being
examined.  This address is used when scanning the TCT to show what the previous
terminal-id was.  A blank means that this is the first time through.
