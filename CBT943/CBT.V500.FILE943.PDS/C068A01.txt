A friendlier CEBR

The following article is applicable to an MVS/ESA, CICS
2.1.1 environment.

The IBM-supplied temporary storage browse transaction,
CEBR, allows a user the opportunity to view temporary storage
queues either in character or hexadecimal format.  If an item is
too long for the terminal screen to display, PF9 is activated as a
'scroll right' key.  When a user has reached the end of an item,
PF9 reverses its function and becomes a 'scroll left' key.  This
is the only way to change the scroll direction without
modification to the IBM-supplied source code and can be quite
frustrating in the case of long temporary storage items.

The following modification adds a few lines of code to
program DFHEDFBR and enables an unused PF key (PF12 in
this case) to be used as a 'switch view direction' toggle key for
the operation of PF9.  The source code for DFHEDFBR is
included in the optional materials for CICS 2.1.1 and is a
command-level Assembler program translated from PL/S.  The
PL/S statements that generate the Assembler code appear as
Assembler comments followed by the translation.

If you do not have the optional source materials, they are
available free to licensed customers.  Order feature number
7861 for 6250 bpi tape or feature number 7862 for 3480
cartridge.

The following code fragment will implement PF12's function
as a 'switch view' key.

At line 1559:

@RF00257 DS    0H
         TM    SHIFTR,B'10000000' Is current shift left?
         BZ    @RMS0001           Yes switch to right shift.
         CLC   COLNUM,@CF00070    No, is col. 1 current col?
         BE    @RC00209           Yes, reloop (leave at shift right).
         NI    SHIFTR,B'01111111' No, switch to left shift.
         B     @RC00209           Reloop.
@RMS0001 DS    0H
         OI    SHIFTR,B'10000000' Switch to right shift.
         B     @RC00209           Reloop.
*        LA    @01,@AL00260       Old instruction.
*        BAL   @14,ERR1           Old instruction.

If the current column is one, a 'switch left' request is ignored.

The following code fragment will format the description of
PF12's function if an item is longer than a logical screen.

At line 1027:

@RF00138 DS    0H                     Was TM instruction.
         LA    @02,DFHDBM1I           Load BMS address.
         MVC   PF12MA(1,@02),DFHBMUNP Unprotect attribute.
         MVC   PF12MO(11,@02),=C'SWITCH VIEW' Move literal.
         TM    SHIFTR,B'10000000'     Label removed from col. 1.

Modify the following JCL sample to your site standards and re-
assemble DFHEDFBR:

//      JOB ...
//ASSEM EXEC DFHASMVS,PARM.ASSEM='XREF(SHORT)'
//ASSEM.SYSPUNCH DD DSN=&&OBJECT,DISP=(,PASS),
//           UNIT=SYSDA,SPACE=(CYL,(4,2)),
//           DCB=(RECFM=FB,BLKSIZE=800,LRECL=80)
//ASSEM.SYSIN DD *

modified code goes here

/*
//LNK   EXEC DFHLNKVS,PARM='XREF',COND=(7,LT)
//LNK.SYSLMOD DD DSN=your loadlib,DISP=SHR
//LNK.SYSLIB  DD DSN=CICS211.LOADLIB,DISP=SHR
//LNK.SYSLIN  DD DSN=&&OBJECT,DISP=(OLD,DELETE)
//            DD *
      INCLUDE SYSLIB(DFHEAI)
      INCLUDE SYSLIB(DFHEAI0)
      ORDER DFHEAI,DFHEDFBR
      NAME DFHEDFBR(R)
/*

The two procedures used, DFHASMVS and DFHLNKVS, are
standard procedures delivered with the CICS product.

Please note that the sample JCL above does not overlay the
original DFHEDFBR load module.  However, you must ensure
that DFHEDFBR will be executed from your load library.
