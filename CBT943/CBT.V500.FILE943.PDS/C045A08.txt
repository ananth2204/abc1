CICS clear key modification

Under CICS, when the clear key is pressed and no transaction has
been specified by a previous 'RETURN TRANID(xxxx)', CICS
returns a blank screen.  This is not always convenient to the users.
In most cases, it would be better to display either a menu or a
standard pre-formatted screen of some kind.

The USERMOD shown below will cause transaction CLRK to be
executed if there are no other transactions waiting.  This
USERMOD has run on CICS 1.6.1 and CICS 1.7.0 up to an 8805
PUT level, using VTAM terminals.

The CLRK transaction is able to determine the screen to be
displayed using any criteria required (eg terminal-id, bit settings
in the Terminal User Area, operator-id, etc.)

Remember, if you change any of the registers, you also need to
restore their original contents.  If you use a save area in the
USERMOD that is part of the module, DFHZCP will no longer be
LPA-eligible.
