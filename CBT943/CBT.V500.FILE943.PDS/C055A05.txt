Starting a CICS transaction from a clear screen

When a user hits the ENTER key when a blank screen is presented,
CICS issues the message DFH2001I (invalid transaction
identification).  This is not very user-friendly, so we looked at
ways of improving the situation for our users.

A blank screen can be made to be an infrequent occurrence by
careful transaction design so that a next TRANSID is always set.
However, to cover old applications and also those situations
where a blank screen with no 'next TRANSID' happens, a more
helpful response than message DFH2001I is required.  We also
decided that our menu should be displayed under these
circumstances.

If it were possible to define a transaction name of spaces, a user
program could be invoked in the above situation.  But neither the
DFHPCT macro nor the CEDA transaction allow such a transaction-
id to be specified.  The XTRANID parameter, however, does allow a
hexadecimal character string to be defined which will cause a
task to be attached when this string forms the first four bytes of
the input screen.

An XTRANID string of X'40404040' would do the trick - this is
disallowed via CEDA, but quite valid for the DFHPCT macro.  (We
are running CICS 1.7 at PUT 89.07.)

Not having used a macro-defined PCT for some time, we wanted
to use RDO if possible, so we did the following:

1       We used CEDA ALTER to change the transaction which
       invokes our menu program.

2       We set XTRANID to F9F8F7F6.  (This could be anything valid.)

3       We editted the CSD record for this transaction, changing
       C6F9C6F8C6F7C6F6 ( F 9 F 8 F 7 F 6) to F4F0F4F0F4F0F4F0 (
       4 0 4 0 4 0 4 0).

4       We checked via CEDA that the XTRANID was now set to
       40404040 for this transaction, then installed the group
       containing the transaction.

Hitting the ENTER key at a clear screen will now display the menu
screen.
