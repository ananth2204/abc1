A program to submit a batch job from CICS

An MVS systems programmer called me the other day and
asked how easy it was to write a COBOL program to submit a
three-line batch job from CICS. He desperately needed this
program but his shop had nobody with any amount of expertise
in CICS and, being a large bank, they used CICS heavily. I
thought that there must be many people in the world who might
be in need of such a facility so here is the program I wrote for
him.

If the program is associated with the transaction-id NIRM, you
can simply enter NIRM at a CICS screen. A three-line batch
job will be submitted. These three lines consist of JOB-CARD-
1, JOB-CARD-2, and JOB-CARD-3 as given in the working
storage section of the program. This can easily be changed to
meet your own requirements.

An entry for the extra-partition queue INT1 needs to be defined
in your DCT as follows:

         DFHDCT TYPE=EXTRA,
X
               DESTID=INT1,                                            X
               DSCNAME=IEINTRDR

         other TYPE=EXTRA entries as appropriate

         DFHDCT TYPE=SDSCI,                                            X
               BLKSIZE=80,                                             X
               BUFNO=1,                                                X
               DSCNAME=IEINTRDR,                                       X
               RECSIZE=80,                                             X
               RECFORM=FIXUNB                                          X
               TYPEFLE=OUTPUT

The following line needs to be inserted in the CICS start-up
procedure or JCL:

//IEINTRDR DD  SYSOUT=(Q,INTRDR)
