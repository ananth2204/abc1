 A solution to the CICS print facility problem
In the September 1987 issue of CICS Update an article appeared which was
entitled A problem with the CICS print facility by Kevin Hogan of ASCAP, USA.
In this article Mr Hogan described a method of utilising a PF key to initiate
the CICS software print program DFHPRK, instead of using the PA key that CICS
was designed for.
We ran into the same situation that Mr Hogan did in that our users wanted to
take advantage of the CICS print facility but our PA1 and PA2 keys were already
used as an integral part of our CICS applications.
We solved this problem by changing the DFHSIT macro to allow a particular PF key
to be specified in the PRINT parameter of the DFHSIT assembly statements.  The
PRINT parameter portion of the DFHSIT macro before our change was:
********************************************************************** 63940000
*       PROCESS PRINT= PARAMETER                                       64000000
********************************************************************** 64060000
        DFHPRMCK  PRINT,&PRINT,0,S,,,(NO,00),                         *64120000
              (PA1,6C),(PA2,6E),(PA3,6B),(YES,FF)             @BBAL02X 64180000
The same portion of the DFHSIT macro after our change:
********************************************************************** 63940000
*      PROCESS PRINT= PARAMETER                                        64000000
********************************************************************** 64060000
       DFHPRMCK  PRINT,&PRINT,0,S,,,(NO,00),                          *64120000
             (PA1,6C),(PA2,6E),(PA3,6B),(PF12,7C),(YES,FF)    @BBAL02X 64180000
As you can see we chose to add the PF12 key as a candidate on the PRINT
parameter in the DFHSIT macro.  Next, we simply assembled the DFHSIT statements
with the PRINT parameter, as shown below.  The PF12 key will invoke the CSPK
transaction after the next CICS start-up:
             PRINT=PF12,             REQUEST KEY FOR 3270 PRINTOUT    X
