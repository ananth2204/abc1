 Automatic sign-off program
EditorUs note: The problem of users signing on to CICS and then leaving their
terminals unattended was addressed in the very first issues of CICS Update.  In
the following article, the problem is re-examined partly for the benefit of new
readers  but also to take a fresh approach to its solution.
INTRODUCTION
Our operating environment is CICS 1.6 and VSE/SP2.1.  Our purpose was to ensure
a signed-on terminal is signed off if it is not in use.  At any terminal that
has not been used for 15 minutes (the interval may be modified to the userUs
needs) two events occur:
1    The existing screen is erased and replaced by a message stating, TYour
terminal has not been used for 15 minutesU.
2    A CSGM transaction will be started at that terminal to enforce re-
initiating the sign-on program; because of the BMS routing mechanism delay the
comment screen overlays the sign-on screen.
The program skips printers by skipping terminals with the number of input
messages equal to zero.  Terminals that are already executing the sign-on
program are also left alone.  Terminals that were signed off are considered as
executing the sign-off program unless they have been re-used since sign-off.
Because we warm-start our CICS system the program is started by a program in the
PLT;  that program ensures the discontinuation of the previous sessionUs sign-
off transaction and the starting up of another.  If it encounters any
difficulties it sends a message to the operator console by starting a
transaction named MESC.
