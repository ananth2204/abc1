The SEGMENT option in DFHDUP

CICS 1.7 introduced a useful new parameter for the CICS Print
Dump Utility, DFHDUP.  With the parameter SEGMENT=lst-
class, every dump in the dump dataset is segmented into one
LST queue entry.  Every dump is given a name consisting of
transaction-id and dump-id.  If transaction CSSN abended with
an ASRA abend, the name will be CSSNASRA.  This is very
useful if you want to prevent unwanted dumps from printing or
you want only one dump.  DFHDUP uses the POWER
SEGMENT macro to do this.  Unfortunately the LST queue
entries are not given an FCB nor an FNO.

Because we need this parameter for CICS dumps and an FCB
cannot be altered with the PALTER command, I wrote the
following ZAP.  If you use it please check whether the
addresses fit your version of DFHDUP.  Do a LIBR-LIST of
DFHDUP.PHASE in PRD1.BASE.  On the last page you will
find the POWER list card beginning with '* $$ LST
DISP=HI'  The address of the first X'40' in this card is the
address of the first ALTER.  Add X'10' to get the second
address.

I added the following parameters to the list card:

      I,FCB=FCBA4H,FNO=A4HB

The list card is always 71 bytes long - don't exceed this!
