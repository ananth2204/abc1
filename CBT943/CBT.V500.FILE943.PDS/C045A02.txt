Using SDF to define arrays

The REPEAT STRUCTURE command can be used in SDF to
define an array of structures.  This is useful because fields in a
map can be subscripted.  Figure 1 shows an example of a map
where this technique can be used:

Unfortunately REPEAT STRUCTURE can only be used to repeat
one line.  In Figure 2, two lines repeat so we cannot form an array
of structures.

However, CICS allows the sequence of field definition to be
different from the sequence of fields in the map.  This means that
we can form arrays where the fields in the array are not
contiguous.  As long as the fields have the same name, length,
and attributes, they can be formed into an array.  This saves time
and effort when defining the map in SDF, and also when COBOL
coding since the map fields can be subscripted.

The SDF steps are as follows:

1   Define the first two lines of the repeated section as normal,
then use &COPY with FROM and TO to repeat the lines (in
this case seven times).  You only have to mark the FROM
and TO lines once, and using & before the COPY means that
you only have to move the cursor down and press 'enter' each
time.

2   Go to the Application Structure Specification screen (option
6).  As an example we will define the two character field at
the beginning of each set of two lines which has the name
MAP-CATGROUP.  Enter the command &NAME MAP-
CATGROUP(1).  Now by moving the cursor to each of the
eight fields and pressing 'enter' each time, we will define an
array.  The subscript is automatically incremented by SDF.
Don't forget that even if the map has a prefix set (eg MAP-),
you still have to code it in the &NAME command.  The result
of this work can be seen in the Application Structure Review
screen as shown in Figure 3.
