Speeding up CICS start-up time

Our environment is CICS 1.7 and VSE/SP 3.2.0.  We make
extensive use of VSAM Local Resources (LSR) and have about
300 VSAM datasets in our LSR pool.  Every day at CICS start-
up time we experienced a considerable delay and were able to
attribute much of this to the time CICS was taking to build the
LSR pool (about 5 minutes in our case).  We were able to
deduce the cause of this which turned out to be very simple.

If you do not define the KEYLEN parameter in your SHRCTL
macro, CICS has to search all the VSAM catalogs to find the
longest key for the LSR pool.  Obviously, this can take a lot of
time, especially if you have many VSAM datasets in your LSR
pool.  We found that by coding the KEYLEN parameter, CICS
will not use more than a second to build the LSR pool.
By taking a look at your CICS statistics, searching for the
maximum key length used in your LSR pool, and coding this
value in the KEYLEN parameter of the SHRCTL macro, you
may be able to make a significant improvement in the speed of
your CICS start-up.
