 CICS 1.7 DCT warm start local modification
CICS Release 1.7 dropped support for warm starting the DCT during a cold-started
CICS initialisation.  Because of this new feature, all intra-partition queues
not processed are lost.  To address this situation a local modification
(LMWRMDCT) was developed to facilitate a warm DCT start when CICS is cold-
started.  This article illustrates the implementation steps and testing
procedures for functionally restoring warm DCT starts for a CICS 1.7 system.
Two assumptions for applying this modification have been made.  They are:
1    Not every CICS region may require this feature.
2    SMP/E was not used as the vehicle to apply this modification.
Implementation of LMWRMDCT requires two pre-allocated partitioned datasets:
CICS.SPECIAL.MACLIB and CICS. SPECIAL.LOADLIB (the names may vary).  These will
contain macro and load module entries respectively.  The following six steps are
required to install LMWRMDCT:
1    Copy DFHSIT macro from CICS.MACLIB into CICS. SPECIAL.MACLIB.
2    Change DFHSIT macro parameters at statement 34000000 from COLD,COLDEX to
WARM,WARMX.
3    Assemble SIT with SUFFIX=99 (or a suffix of your choice).  The assembly
procedure must specify CICS.SPECIAL. MACLIB first in the SYSLIB concatenation.
4    Copy DFHSID1 from CICS.SOURCE into CICS.SPECIAL. MACLIB.
5    Apply these changes to DFHSID1 at the statement numbers shown:
         TM    SITDCTOP,WARMEX   DCT=(...WARM) ?    @LMWRMDCT 10530000
         BO    TDWARMST          ...YES, WARM START @LMWRMDCT 10540000
         SPACE 1                                    @LMWRMDCT 10550000
6    Assemble DFHSID1 by first performing a stage 1 generation to produce a
stage 2 deck.  Next, assemble DFHSID1 (concatenate CICS.SPECIAL.MACLIB first in
SYSLIB) and directly link-edit module into CICS.SPECIAL.LOADLIB.
To facilitate the testing of LMWRMDCT, a special CICS system (in our case EXP1)
should be used.  DFHRPL must specify CICS. SPECIAL.LOADLIB first in the
concatenation order.  The following is a list of various CICS initialisations
which should be performed to verify all operational considerations:
1    Initialise the EXP1 system with START=COLD in the SIT.  After
initialisation is complete, write 15 transient data queue records.  The easiest
method for doing this is to issue a CECI command using these parameters:
     CECI EXEC CICS WRITEQ TD QUEUE(WRMD) FROM(&DATA)
     The purpose of this exercise is to have a transient data queue staged which
can be verified during step two.  To confirm that queue WRMD exists, use a
monitor (eg OMEGAMON/CICS) or a debugging tool (eg INTERTEST).  Shut down EXP1
and prepare for the next step.
2    Initialise the EXP1 system with START=COLD using the modified SIT with the
DCT=(99,WARM) parameter.  After initialisation verify the WRMD queue exists
using the same method employed in step one.  If WRMD exists, consider the
modification has been successful.  Shut down EXP1 and prepare for next step.
3    Initialise the EXP1 system with START=AUTO, using the modified SIT with the
DCT=(99,WARM) parameter.  After initialisation, verify the WRMD queue exists
again using the method employed in step one.  This start-up ensures that the
modification works during a warm initialisation.  Shut down EXP1 and prepare for
the next step.
4    To clear the intra-partition transient data queue, specify DCT=(99,COLD) as
an override parameter during a START=AUTO or START=COLD CICS initialisation.
This local modification illustrates how to to re-instate function into Release
1.7, which was available in prior releases.  Although this modification may not
be applicable to every installation, it will provide intra-partition transient
data queue integrity during CICS cold starts.
