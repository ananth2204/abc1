 Reader's letter

I must take issue with Moyeen Ahmed Khan (Generating your own symbolic maps,
issue 19, June 1987).  It is true, as he states (and the IBM manual shows), that
creating your own symbolic map is easy and that there are several benefits to
the method.  But, there is one major disadvantage that Moyeen neglected to
mention, namely maintenance.

His procedure will increase the cost of program and map maintenance.  Usually,
the majority of BMS modifications are the relocation of screen fields or the
adjustment to a screen field's size.  Using Moyeen's method of hand writing the
symbolic map, a programmer must always go to the program as well as the map to
make the changes as opposed to just recompiling the program after the map has
been modified.  Also, if the original programmer moves on, everyone must
remember that the symbolic map is not copied into the program and was not
created in a standard way.

A better method to use is to create a program (or procedure) that re-processes
the symbolic output with better data names as shown in Figure 1.  This method
permits a company to standardise and enforce the naming conventions (via the
program or procedure) while establishing the whole process as a programming
standard (hence, reducing maintenance and programmer intervention).

These re-processors have been written as TSO CLISTs, ROSCOE ROSPROCS, batch
programs, and CICS transactions.  They are a preferable solution because of the
maintenance problem created.
