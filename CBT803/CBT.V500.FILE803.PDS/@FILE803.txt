//***FILE 803 is from Lionel Dyck and contains a collection of      *   FILE 803
//*           ISPF macros that he used to use in the past, and      *   FILE 803
//*           which were very worth while keeping.  Lionel is       *   FILE 803
//*           not the author of these macros--he ran across them    *   FILE 803
//*           in his travels, and used them in programming over     *   FILE 803
//*           the years.  Now, he found them and wants to put       *   FILE 803
//*           them out for everyone to benefit from.                *   FILE 803

//*           Now included is member $MACDOC from the original      *   FILE 803
//*           author of the macros, courtesy of Lionel.             *   FILE 803
