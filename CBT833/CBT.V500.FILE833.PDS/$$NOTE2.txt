Sam!

Here is a bit modified version of LABELS. (It is member LABELS1 here.)

I thought that would be nice to use unclosed version of table,
which still resides in virtual storage. After we leave EDIT we
lose all labels but not this table. Next time we open EDIT, we
could reuse this table again. Now it works.

With best wishes,
