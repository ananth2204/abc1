Explanation of Labels system

The matter is that I often use a lot of labels during my
exploration of COBOL texts. But I forget the meanings of my
labels all over the time. When I continue with the same text next
day, I must give new labels  Oh, It is hard enough.

So I developed this utility. It is something like notepad for
labels.

First of all, I can see all my labels. And (sic!) I can enter
comment for every label.

Then I can save this table in special library and use it next
day.

I can move label on the another line and comment will be moved
too.

I have tested this for some days and it seems it works as I need.

I d like to know your opinion about this facility. I ll be glad
if you like it too.

In archive you may find:

ISRTSO     - it is screen to addition to ISRTSOA that
             I ve sent previous (expanded TSO Command Shell).
LAID000    - it is main screen (43 lines and more) of Label Aid.
LAID00S    - the same for screens less than 43 lines.
LIADTL0    - select table screen.
LABELS     - macro.
LABELS1    - variation of the macro.
LAIDUG     - short User Guide.

You may remove  LUXOFT  from screen title if you like.
