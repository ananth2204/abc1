Hello Ted, Sam & Sam,

Thank you very much for your work for CBT !

I have downloaded yesterday the File 726, which
generates the define cluster cards for a VSAM file.
To do this, a REXX procedure was developped, whose
name is VC.

I have found some misfits in my environment, but they
are all corrected by a simple way...which i had some
difficulties to find and understand !

The VC REXX suppose that the generated line "INDEXED"
is the 7th and that the generated line "SHAREOPTION"
is the 8th. (Lines code 84 and 85.

Later in the routine, there are some lines with these
hardcoded line numbers :
line 264 : out_line.8 = xxxxxxx
line 279, 282, 285 : out_line.7 = xxxxxxx
wich overides the initial values.

In my environment, INDEXED line is 3, and SHAREOPTION
line = 4 .... and this little difference makes big
effects on the define cluster which is generated !
After understanding this, it seems that the procedure
works well. I have change the procedure a little bit :
i keep these two line number in two variables :
ilineindex and ilineshare.  (see line 85 and 87)

And later in the code, i have replaced    out_line.7
by out_line.ilineindex   and out_line.8 by
out_line.ilineshare

These line numbers are no more hardcoded in the code !
!

You can find the new code in the member VCP.

Excuse my english, i speak english as if i were a
french boy...

Thank you very much for your work !
Kindest regards,
Philippe
