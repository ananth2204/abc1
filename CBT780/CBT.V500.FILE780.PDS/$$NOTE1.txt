Hi Sam!

Recently I needed to use panels in REXX without ISPF interface. I
have developed a small driver to use TPUT/TGET macros and Rexx
variable service (IKJCT441).  This is a simple contribution, I
hope that to be published.

Following the $$DOC member from CBT xmit :

Hi everyone,

This is a small driver to use TPUT/TGET macro under REXX
language.  The RX3270 can be used to build a 3270 datastream
under TSO sessions.

There are some REXX variable to interface with RX3270 :

RX3270_INMAP  (input buffer, basically a 3270 datastream)
RX3270_OUTPUT (output buffer, needs a parse fields)
RX3270_AID    (exception key, for example, ENTER, PFxx, PAx and
              CLEAR)

The RXMAPR member from CBT xmit is small sample to use the
function.
