Hi everyone,

This is a small driver to use TPUT/TGET macro under REXX language.
The RX3270 can be used to build a 3270 datastream under TSO sessions.

There are some REXX variable to interface with RX3270 :

RX3270_INMAP (input buffer, basically a 3270 datastream)
RX3270_OUTPUT (output buffer, needs a parse fields)
RX3270_AID (exception key, for example, ENTER, PFxx, PAx and CLEAR)

The RXMAPR member from CBT xmit is small sample to use the function.
