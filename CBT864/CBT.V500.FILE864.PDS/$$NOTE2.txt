Sam,

This is an update for my UNIX utilities.  There are some fairly
"hefty" changes to "lsdasd" in that I've added some options and
have split the main UCB scan logic into a separate program,
finducb, which is a DLL.  This allows it to act more like a z/OS
dynamic subroutine instead of being statically linked into the
program object.  I have also split the LSPACE subroutine out of
the lsdasd.s source file into a separate lspace.s source file
which allowed me to make LSPACE a DLL also.  I have also made the
documentation for lsdasd and the new finducbs DLL in what I hope
is a better UNIX man format. I have included the "troff" source
as well as the "troff" formatted output.  Both are in the proper
file structure to be processed by the z/OS man command.
