zccCICS - Batch CICS Resource Management
========================================

zccCICS utilize CPSM to enable management of CICS resources from a batch
job.

This utility require a CMAS running CICS Transaction Server 5.3. If you
are running with a older CMAS contact me and I will see what I can do
to help.

The output from this utility will present the reason and response codes
  when the CPSM API is used. These codes are documented in the IBM CPSM
CICSPlex SM Application Programming Reference manual. I will not
reproduce this documentation and if you have non-zero reason codes you
should reference this manual for explanations of the received error.
