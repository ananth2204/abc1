The LOAD library contain an additional program called BR14PLUS. Consider
this a hidden pineapple as it is not really used in zccCICS.

It is basically an enhanced IEFBR14 program that allows you to set a
return code based on the value you pass to the program in the job PARM.

Below is a usage example. You pass a parm in the JCL and
the specific step will end with that return code. If no parameter is
pass the step will simply end with RC 0.

//DOTRN  EXEC PGM=BR14PLUS,PARM=1.

Or you can set it with a symbolic overide:

//DOTRN  EXEC PGM=BR14PLUS,PARM=&DOXXX.

This little program is very useful if you have procedures with many
steps and from the invoking JCL you want to control if a certain step
 will be execured.

Here is a procedure example. The setting by default will not execute
STP1.

//HAPPY PROC ,
//   DOSTP1=0                0 = DO NOT DO STP1 / 1 = DO IT
//* ......
//DOSTP1  EXEC PGM=BR14PLUS,PARM=&DOSTP1.
//STEPLIB  DD  DISP=SHR,DSN=ZCCCICS.LOAD
//*
//         IF DOSTP1.RC = 01 THEN
//STP1     EXEC PGM=IEFBR14
//         ENDIF

Now in the invoking JCL you can invoke this proc like this to set
the switch to make this step execute.

//STEP0000 EXEC HAPPY,
//         DOSTP1=1            /* 0 = NO BIND; 1 = DO BIND */


I use this program to reduce the number of PROCs I have. Instead of
having many procedures with lots of combinations of different steps I
will have one proc and with switches I can force certain steps in the
procedure to be executed. This program with nested JCL IF logic provide
 great fexibility in how your procedures executes.

Enjoy your pineapples.
