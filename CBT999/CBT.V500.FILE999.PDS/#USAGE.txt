zccCICS - Usage Guide
=====================

Introduction
============
zccCICS utilize CPSM to determine where resources exist in your CICSPlex
and then process the SYSIN instructions to alter the selected resource
state based on the provided commands. zccCICS require a CONTEXT and
SCOPE defined to determine the CICS environment the commands should be
directed too.

CONTEXT and SCOPE can be defined in the JOB PARM statement or in the
SYSIN. Use the PARM option to set defaults when using a company wide
procedure to simplify usage and potentially limit mistakes when pointing
the SYSIN to incorrect environments.

From a CPSM perspective CONTEXT is used to select a CICSPLEX where these
commands should be directed too, and SCOPE is used to select a group
of CICS regions as defined by the CICS systems programmers. SCOPE could
also be just one CICS region instead of a group of regions.

The STEPLIB must include the follwing CICSPlex SM datasets in
   addition to the load library containing zccCICS.
   hlq.SEYUAUTH
   hlq.SEYULOAD

zccCICS will end with the following codes:

Return Code 0
    No errors or bad return codes experienced

Return Code 4
    No errors received, but some resources in CICS did have
    a non zero CICSPlex return code. Review SYSPRINT for the
    reason for the non-zero code.

Return Code 8
    A error was received that needs to be fixed.
    Review SYSPRINT for the reason for the non-zero code.


JOB PARM Syntax
===============
JOB PARM Syntax notation:
PARM='parm=valueÝ,parm=value¨'
     Ý¨ is optional settings
     Maximum 100 characters allowed



Parameters
----------

CONTEXT=
   Set the required CICSPlex CONTEXT for commands

SCOPE=
   Set the required CICSPlex SCOPE for commands

TRACE=
   Allowed trace levels are 0, 1, and 2
   Only use this option when instructed to do so.



SYSIN Syntax
============

SYSIN Syntax notation:
resource_type,resource_name,statusÝ,status...¨
   -or-
CONTEXT,context_value
   -or-
SCOPE,scope_value

    > Ý¨ is optional settings
    > resource_name
      The resource name can be a fully qualified name or a wildcard
      value using an *.
      Example DFH*
    > status
      Can be any of the supported values associated with the defined
      resource

      Status values can be defined using the full name or an abbreviated
      value. If the respective resource types the status values will be
      documented with UPPERCASE and lowercase values. The UPPERCASE
      value is the minimum required data to describe the respective
      status command.

CONTEXT
-------
Define the CPSM CONTEXT value.

SCOPE
-----
Define the CPSM SCOPE value. CONTEXT need to be set before SCOPE is
defined.

FILE - resource type
--------------------
Valid status options for FILE:
    OPEN
    CLOSE
    ENABLE
    DISABLE

Example:
FILE,ABCD,CLO,DIS
    Close and disable file ABCD in the CONTEXT / SCOPE combination

FILE,AB*,ENA
    Enable all files starting with AB* in the CONTEXT / SCOPE
    combination

FGRP - FILE Group Processing
----------------------------
The FGRP command is used to get a list of files to process from
a BAS (Business Application Services) resource group.

Before this funtion is invoked ensure the CONTEXT and SCOPE
is set. CONTEXT is used to identify the CICSPLEX where the resource
group exist, and CONTEXT and SCOPE will be used to determine in which
CICS regions the files need to be processed.

The processing is simular to the FILE command and all the FILE
options are supported in the group processing for files

Example:
FGRP,GRP1,OPE,ENA

    This command extract the files from the GRP1 BAS resource group
    and will open, enable then in all the regions as defined in the
    CONTEXT and SCOPE.


PIPE(line) - resource type
--------------------------
Valid status options for PIPE
    SCAN
    ENAble
    DISable

Example:
PIPE,WEBAPP1,SCAN          <- Perform a pipeline scan on pipeline
                              WEBAPP1

PROG(ram) - resource type
-------------------------
Valid status options for PROG
    NEWCopy
    PHASEin
    ENAble
    DISable

Example:
PROG,PAY0001,NEWC          <- Newcopy program PAY0001
PROG,PAY*,NEWC             <- Newcopy all programs starting with PAY

PGRP - Program Group Processing
-------------------------------
The PGRP command is used to get a list of program to process from
a BAS (Business Application Services) resource group.

Before this funtion is invoked ensure the CONTEXT and SCOPE
is set.

The processing is simular to the PROG command and all the PROGrams
options are supported in the group processing for programs

Example:
PGRP,APP1,PHASEIN          <- Extract all program definitions from
                              BAS group APP1 and perform a PHASEIN

    This command will extract all the program definitions from
    BAS group APP1 and perform a PHASEIN on these files in the
    specified CONTEXT and SCOPE.

TRAN(action) - resource type
----------------------------
Valid status options for TRAN
    ENAble
    DISable

Example:
TRAN,ABCD,ENA

    Enable transaction ABCD in all CICS regions included the the
    specified CONTEXT and SCOPE.

TRAN,CL*,DIS

    Disable all transactions starting with CL in the specified
    CONTEXT and SCOPE.

TGRP - Transaction group Processing
-----------------------------------
The TGRP command is used to get a list of program to process from
a BAS (Business Application Services) resource group.

Before this funtion is invoked ensure the CONTEXT and SCOPE
is set.

The processing is simular to the TRAN command and all the TRANsaction
options are supported in the group processing command.

Example:
TGRP,TGRP1,DIS

    This command will extract all the TRANSACTION definitions from
    BAS group TGRP1 and perform a DISABLE on these transactions in the
    specified CONTEXT and SCOPE.


URI  - URIMAP Processing
------------------------
The URI command is used to process URIMAP sub-commands.

Before this funtion is invoked ensure the CONTEXT and SCOPE
is set.

Valid sub-commands:
DISP | DISPLAY    -> Display URIMAP data

Example:
URI,*,DISP
    This command will display all URIMAP entries for the selected
    CONTEXT and SCOPE.

URI,P2*,DISP
    This command will display URIMAP entries filtering only
    to display uri entries starting with P2* in the selected
    CONTEXT and SCOPE.

TCP  - TCPIP Service Processing
-------------------------------
The TCP command is used to process TCPIP SERVICE sub-commands.

Before this funtion is invoked ensure the CONTEXT and SCOPE
is set.

Valid sub-commands:
DISP | DISPLAY    -> Display TCPIP service data

Example:
TCP,*,DISP
    This command will display all TCPIP entries for the selected
    CONTEXT and SCOPE.

URI,T2*,DISP
    This command will display TCPIP entries filtering only
    to display entries starting with T2* in the selected
    CONTEXT and SCOPE.
