Sam,

Reviewing my SMP/E USERMODs and ISPF DTL I decided I could give
adequate explanation to the end user on how to make the changes
necessary; so, I removed all the possible Copyright issues. I
also pulled the latest version of PLPISPF from Lionel's website
and merged that into the XMIT file.

I have also added a first draft of documentation that should
allow the user to get a sample Dynamic ISPF Environment up for
personal testing. This would require no changes that could not be
done by ANY ISPF/TSO User! So, no APF Programs (no compiled
programs at all), no TSO LOGON PROC Changes, no global options,
and no exploiting anything security would question. I have also
included draft versions of my Techie PDF Documentation as well so
they can explore implementing beyond the personal level.

Then next updates will mostly be to the documentation, both to
the personal testing and the group/shop rollout documents. But I
think this can get people started, and may result in useful
feedback so I can improve the documentation and/or the other
pieces.

Thanks again for maintaining CBTTape.org.
