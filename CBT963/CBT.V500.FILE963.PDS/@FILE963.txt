//*   What is Dynamic ISPF?                                         *   FILE 963
//*   Dynamic ISPF is a method of utilizing the ISPF Environment    *   FILE 963
//*   that allocates as many ISPF/TSO resource as possible only     *   FILE 963
//*   when they are needed. In most cases, the standard ISPF &      *   FILE 963
//*   TSO Library types, and their elements, are dynamically        *   FILE 963
//*   allocated just prior to launching a particular application    *   FILE 963
//*   or function; and then deallocated on exiting it.              *   FILE 963
//*                                                                 *   FILE 963
