                   Installing & Configuring this File

 1. Start with $$README ... then proceed
 2. NOTE: There are no APF Authorized programs (in fact, no compiled
    programs at all); so this implimentation can NOT do anything that
    any ISPF/TSO User could do themselves (if they knew about it).

 3. RECEIVE the following XMIT Members by doing one of the following:
    - From CMD Line:   TSO EXEC 'This.Pds.Name($XREC)'
    - From DSLIST:     EXEC /($XREC)      <=== on this DSN Line
    - From MemList:    EXEC_____ $XREC    <=== EXEC on $XREC Mbr Line
    It will create PDSes of the format 'This.Pds.Name.Member', i.e.
    the RECEIVEd DSNs will have the member/type affixed to the DSN you
    started with.
 4. Do a binary download of the following PDF members to your work
    station, affixing the ".pdf" suffix to them:  PDFPS, PDFUSE, PDF1, &
    PDF2.

 5. Copy the ....PLP.TABLE to an appropriate library for testing.
    (possibly &SYSUID..PLP.TABLE)
 6. Update ....PLP.EXEC(PLPISPF) to point at your new PLP.TABLE (e.g.
    set the plpispf_table value to &SYSUID..PLP.TABLE)
 7. Update ....EXEC(DYNMISPF) to point to your shops standard ISPF/TSO
    libraries. Leave product libraries out, they are taken care of
    dynamically by PLP.

 8. Copy the none $$LIST Members:
    ....EXEC to a SYSEXEC Library        (possibly &SYSUID..Z.EXEC)
    ....ISPPLIB to an ISPPLIB Library    (possibly &SYSUID..ISPF.ISPPLIB)
    ....ISPTLIB to an ISPTLIB Library    (possibly &SYSUID..ISPF.ISPTLIB)
    ....PLP.EXEC to a SYSEXEC Library    (possibly &SYSUID..Z.EXEC)
    ....PLP.PANELS to an ISPPLIB Library (possibly &SYSUID..ISPF.ISPPLIB)

 9. Assuming you have updated ....EXEC(DYNMISPF) and/or are using the
    suggested personal libraries; add the following to your TSO LOGON
    Screen's "Command ===>" line:
    EXEC '&SYSUID..Z.EXEC(DYNMISPF)' EXEC
10. Logon and give Dynamic ISPF a try.

11. Update, add, and delete PLP options as appropriate for your shop.
    see PLPISPF Documentation for details
12. Update, add, and delete ISPF Primary Panel options for your shop.
    - Either by editing the &SYSUID..ISPF.ISPPLIB(ISR@PRIM)' panel
      directly.
      ... or ...
    - By editting & compiling the ISPF Primary Panel DTL in ....ISPGLIB.
