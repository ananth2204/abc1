Hello Sam,

You might want to delete FILE800 and FILE808 ( UNXMIT for PC )
from the CBT tape; they are now heavily outdated.  I rewrote a
new version almost from scratch.  I made it available at

https://bitbucket.org/herc4mac/hercules-cookbook

together with some other snippets used for my Hercules environment.


cheers
Enrico
