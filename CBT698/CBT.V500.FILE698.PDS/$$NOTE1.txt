Sam,

Would you please look this over to see if it is worth putting on
the CBT Tape?

This is a system to load RACF information into a PostgreSQL
database on a Linux system.

The file is a TSO XMIT of a PDS (LRECL=80 RECFM=FB) which
contains six members. The first is a documentation member named
$DOC. The second, HASX20B, is a JES2 exit 20 program which is
optional.  This program puts a "unique identifier" in the SMFxUIF
fields so that records can be related to each other.  The third,
IRRADU00, is sample JCL to run the IRRADU00 program, which creates
RACF activity records in a format which can be downloaded and put
into PostgreSQL.  The fourth, IRRDBU00, is sample JCL to run the
IRRDBU00 utility which creates a sequential file containing most
of the information in the RACF database in a format which can be
downloaded and put into PostgreSQL.  The last is named TARFILE and
contains an XMIT of a z/OS sequential file (LRECL=1 RECFM=FB).
This sequential file is a "tar" archive containing a number
Linux/UNIX files.
