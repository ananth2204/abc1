//***FILE 698 is from John McKown and contains a system to do       *   FILE 698

//*           Perl and PostgreSQL.  This package emulates DB2       *   FILE 698

//*     1. $DOC     - This member, which contains the basic         *   FILE 698
//*                   documentation                                 *   FILE 698
//*     2. HASX20B  - This member is a JES2 exit which puts a       *   FILE 698
//*                   value in the JCTUSEID field of the $JCT.      *   FILE 698
//*                   This is then placed in all of the SMF         *   FILE 698
//*                   records generated by this job, in the         *   FILE 698
//*                   SMFnUIF field.                                *   FILE 698
//*     3. IRRADU00 - This member is example JCL to create the      *   FILE 698
//*                   RACF activity records to be sent to your      *   FILE 698
//*                   Linux system.                                 *   FILE 698

//*                   to your Linux system.                         *   FILE 698
//*     5. RECEIVE  - The basic JCL to create the file which is     *   FILE 698
//*                   to be ftp'ed to the Linux system and then     *   FILE 698
//*                   ftp that file to the Linux system.            *   FILE 698
//*                   This member must be customized as             *   FILE 698
//*                   described therein.                            *   FILE 698
//*     6. TARFILE  - This member contains the output of an XMIT    *   FILE 698
//*                   command.  This member must be RECEIVE'd       *   FILE 698
//*                   (see RECEIVE member) in order to create a     *   FILE 698
//*                   sequential file. This sequential file must    *   FILE 698
//*                   then be binary ftp'ed to the Linux system     *   FILE 698
//*                   upon which the system will run. This          *   FILE 698
//*                   sequential file is the output from a tar      *   FILE 698
//*                   command, run on Linux, which was binary       *   FILE 698
//*                   ftp'ed to a z/OS system. Don't bother         *   FILE 698
//*                   trying to read it, it looks like binary       *   FILE 698
//*                   junk.                                         *   FILE 698
//*                                                                 *   FILE 698
