Introduction:
  This application supports PDSE V2 member generations and is based on the full
  function Lionel B. Dyck PDSEGEN dialog.  PGLITE is a simpler version, or
  subset, of PDSEGEN.

  This table application demonstrates the use of ISPF Dynamic Areas.  Benchmark
  tests have shown dynamic area tables can be up to 10x faster than ISPF tables.

  This dialog is self-contained.  All the panels, execs, and object text are
  included in the driver exec, PGLITE.

Tips:
  When invoking PDSEGEN via the BIG primary command, you can stack
  a PDSEGEN primary command by using the ISPF command delimiter, the
  semicolon.  For example,

    BIG filter;Dataset Command

  Dataset Commands:
      BACkup   RESTore   COPy   MODel   Prune

PDSEGEN Backup Dataset Notes:
  Edit and View on a PDSEGEN backup member (@000000n) will fire the
  GNAME Edit macro to display the real member name and generation
  number in a NOTELINE.  The REAL command will display the real
  member names and generations in the GenNum and Created columns of
  the member list display.

Mods:
<ISREDDE2 mod to display Gen: number in title - optional>
/*  Add to end of )INIT section  */
IF (&gen = '')
ELSE
   IF (&zmemb ¬= ' ') &ztitle =  '&zdsn(&zmemb) Gen: &gen'
   IF (&zmemb  = ' ') &ztitle =  '&zdsn'
</ISREDDE2 mod>
