 Please use source for either LOOKN, LOOKJ or LOOK02 to assemble
 LOOK.  LOOKN is the 64-bit version (the latest (and greatest?)).

 The newest version of LOOK is called LOOKN, and it is the 64-bit
  version.  With it, you can examine storage above the bar.

 If you don't mind the program always having to be APF authorized,
  then use LOOKJ.  It is more reliable.  The old LOOK does not
  have to be authorized, if you are only looking at storage in
  your own address space.  But it is subject to S0C4 abends,
  at least when running on newer z/OS systems.

 After z/OS version 2.4 and including 2.4, you will HAVE TO USE
  either LOOKJ or LOOKN, because the earlier versions of LOOK
  allocate user key common storage, which is not allowed at
  z/OS 2.4 or later.

 See members LOOKJ$ or LOOK02$ for assembly-linkedit JCL.

 If VSM ALLOWUSERKEYCSA(NO) is coded in your DIAGxx PARMLIB member,
  then you will have to either code VSM ALLOWUSERKEYCSA(YES),
  or disable the NO setting temporarily using the UKEYCSA Y
  invocation of the UKEYCSA (APF-authorized) TSO command, which is
  included in this pds.  (This will no longer work from z/OS 2.4
  onwards--people will not be able to allocate user key CSA from
  then on.)

 The current version of LOOKJ does not obtain user key CSA, and it
  therefore can run when VSM ALLOWUSERKEYCSA(NO) is set in DIAGxx,
  and it should be able to work on z/OS 2.4.
