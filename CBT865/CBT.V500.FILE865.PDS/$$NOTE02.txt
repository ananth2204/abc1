             Short set of notes.  Please add to this.

   MINIZIP and MINIUNZ (unzip) are C-language programs ported to MVS.
   The compiler used to port these programs is JCC from Jason Winter,
   which produces Assembler-language output.  So therefore, no C
   run-time libraries are required to run these programs.

   On the MVS platform, we have had to "discover" JCL which works.
   This was done largely by Belinda Tinsley.  Thanks, Belinda.

   Input is via DD name, which is fed into the program with a PARM.

   For MINIZIP, you can feed many input files in, to be zipped to
   one output file.  For MINIUNZ, the output file has to be a pds,
   and the individual zipped files will be loaded as members of the
   output pds.  So far, that's what we've gotten to.  I think that
   SYSUT1 is a work area, and increasing its size might increase the
   capacity of the program to handle larger files, but we don't know
   that for sure at this time.

   For now, it appears that the usefulness of this program is for a
   shop that has to handle zipped files on an MVS (z/OS) system and
   can't afford, or doesn't want to have to "trial" one of the
   expensive zipping/unzipping programs that are sold for MVS.
