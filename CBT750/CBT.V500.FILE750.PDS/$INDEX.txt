ISPFINI -- ISPF Start Up REXX EXEC (Multiple Screens)
           NOTE:  For this REXX EXEC to work properly (seamlessly) you
           should change your ISPF SWAP key to SWAP NEXT. You should set
           it up that way for any time you are using more than two
           screens inside ISPF

MULTISPF -- To allocate an ISPF Profile for which ever system you are
            on in a multiple TSO environment Add to your default logon
            processing, before entering ISPF
            NOTE:  Contrary to what my article said, you can only logon
            once on any single z/OS image with the same USERID
            Also, the profiles will DRIFT over time, so that the
            contents will differ from each system you sign on to. That
            never bothered me.

PROFSAVE -- Save your ISPF profile without exiting ISPF

SPFLOGOF -- Set up a single key logoff.
            You can use this REXX EXEC, or you can insert the following
            in the TRANS portion of the )BODY of ISR@PRIM (or whatever
            your Primary Panel is):
                 L,'CMD(TSOEXEC LOGOFF)'
