Hi Sirs,

Recently I got an issue in cckddump v0.1.14, trying to dump a
3390-27 with a large usable content. I got an abend x37 on
SYSUT2, which is normal behavior if allocated file is too small.

Problem was I allocated SYSUT2 to the maximum allowed by zOS, 64k
tracks.

Looking through IBM manual I discovered a new JCL allocation
option (since zOS 1.7) called  DSNTYPE=LARGE" that allow us to
allocate a PS file more than 64 tracks.

Actual CCKDDUMP v0.1.14 doesn't support this new kind of Large
datasets, so I modified the source to allow for this support. I
just had to code a DCBE macro for SYSUT2 .

I was then able to dump my 3390-27 on a 135000 trks SYSUT2 dataset.

Updated cckddump ASM source code Is attached to this mail  (I
called it  v0.1.15 , look for CZV70 marks in this source).

As cckdload v0.1.1 had never been updated to restore dump files
blocked to 16k instead of 4k (cckdump was updated to 16k in
2006), I also updated cckdload ASM source code to support 16k
blocksize as well as to support LARGE datasets.

Updated cckdload ASM source code Is also attached to this mail (I
called it  v0.1.2 , look for CZV70 marks in this source).

I send you this email in case you think these updates may be of
interest for the community, as I don't know how to share them.

PS: these programs have been tested successfully up to the limit
of 4 GB which is the limit of CCKD files.

Regards,
Christophe Varlet
