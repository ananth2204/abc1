All the code\nis thread safe.  The data format used by the zlib library\nis described by RFCs (Request for Comments) 1950 to 1952 in the files\nhttp://www.ietf.org/rfc/rfc1950.txt (zlib format), rfc1951.txt (deflate\nformat) and rfc1952.txt (gzip format). These documents are also available in\nother formats from ftp://ftp.uu.net/graphics/png/documents/zlib/zdoc-index.html\n\nAll functions of the compression library are documented in the file zlib.h\n(volunteer to write man pages welcome, contact jloup@gzip.org). A usage\nexample of the library is given in the file example.c which also tests that\nthe library is working correctly. Another example is given in the file\nminigzip.c. The compression library itself is composed of all source files\nexcept example.c and minigzip.c.\n\nTo compile all files and run the test program, follow the instructions\ngiven at the top of Makefile. In short \"make test; make install\"\nshould work for most machines. For Unix: \"./configure; make test; make install\"\nFor MSDOS, use one of the special makefiles such as Makefile.msc.\nFor VMS, use Make_vms.com or descrip.mms.\n\nQuestions about zlib should be sent to <zlib@gzip.org>, or to\nGilles Vollant <info@winimage.com> for the Windows DLL version.\nThe zlib home page is http://www.zlib.org or http://www.gzip.org/zlib/\nBefore reporting a problem, please check this site to verify that\nyou have the latest version of zlib; otherwise get the latest version and\ncheck whether the problem still exists or not.\n\nPLEASE read the zlib FAQ http://www.gzip.org/zlib/zlib_faq.html\nbefore asking for help.\n\nMark Nelson <markn@ieee.org> wrote an article about zlib for the Jan. 1997\nissue of  Dr. Dobb's Journal; a copy of the article is available in\nhttp://dogma.net/markn/articles/zlibtool/zlibtool.htm\n\nThe changes made in version 1.1.4 are documented in the file ChangeLog.\nThe only changes made since 1.1.3 are bug corrections:\n\n- ZFREE was repeated on same allocation on some error conditions.\n  This creates a security problem described in\n  http://www.zlib.org/advisory-2002-03-11.txt\n- Returned incorrect error (Z_MEM_ERROR) on some invalid data\n- Avoid accesses before window for invalid distances with inflate window\n  less than 32K.\n- force windowBits > 8 to avoid a bug in the encoder for a window size\n  of 256 bytes. (A complete fix will be available in 1.1.5).\n\nThe beta version 1.1.5beta includes many more changes. A new official\nversion 1.1.5 will be released as soon as extensive testing has been\ncompleted on it.\n\n\nUnsupported third party contributions are provided in directory \"contrib\".\n\nA Java implementation of zlib is available in the Java Development Kit\nhttp://www.javasoft.com/products/JDK/1.1/docs/api/Package-java.util.zip.html\nSee the zlib home page http://www.zlib.org for details.\n\nA Perl interface to zlib written by Paul Marquess <pmarquess@bfsec.bt.co.uk>\nis in the CPAN (Comprehensive Perl Archive Network) sites\nhttp://www.cpan.org/modules/by-module/Compress/\n\nA Python interface to zlib written by A.M. Kuchling <amk@magnet.com>\nis available in Python 1.5 and later versions, see\nhttp://www.python.org/doc/lib/module-zlib.html\n\nA zlib binding for TCL written by Andreas Kupries <a.kupries@westend.com>\nis availlable at http://www.westend.com/~kupries/doc/trf/man/man.html\n\nAn experimental package to read and write files in .zip format,\nwritten on top of zlib by Gilles Vollant <info@winimage.com>, is\navailable at http://www.winimage.com/zLibDll/unzip.html\nand also in the contrib/minizip directory of zlib.\n\n\nNotes for some targets:\n\n- To build a Windows DLL version, include in a DLL project zlib.def, zlib.rc\n  and all .c files except example.c and minigzip.c; compile with -DZLIB_DLL\n  The zlib DLL support was initially done by Alessandro Iacopetti and is\n  now maintained by Gilles Vollant <info@winimage.com>. Check the zlib DLL\n  home page at http://www.winimage.com/zLibDll\n\n  From Visual Basic, you can call the DLL functions which do not take\n  a structure as argument: compress, uncompress and all gz* functions.\n  See contrib/visual-basic.txt for more information, or get\n  http://www.tcfb.com/dowseware/cmp-z-it.zip\n\n- For 64-bit Irix, deflate.c must be compiled without any optimization.\n  With -O, one libpng test fails. The test works in 32 bit mode (with\n  the -n32 compiler flag). The compiler bug has been reported to SGI.\n\n- zlib doesn't work with gcc 2.6.3 on a DEC 3000/300LX under OSF/1 2.1\n  it works when compiled with cc.\n\n- on Digital Unix 4.0D (formely OSF/1) on AlphaServer, the cc option -std1\n  is necessary to get gzprintf working correctly. This is done by configure.\n\n- zlib doesn't work on HP-UX 9.05 with some versions of /bin/cc. It works\n  with other compilers. Use \"make test\" to check your compiler.\n\n- gzdopen is not supported on RISCOS, BEOS and by some Mac compilers.\n\n- For Turbo C the small model is supported only with reduced performance to\n  avoid any far allocation; it was tested with -DMAX_WBITS=11 -DMAX_MEM_LEVEL=3\n\n- For PalmOs, see http://www.cs.uit.no/~perm/PASTA/pilot/software.html\n  Per Harald Myrvang <perm@stud.cs.uit.no>\n\n\nAcknowledgments:\n\n  The deflate format used by zlib was defined by Phil Katz. The deflate\n  and zlib specifications were written by L. Peter Deutsch.

If not all input can be processed (because there is not\n    enough room in the output buffer), next_in and avail_in are updated and\n    processing will resume at this point for the next call of deflate().\n\n  - Provide more output starting at next_out and update next_out and avail_out\n    accordingly. This action is forced if the parameter flush is non zero.\n    Forcing flush frequently degrades the compression ratio, so this parameter\n    should be set only when necessary (in interactive applications).\n    Some output may be provided even if flush is not set.\n\n  Before the call of deflate(), the application should ensure that at least\n  one of the actions is possible, by providing more input and/or consuming\n  more output, and updating avail_in or avail_out accordingly; avail_out\n  should never be zero before the call.

(In particular\n  avail_in is zero after the call if enough output space has been provided\n  before the call.)  Flushing may degrade compression for some compression\n  algorithms and so it should be used only when necessary.\n\n    If flush is set to Z_FULL_FLUSH, all output is flushed as with\n  Z_SYNC_FLUSH, and the compression state is reset so that decompression can\n  restart from this point if previous compressed data has been damaged or if\n  random access is desired. Using Z_FULL_FLUSH too often can seriously degrade\n  the compression.\n\n    If deflate returns with avail_out == 0, this function must be called again\n  with the same value of the flush parameter and more output space (updated\n  avail_out), until the flush is complete (deflate returns with non-zero\n  avail_out).\n\n    If the parameter flush is set to Z_FINISH, pending input is processed,\n  pending output is flushed and deflate returns with Z_STREAM_END if there\n  was enough output space; if deflate returns with Z_OK, this function must be\n  called again with Z_FINISH and more output space (updated avail_out) but no\n  more input data, until it returns with Z_STREAM_END or an error.
