Hi Sam,

Thx for your work. I have uploaded and run CBT541 updated
material , doing a dump followed by a restore, and that worked as
it have to.

Your Load modules size is different from the ones I generated but
this have to do with z/OS version used during linkedit (C
libraries are used for compress process), so it's not an issue.

You should add in the comments you made that these load modules
can be used asis whichever z/OS version you use, but to assemble
them it's mandatory to have  z/OS 1.7 or later (or maybe z/OS 1.6
with some ptfs to support LARGE DATASETS). I personally have
access to z/OS 1.13 and z/OS 2.1 .

Kind regards
Christophe Varlet
