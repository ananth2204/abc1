*    Description:   Fill the "LAST SLOT" of the already created       *
*                   TSO/E program list tables in storage, with one    *
*                   new program name.                                 *
*                                                                     *
*       Function:   To add one new program name to the global incore  *
*                   TSO auth tables, IKJEFTE2, IKJEFTE8, or           *
*                   IKJEFTAP, IKJEFTNS, or even to the PLATCMD or     *
*                   PLATPGM lists, if they exist.  This is done to    *
*                   the last entry of each table, which had been      *
*                   left empty by the last IPL, SET IKJTSO=xx, or     *
*                   PARMLIB UPDATE(xx) operation.  That is how IBM    *
*                   has designed things.  They leave one extra blank  *
*                   entry at the end, and this is what we are taking  *
*                   advantage of.                                     *
*                                                                     *
*                   This trick (of filling in the last table entry)   *
*                   only works for PARMLIB-created tables, because    *
*                   the tables whose origin is IKJTABLS have no       *
*                   "length attributes" associated with them.  And    *
*                   in those cases, where the tables came from        *
*                   IKJTABLS CSECTs, the only way you know where      *
*                   the end of that table is, is from a blank table   *
*                   entry.  Then, the blank entry is the table's      *
*                   delimiter.                                        *
*                                                                     *
*         Syntax:   LSLT TTA pgmname                                  *

*                   Where TT is a table code, and A is an action      *
*                   code.                                             *

*                   If the action code is B (blank the last           *
*                   entry), then no program name is required.         *
*                                                                     *
*                   If the action code is D (display the last         *
*                   entry), then no program name is required.         *
*                                                                     *
*                   If the action code is A (add a new program        *
*                   name) then one program name is required.          *
*                                                                     *
*                   If the PLATCMD or PLATPGM keywords (and at least  *
*                   one name) were not coded in the active IKJTSOxx   *
*                   PARMLIB entry, then there is no control block of  *
*                   names to be pointed to, and therefore no addition *
*                   of names can be made.  The condition is reported. *
