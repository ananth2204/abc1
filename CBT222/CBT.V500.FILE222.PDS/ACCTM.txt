ACCT     TITLE 'Give this TSO user PSCB TSO privileges'
* ---------------------------------------------------------------- *
*    This program does not obtain authorization by itself. You     *
*    have to either put it into the IKJEFTE2 table, or use a       *
*    "trick SVC" to obtain authorization. But it WILL tell you     *
*    if YOU got authorization for it. Also linkedit SETCODE AC(1). *
