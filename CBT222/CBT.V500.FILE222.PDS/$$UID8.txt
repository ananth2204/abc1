Several of the programs here are part of our 8-character userid
simulation kit, otherwise known as our UID8.TOOLKIT.  These programs
have been used to simulate an 8-character userid environment on a
pre-z/OS 2.3 system.  Even though everything about 8-character ids
are not in effect there, the changing of (future) appropriate fields
allows you to write programs which test their contents.

There is considerable use for these programs on a z/OS 2.3 system
as well.

Any program whose assembly JCL points to a UID8.TOOLKIT dataset comes
from this collection.

These programs are useful for those who are doing this programming,
on a sandbox machine that will not affect any production work.  Use
of these programs on a "production machine" IS HIGHLY NOT RECOMMENDED.

There definitely will be some productive use for these programs in a
development environment, and that is why they are being included here.
