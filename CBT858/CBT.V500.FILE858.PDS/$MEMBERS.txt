                    Clemson University Structured Macros

This library contains all macros required to write and assemble programs
using the Clemson University Structured Macros.

These materials are being made available to cbttape.org under the

Naming Conventions
------------------

  o The member describing what is in this library (this member), is
    named $MEMBERS.
  o The "Structured Macros User's Guide and Reference" manual is
    included in the CBT package as a single html file, strucmac.html.

  All members beginning with "##" are internal macros.  Some may be
  useful in certain situations, such as coding DEFUCOND macros.  See
  the documentation for more information.

  All members beginning with '$' are documentation (such as it is),
  license information or JCL examples.

  All members whose names don't begin with a special character are
  macro members.

  Exception:

  Member MSC0150$ is the source for the Structured Macro listing
  program.  This program should be included as a precompile step in
  all assembly jobs using the Macros, since it will:

    a) produce a cleaner listing with nesting levels;  this listing
       is often easier to read, since expansion of the macros can be
       verbose at times
    b) ensures that structures "line up" (BLOCK and ENDBLK, IF and
       ENDIF, etc) and ends with a nonzero RC if it finds a problem.
       Structure problems can be much harder to find using just the
       assembler listing.

  As part of the installation of the Structured Macros, you should
  assemble MSC0150$ (feel free to name it whatever makes sense in
  your shop) and link it into a public place like USER.LINKLIB.
  Then, include it as a precompile step in Structured Macro assembly
  jobs (see member $ASMONE for a model).
