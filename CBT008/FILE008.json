File 008 is supposed to reflect the\njobs needed to create the new CBT tape version, so before you\ncut a new tape version, the last thing you have to do, is update\nFile 008 for the new version, and prepare it for the Updates page.\n\n\nThe new tape version will be cut from jobs on SBGOLOB.CBT496.FILE008\nwhich are of the form:  NEWTnnna\n\n   The first 10 of these jobs actually cut the new tape in SL format.\n\n   The jobs afterwards create the NL version, measure it, and then\n     you have to correct the measurements for the new tape, on\n     SBGOLOB.CBTDOC.PDS, and then you create a new FILE001 on\n     SBGOLOB.CBT.EDIT by running COMBINE : 'SBGOLOB.CBT.CNTL' NOSEP\n     under STARTOOL, and then running the CLIST called DOCFILA\n     to fix columns 73-80 and copy that FILE001 to\n     SBGOLOB.CBT.EDIT(FILE001).\n\n   You replace FILE001 on all versions of the new tape with the\n     new edit version that has the correct measurements and dates.\n     This is the final cut tape of the new version.\n\n   Jobs to do this, are in SBGOLOB.CBT.EDIT in the form NEWTnnna.\n\n\nJobs needed to be run after a new CBT Tape has been created.\n\n   Volumes CBTA01 thru CBTA04 have the following functions:\n\n       CBTA01 - Contains completely unloaded CBT Tape files\n                 from the current tape version\n                 Jobs VnnnJ01 thru VnnnJ10 will load this\n                 pack, after job DELNTnnn has deleted and\n                 uncataloged all the old files there.\n                 For good measure, ZZSA is the IPL text on\n                 this volume.\n\n       CBTA02 - Contains all the CBT files for this version\n                 which are being prepared to update the\n                 web site directory \"CBT\".  These are in the\n                 form CBT.Vnnn.FILExxx.DATA   or the\n                 form CBT.Vnnn.FILExxx.XMI\n                Jobs to produce the XMIT-format files are in\n                 members VnnnX01 thru VnnnX09.\n\n       CBTA03 - Contains a DFDSS restore of a backup of volume\n                 DATA03 at a level concurrent with when the new\n                 tape version was cut and the tape was made.\n                 Jobs to load this volume are DFDSSBK3 and DFDSSR4.\n\n       CBTA04 - Contains all the XMIT-format files for all the\n                 files on the CBT tape, created as the files are\n                 updated in real time, in between cuts of the\n                 tape versions.\n\nRun the following sets of jobs in the stated order, after the\ntape version has been cut and finalized.\n\n1.   DFDSSBK3 and DFDSSR4 to back up and restore the DATA03 pack\n     to the CBTA03 pack.  This is the final image of DATA03 after\n     creating the new tape version, and before any renames have\n     been done to any files.\n\n2.   TSORnnn - Job to rename all new files consistently so that\n     they have similar names to the old files.  This will provide\n     a fixed base upon which to build the next tape version.\n\n     Files of form:  SBGOLOB.CBTnnn.FILExxx   will be renamed to\n     files of form:  CBT.CBTnnn.FILExxx.PDS   or\n                     CBT.CBTnnn.FILExxx.DATA\n\n     Files of form:  CBT.CBTmmm.FILExxx.PDS   will be renamed to\n     files of form:  CBT.CBTnnn.FILExxx.PDS   or\n                     CBT.CBTnnn.FILExxx.DATA\n\n        where nnn = mmm + 1      (new version number)\n              mmm                (old version number)\n\n3.   Edit and run job DELNTnnn which will delete and uncatalog all\n     of the files on volume CBTA01.  This volume is the volume that\n     will be posted on the CBT web site www.cbttape.org as a DFDSS\n     backup and an FDR backup.  This volume also contains IPL text\n     for ZZSA.  (Job IPLTZZSA)\n\n\n4.   Edit and run jobs VnnnJ01 thru VnnnJ10, which will load volume\n     CBTA01 with all the datasets from the current CBT Tape volume\n     that you just made.\n\n5.   Run jobs DFDSSBKV and FDRBACKV to produce DFDSS and FDR backups\n     of volume CBTA01.\n\n6.   Run jobs TRSCBTD1 and TRSCBTF1 to produce tersed files of these\n     backups.  These tersed files will be posted to the web site.\n\n7.   Some of the jobs of the form:  NEWTnnna  will TAPEMAP the newly\n     created CBT Tape version.  Go to SDSF and copy the TAPEMAP of\n     the latest version to SBGOLOB.OUTPUTS(CBTnnnM).  Use the NL\n     version of the tape, because this TAPEMAP will be posted to\n     the web site.\n\n8.   Replace all the places in the web site which have version mmm\n     in it, with equivalents of version nnn, where nnn = mmm + 1.\n     Delete versions that are two back.  Only keep one previous\n     version.\n\n\nWeb Site Updates\n\n\n1.   .zip files will have to be prepared from the .XMI and .DATA\n     files that are on volume CBTA01.\n\n     FTP all of these files in BINARY from volume CBTA01 to a\n     directory cbt-nnn that is on the PC.\n\n     Use Win-RAR to zip all of these files in bulk, to a new\n     directory on the PC:  cbt-nnnz\n\n     Back up the entire CBT directory on the web site.\n     Back up the entire Updates directory on the web site.\n\n     Update the CBT directory with the new files from directory\n     cbt-nnnz.\n\n     Replace all files on the CBT directory with the new files\n     from the new version.\n\n     Replace all the places in the web site which have version mmm\n     in it, with equivalents of version nnn, where nnn = mmm + 1.\n     Delete versions that are two back.

REPLACEMENT OR NON-REPLACEMENT OF ./ TO >< AND VICE-VERSA\n  ---------- ----------- -- --------------- -- -- -- -- --- ----------\n\nThe PDSLOAD program (which performs a lot of the functionality of\nIEBUPDTE) loads a partitioned dataset from a sequentialized version\nof it, using \"./ ADD NAME=memname\" cards to separate what should be\neach member.\n\nSometimes, such a sequentialized pds (now a PS sequential file) is\nitself a member of a pds.  And we package CBT Tape files that way\nquite often.  The CBT Tape file is itself a pds, but some of IT'S\nmembers are sequentialized pds'es, containing a lot of \"./ ADD NAME=\"\ncards beginning in column 1.  How do we prevent IEBUPDTE, or PDSLOAD,\nfrom unwanted expansion of these \"inner\" pds'es, while we are busy\nreloading the \"outer\" pds?\n\nWhat we do, while we are sequentializing the outer pds, is that\nautomatically, using either the LISTPDS program or the OFFLOAD\nprogram, we change all \"./ ADD NAME=memname\" to \">< ADD NAME=memname\"\nin the inner pds.  Then, when we go the opposite way, to make a pds\nout of the \"outer\" sequential file, the inner pds remains as a single\nsequential file, and there is no confusion between any >< cards in the\ninner pds, and the ./ cards in the outer pds.  There are simply no ./\ncards in the inner pds.  They are all changed to ><.  Upon expansion\nof the outer pds, the inner pds remains a single member in the\nexpanded outer pds that was created (by IEBUPDTE or PDSLOAD) from the\n\"outer\" sequentialized pds file.\n\nIn order to further expand the \"inner pds\" which is now a member of\nthe \"outer\" pds (which is a pds), we have to change all the \"><\"\nstrings in IT, to \"./\" strings in column 1.  The PDSLOAD program does\nthis automatically, when we tell it to, using a PARM of UPDTE(><).\n\nNowadays, with new expanded techniques in packaging CBT Tape files,\nthis leads to a problem.  A member of a pds on a CBT Tape file, may\nnot only be a \"sequentialized pds\", sequentialized using IEBUPDTE or\nLISTPDS, or OFFLOAD, and containing the >< string in column 1\npurposely.  It may also be other stuff that possibly might contain the\nstring >< in column 1 of the (FB-80) pds member.  And how can that\nhappen?\n\nWe sometimes fold zip files as FB-80, and include them as members of\nan FB-80 pds, in a CBT Tape file.  Sometimes the member might be a\nfolded over Word docx file, or a PDF file, or it might even be a file\nof a load module in Greg Price's REVLOAD format.  If it would happen\nthat the string >< lands in column 1, PDSLOAD would automatically\nchange it to a ./ string, and that would wreak a lot of havoc in a\nzip file, and considerable havoc in a Word or PDF file.\n\n\nHOW DO WE STOP THAT?\n\nAn excellent programmer, a person with much experience in this area,\nhas created a way to flag these \"exceptional cases\" using the\noptional DDNAME of SYSUPLOG, to be used by both the LISTPDS and\nPDSLOAD programs.  The LISTPDS program which sequentialized the pds\norignally, flags which records have the string >< in column 1.  And\nthe PDSLOAD program, which re-creates the pds from its sequentialized\nform, reads that \"exception file\" and purposely DOES NOT change the\n>< (which should be there) back to ./ (which shouldn't be there).\n\nThis preserves the integrity of the CBT Tape files when they are\nreloaded to disk.  If you use the UPDATEO proc to restore a CBT Tape\nfile, you absolutely need access to the already-created SYSUPLOG\nfile which was made when the CBT Tape file was created.  An IEBUPDTE\nunloaded version of this file is found in member SYSUPLOG in CBT File\n008, and the job to re-create the file is called SYSUPLO$.  Please\nmake sure this file is present when you do PDSLOAD reloads from CBT\nTape files.\n\nThe NEWTnnnx members of File 008 and the VnnnJmxx members of this\npds have been changed to add this DDNAME for all LISTPDS invocations.\nThis seems to have solved the problem of file integrity in the\ndisk expansions of all the CBT Tape files.\n\nOne problem is that to properly load some of the CBT Tape disk files\nfrom tape, you need to have the SYSUPLOG file made by LISTPDS to create\nthe tape.  So for each level of the CBT Tape, we provide that SYSUPLOG\nfile here.  Just look at this pds (CBT File 008) and run the SYSUPLO$\njob against the SYSUPLOG member of CBT File 008, and you will generate\nthe proper SYSUPLOG file.  Then you can run the VnnnJmm jobs properly.\n\n\nSam Golob    -   2015/10/21  -  email:  sbgolob@cbttape.org\n\n\n", "mimetype": "text/plain", "datatype": "ebcdic", "extension": ".txt"}, "##CBT973": {"ttr": 1798, "alias": false, "halfwords": 30, "notes": 0, "parms": "b'\\x01\\x00\\x00\\x00\\x00\\x903\\x1f\\x00\\x903\\x1f\\x19\\x17\\x01\\x07\\x01\\x07\\x00\\x00\\xe3\\xe2\\xe3\\xf2\\xe2\\xe2\\xc7@@@'", "ispf": {"version": "01.00", "flags": 0, "createdate": "1990-11-27T00:00:00", "modifydate": "1990-11-27T19:17:00", "lines": 263, "newlines": 263, "modlines": 0, "user": "TST2SSG"}, "text": "*          DATA SET CBT973     AT LEVEL 003 AS OF 03/21/79\n* * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * *       00001\n* * * *                C B T 9 7 3                        * * * *       00002\n* * * *                                                   * * * *       00003\n* * * *       WRITTEN   BY  H.

Each job writes a maximum of 100 files on the tape,\n because of the limit on TIOT size, limiting the number of DD entries\n that can be coded in one job.  Sometimes the last job will contain\n a few more than 100 jobs, but when it gets too big, a new job will\n be created according to the last \"100 file boundary\".\n\n Load modules needed for File 008 can be found in the LOADLIB member\n here, or on CBT Tape File 035.\n\n It is assumed that volumes, V500MT (SL)\n                             C500MU (SL)\n                             CBT500 (NL)  are properly initted tapes.\n\n The tape created is assumed (at present) to be a very long 3490,\n  and it is in the P390 AWS format.  To convert to an actual tape,\n  use the VTT2TAPE program from CBT File 533.  The AWS-format tape\n  can be downloaded from www.cbttape.org.\n\n The real length of the tape would only actually fit on a 3590.\n\n If anyone still needs a real tape, please let me know.  We also\n have a 3390-3 disk which has all the CBT files.  There is a\n DFDSS backup of it (tersed) and an FDR backup of it (tersed) on\n the www.cbttape.org web site.\n\n Due to the fact that I sometimes put folded zip files, PDF files,\n and Microsoft Word files on the CBT file pds'es, folded over FB-80,\n it is very possible that the string \"><\" will naturally occur in\n columns 1 and 2 of a file member.  In order to prevent those records\n from being changed to the string \"./\" by the PDSLOAD program during\n the reloading of this tape, and thereby corrupting the reload\n output, it is necessary to include the //SYSUPLOG DD NAME in the JCL\n to run the LISTPDS, OFFLOAD, and PDSLOAD programs.  The LISTPDS,\n OFFLOAD, and PDSLOAD programs have been modified to include an extra\n DDNAME of //SYSUPLOG, which is a pds that contains all records that\n REALLY SHOULD contain the string \"><\" in columns 1 and 2, if they\n ever occur (and they do).  The //SYSUPLOG file is contained as an\n IEBUPDTE sequentialized pds, on File 007 of the CBT Tape.  It is\n especially constructed at the time each version of the CBT Tape is\n made, and is tailored to each version cut of the CBT Tape.\n\n Please use the version of the SYSUPLOG file, which corresponds to\n the version of the tape you are unloading.\n\n", "mimetype": "text/plain", "datatype": "ebcdic", "extension": ".txt"}, "BUFDEF": {"ttr": 2051, "alias": false, "halfwords": 30, "notes": 0, "parms": "b'\\x01\\x03\\x00\"\\x01\\x13\\x00\\x1f\\x01\\x191_\\t2\\x00\\x07\\x00\\x02\\x00\\x00\\xe2\\xc2\\xc7\\xd6\\xd3\\xd6\\xc2@@@'", "ispf": {"version": "01.03", "flags": 0, "createdate": "2013-01-01T00:00:00", "modifydate": "2019-11-11T09:32:22", "lines": 7, "newlines": 2, "modlines": 0, "user": "SBGOLOB"}, "text": "These are the operator commands you need to run the CBT Tape jobs,\nNEWTnnnx from SBGOLOB.CBT.EDIT in order to create the tape\nand not run out of JES2 buffers.\n\n$TBUFDEF,BELOWBUF=(LIMIT=100)\n$TBUFDEF,EXTBUF=(LIMIT=100)\nK S,DEL=RD,SEG=14,CON=N,RNUM=19,RTME=1/4,MFORM=(T,J)\n", "mimetype": "text/plain", "datatype": "unknown-8bit", "extension": ".txt"}, "CBTSTATS": {"ttr": 2053, "alias": false, "halfwords": 30, "notes": 0, "parms": "b'\\x04X\\x00\\x00\\x00\\x90&\\x1f\\x00\\x90&\\x1f\\x12\\x00\\x01S\\x01S\\x00\\x00\\xc3\\xc2\\xe3\\xf3\\xf2\\xf0@@@@'", "ispf": {"version": "04.88", "flags": 0, "createdate": "1990-09-18T00:00:00", "modifydate": "1990-09-18T12:00:00", "lines": 339, "newlines": 339, "modlines": 0, "user": "CBT320"}, "text": "                                                                    *\n  * THIS  C            NAME          FILE(S)      LAST DATE UPDATED *\n  *       B                                                         *\n  *       T                                                         *\n  *       7                                                         *\n  *       3                                                         *\n  *       6                                                         *\n  *                                                                 *\n  *  X    273-   01 .
