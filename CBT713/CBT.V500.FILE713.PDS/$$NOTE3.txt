Note from Sam Golob  -  Mar 01, 2009


Hartmut Beckmann complained that EMPTYPDS still issues return code
0 even though there is an error.  I re-worked the end game of the
program and put in the proper return code of 8 if there is an
error.

If SYSPRINT is missing, the proper WTO's duplicating the error
messages that should have been issued, are written to the JES log.
Return code of the program always reflects what the program did.
So even if you don't have SYSPRINT, you know what the program did.

Re-titled the program with Version 2.0.  Print title in any case.

Fixed some error messages to be more accurate.  For example, a PDSE
has to be allocated OLD or MOD, but a PDS can be allocated SHR.

Eliminated the need for File 172 program macros, such as PGMIN, etc.
No external macros are now necessary for assembly, only macros from
SYS1.MACLIB and SYS1.MODGEN.  I am including the macros here, so you
can still assemble old versions of the program.
