Sam,

See the attached notes from Steve Myers about changes he made to
my EMPTYPDS program.

This looks like a neat change, but I haven't tested it.
Personally I am not bothered about the APF requirement, so I
would put it into my source PDS as an alternative, not a
replacement. I have not written any new code for a long time, so
there are no updates to file 172 apart from this.  I suggest you
put this program up as a separate (sequential) file and credit
Steve with the work.

Dave

Note from Sam Golob:   I tested it...  Seems fine.

     Tested on multitrack source and load libraries whose
     directories exactly fill a track.  On z/OS 1.6.

Good morning Dave -

The attached file contains an updated version of EMPTYPDS.  The
main update was to remove the requirement for APF authorization.
This was done by using EXCP, and arranging things so that CLOSE
updates the VTOC for the data set.

For political reasons, I cannot do anything else with the
program.  If you want to send it up to CBT, go ahead.

It could use a little more testing, too.  Try a directory that
extends to multiple tracks, as well as a directory that exactly
fills a track.  (I tested it with a 6-track directory that has
many members, and exactly fills the tracks -- works fine.

If you are reluctant to do anything with it, I can
understand that, too.

Sincerely - Steve Myers
