Hi Sam -

A user reported a problem with EMPTYPDS: it was inserting
LRECL=256 into the DSCB.  The attached file contains an updated
version of the program that corrects this problem.

After fiddling with a very simple example, I discovered the
problem was caused when the LRECL was written to the JFCB when
reading the directory, and then written to the data set label
when the EXCP DCB was opened.  It was corrected by not allowing
DCB attributes to be merged into the JFCB when the directory DCB
was opened.

The customer's system is z/OS 1.5.  I was able to recreate the
problem using z/OS 1.4.

Sincerely - Steve Myers
