//*      CKS@     - this member
//*
//*      CKSPGM   - assembler source for the CKSPGM batch program
//*                 which is independent from the CKSUM TSO command.
//*
//*      CKSPGM$  - JCL to assemble CKSPGM and the CKSUMR subprogram.
//*
//*      CKSUM    - assembler source for the 31-bit CKSUM TSO command.
//*                 It calls the CKSUMR subprogram.
//*
//*      CKSUM$   - JCL to assemble CKSUM and the CKSUMR subprogram.
//*
//*      CKSUM#   - TSO HELP text for the CKSUM TSO command.
//*
//*      CKSUMR   - assembler source for CKSUMR subprogram
//*                 This must be linked with the CKSUM TSO command,
//*                 and the CKSPGM program.
//*
//*      CKSUMR24 - assembler source for same CKSUMR subprogram,
//*                 with AMODE and RMODE removed for IFOX00 assembler.
//*                 Intended for MVS 3.8 systems.

//*                 Intended for MVS 3.8 systems.
//*
//*      CKSUM24$ - JCL to assemble CKSUM24 and CKSUMR24 using the
//*                 MVS 3.8 IFOX00 assembler, and link as the
//*                 24-bit CKSUM TSO command.
