from http://homerow.net/asm/md5
which has a link to:
http://homerow.net/cgi-bin/dl?md5-04.078.tar.gz
The file named md5-04.078/md5 inside the tar file has the assembler
source for the MD5 function callable by REXX, a REXX program
to test it with, and JCL to assemble and test.
The results of the test job look like this:

   Digesting: Fried Rattlesnake
              Turkey Neck Gumbo
              Pecan Pie
   Produces:  A39F852688191291396F93DECB94DA57

A test was run on a Windows PC to see if the same results
could be obtained.

A command-line md5.exe for windows was downloaded from
http://www.fourmilab.ch/md5/

A zip file named UnxUtils.zip containing dd.exe, md5sum.exe, and
tr.exe, ports of GNU utilities, was downloaded from
http://sourceforge.net/projects/unxutils/

This md5sum.exe and the md5.exe mentioned previously work the same.

The command "dd conv=ebcdic" translates the input from ASCII to
EBCDIC, and changes the hex 0d0a at end-of-line to hex 0d25.

The command tr -d "\r\045" tells tr.exe to copy input to
output deleting any end-of-line characters like hex 0d and hex 25.
We want to exclude the end-of-line characters from the md5 input.

The command used to test on windows was: (with tr operands omitted)
echo Fried RattlesnakeTurkey Neck GumboPecan Pie|dd conv=ebcdic|tr|md5
0+1 records in
0+1 records out
A39F852688191291396F93DECB94DA57  -

If md5sum.exe is used instead of md5.exe, the result is:
a39f852688191291396f93decb94da57 *-
which is the same, but in lower case.

Both results match the results of the REXX program.

The tr operands were omitted in the command line above so it would fit
in the first 72 columns of this document. The command line as it should
look, but with a shorter input string:
echo Fried Rattlesnake|dd conv=ebcdic|tr -d "\r\045"|md5sum

The echo command will output a trailing blank if there is a space
between the last character and the pipe symbol, and the md5 result
will be different.
