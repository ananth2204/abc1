Hi Sam,

There are updates for file 900, including the addition of the
CKSUM TSO command. It serves a similar purpose as the MD5SUM
command but with a different checksum algorithm. Like MD5SUM, if
the results of CKSUM are the same on different systems, the file
contents are highly likely to be identical.  There is also a
CKSPGM program that does the same thing as CKSUM in a batch job
or a TSO CALL command.

There already is a "cksum" command in z/OS Unix System Services,
but it does not directly read data sets, just Unix files.

Wikipedia has an article about the Unix cksum command.

Here is a list of members that are added or updated.

The first 2 are identical, and describe what the other CK*
members are. The MD5* and SHA* updates are very minor, for
correctly setting an RDW in VB files, which never caused a
problem but it might have just been luck that a getmained area
had zeroes in it.
