)F FUNCTION -
  THE MD5SUM COMMAND DISPLAYS THE MD5 CHECKSUM OF DATA SETS SPECIFIED.
  IN DATA SETS WITH VARIABLE-LENGTH RECORDS THE RDW'S AND SDW'S ARE
  NOT INCLUDED WHEN THE CHECKSUM IS COMPUTED UNLESS THE RDW KEYWORD
  IS SPECIFIED.
)X SYNTAX -
         MD5SUM   'DSLIST'  FILE  LOWER  RDW  QUICK

  REQUIRED - 'DSLIST'
  DEFAULTS - NONE

)O OPERANDS -
  'DSLIST' - NAMES OF SEQUENTIAL DATA SETS OR MEMBERS OF PARTITIONED
             DATA SETS.
))FILE     - THE NAMES IN DSLIST ARE DDNAMES, NOT DSNAMES.
))LOWER    - DISPLAY THE RESULTS IN LOWER CASE.
))RDW      - INCLUDE RDW OR SDW IN VARIABLE LENGTH RECORDS.
))QUICK    - FOR UNQUOTED DSNAMES, BYPASS THE DEFAULT SERVICE ROUTINE.
             SO FOR EXAMPLE, IF YOU SPECIFY THE NAME TEMP AND YOU
             ONLY HAVE A DATA SET NAMED TEMP.DATA, IT WON'T BE FOUND
             IF QUICK IS ALSO SPECIFIED. THE QUICK KEYWORD IS JUST
             TO CUT OUT THE OVERHEAD OF LOOKING FOR EXTENSIONS AT
             THE END OF THE SPECIFIED DATA SET NAME.
