Dear Sam,

The attachment contains an xmi file with my contribution PDS.

THE DATASET CONTRIBUTED CONTAINS 3 APPLICATIONS WHICH COULD BE USEFUL
FOR A DB2/SYSTEM ADMIN.  THE CONCEPT IS THE SAME FOR ALL OF THEM.
A BATCH JOB CALLS SOME REXX EXECS IN ORDER TO FULFILL A TASK DESIRED.
THE JOBS AND EXECS ARE COMMENTED INSIDE THE CODE. THERE
IS ALSO README MEMBER INCLUDED.

There are:
1. - DROP/CREATE FOREIGN KEYS DDL STATEMENTS CREATION
2. - USING BATCH JOB FOR A SYSTEM COMMANDS EXECUTION
3. - USING BATCH JOB FOR DB2 DRDA THREADS TERMINATION

I forgot to put my e-mail in readme member, it's:
marino.drazeta@fina.hr .

I also tried to recive the file, successfully.  DA('xxxxx')
dataset asked by receive command should be PDS.

Thank You
