Hello Sam,

Attached is my latest contribution. Let me know if the format has
any problems.

SRCHE

This is a search facility that supports the searching of a user
entered variable across multiple datasets. It consists of (1)
REXX and (3) ISPF panels. It is an enhancement to the already CBT
present SRCH facility which I introduced many years ago. The core
code was created by LEE Hayden. I created the logic that wraps
around it.

Users interface with SRCHE (SRCH EXTENDED) in two ways, both in
TSO/E. ONE: simply issue  TSO SRCHE  and a panel pops up to allow
one to enter any dataset name search mask. TWO: on a  3.4  screen
showing one or more dataset names, enter  SRCHE  on a dsname line
and the same panel pops up with that name in its dsname mask. At
this point  users can modify the panel dsname to whatever they
want.

A main issue with doing all this is that one may inadvertently
request one (or many) DFHSM MIGRATED datasets to appear as
potential search targets. SRCHE presents a list of all MIGRATED
datasets so the user can rethink his/her search mask. SRCHE will
NOT issue any RECALLS. This must be done by the user. Once a
valid list of target datasets has been created, SRCHE will then
act like SRCH and ask the user for a valid search argument to go
against the list of datasets previously created. A maximum of
5,000 hits is supported but that can easily be changed in the
REXX. The only limitation is the size of a TSO user s region.

Any suggestions to make this a better product are welcome. I
don t have the time I used to have in working this fun stuff so
it may take me a while to complete a change.
