THE MEMBERS OF THIS DATASET ARE ALL WRITTEN IN BAL. ORIGINALLY INTENDED
FOR USE AS UTILITIES FOR COBOL PROGRAMS. THEY ALL USE THE ATTACHED
MACLIB. SINCE MOST OF THE PROGRAMS HERE
ARE SUBROUTINES, THEY ARE USED BY MAIN PROGRAMS SUCH AS "LIST".

ALMOST ALL OF THE PROGRAMS HERE HAVE SOME DOCUMENTATION BEFORE THE
START OF THE CODE THAT DESCRIBES THE PARAMETER LIST BUT
ALL OF THEM ARE DESCRIBED BY THE 'EPA' (ENTRY POINT ADDRESS) MACRO.

FOR THE ROUTINES (LIKE SCAN AND PARSE) THAT DON'T HAVE A DOCUMENTATION
HEADER, YOU COULD EASILY FIGURE OUT HOW TO USE IT BECAUSE THE LINKAGE
SECTION IS DESCRIPTIVE ENOUGH I WOULD THINK.

THE CALENDAR PROGRAM HAS A BUG FOR THE MONTH OF FEBRUARY. I THINK IT
DISPLAYS 28 DAYS EVEN IF IT'S A LEAP YEAR. BUT THE MONTH OF MARCH IS
OK. I GUESS I'M JUST TOO LAZY TO FIX IT.
IF YOU INVOKE CALENDAR W/O PARMS, IT WILL DISPLAY THE CURRENT DATE.
IF YOU WANT A SPECIFIC DATE, INVOKE IT LIKE "CALENDAR YYYYMMDD"

MOST OF THE SUBROUTINES HERE ARE Y2K COMPLIANT I BELIEVE. BUT SOME,
LIKE GUS002 (CONVERT YYMMDD TO YYDDD) MAY NOT NEED TO BE... I HAVEN'T
CHECKED.

THE PROGRAM FLPRT JUST PRINTS THE DATASET DEFINED IN SYSUT1. ONLY
FLPRT AND CALENDAR ARE NON-REENTRANT; ALL THE REST ARE RE-ENTRANT
PROGRAMS.

"LIST" JUST DISPLAYS THE CONTENTS OF THE DATA PASSED ON THE COMMAND
LINE. IT IS INCLUDED HERE AS AN EXAMPLE OF A PROGRAM THAT USES THE
PARSE, PUTLINE AND DYNALLOC SUBROUTINES (GUS014,GUS016 AND GUS012).
TST9 IS ANOTHER TEST PROGRAM THAT DEMONSTRATES HOW THE SCAN, GETLINE
AND PUTLINE ROUTINES HELP MAKE WRITING COMMAND PROCESSORS EASY.

BTW, GUS STANDS FOR GENERAL UTILITY SUBROUTINES.

THE MACLIB MEMBER SF IS TO CREATE 3270 ATTRIBUTES; BUT I HAVEN'T
GOTTEN AROUND TO SUPPORT THE X'29' ORDER FOR EXTENDED ATTRIBUTES.
IT DOES SUPPORT FUJITSU'S X'1B' ORDER FOR F9526 EXTENDED ATTRIBUTES.

I HOPE YOU FIND THESE USEFUL.
