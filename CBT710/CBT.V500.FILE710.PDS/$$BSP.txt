Hi Wayne,

    I am looking at your DDU package.  Where can I get
your BSPAUTH macro?  Or do I have to roll my own.
Can you send yours to me, and the auth mechanism?
Thanks in advance.

Hi Sam,

   BSP anything is Volker's stuff.

   The JCL shows SYS2.MACLIB

   A yahoo search turns up:
 http://www.bsp-gmbh.com/turnkey/cookbook/svc244.html

   The SVC was already in my copy of MVS Tur(n)key #4
so I didn't need to assemble it.

   OS/390 and zOS do not need BSPAUTH.  A PARMLIB
update and PARMLIB command will work.
