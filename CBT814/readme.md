//***FILE 814 was sent in by Eugene Vogt and contains a huge        *   FILE 814
//*           collection of old XEPHON "MVS Update" articles in     *   FILE 814
//*           text format.  They are not the magazines themselves,  *   FILE 814
//*           but they contain ASCII machine-readable code from     *   FILE 814
//*           the articles, and most, or all, of the explanatory    *   FILE 814
//*           material that is in the articles.                     *   FILE 814
//*                                                                 *   FILE 814
//*           XEPHON has now given permission for www.cbttape.org   *   FILE 814
//*           to maintain and distribute their articles and their   *   FILE 814
//*           magazines.  (This is as of May 2008.)                 *   FILE 814

//*           These articles appear to cover the XEPHON MVS Update  *   FILE 814
//*           materials from the years 1987 thru 1996, so the       *   FILE 814
//*           only gaps still remaining, are the year 1997 alone,   *   FILE 814
//*           and before 1987.  Also, after 2006, the "Update"      *   FILE 814
//*           magazines have not been released to us by Thomas      *   FILE 814
//*           Publications.                                         *   FILE 814

//*           These articles are for "MVS Update" only.  Other      *   FILE 814
//*           Xephon "Update" magazines are not covered in this     *   FILE 814
