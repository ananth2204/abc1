Generating a dump for certain WTO messages
I have sometimes needed to get a system dump to find out why a job has issued a
certain message but I haven’t wanted to go to the trouble of patching code.
With MVS one can easily do this with an MPF Exit.  Simply code the routine below
and put it into LINKLIST library (don’t forget to refresh LLA).  Add the
following MPFLST card to a copy of your current MPFLSTxx member in SYS1.
PARMLIB:
     xxxxxxx,USEREXIT(mmmmmmmm)
where xxxxxxxx is the message text up to the first blank, and mmmmmmmm is the
name of your module (eg MPFEXIT).
After issuing the SET MPF=xx command, run your job and the system will take a
dump when the WTO is issued.
Referring to the MVS User Exits manual one can tailor the exit to trigger only
under certain circumstances (eg for a specific job).
