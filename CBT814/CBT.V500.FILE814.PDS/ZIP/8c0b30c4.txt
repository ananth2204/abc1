Creating an MVS mini system

This article describes a minimum MVS system, located on one
disk, which will run JES, VTAM, TSO, and ISPF.  By
copying only the necessary files from your current system you
need less than 200 cylinders of 3380 to constitute a mini MVS
system.  Such a system can be saved on one tape or cartridge.

It is mainly for safety.  With a mini MVS system on disk you
can re-IPL immediately in the case of a big crash on your
present SYSRES (or on other important volumes) in order to be
able to restore what has been damaged.  Also, you avoid using
DF/DSS stand-alone, which is two or three times slower than
DF/DSS executing under MVS.  If you have PR/SM (or its
equivalent) installed, you can use a mini MVS system to test a
new partition quickly.

Keeping a mini MVS system on tape preceded by the DF/DSS
stand-alone program (rather than on DASD) enables you to
restore it to disk immediately after IPLing from the 3420/3480
unit and entering the DF/DSS stand-alone parameters.  This
can help you substantially when you bring your system up on a
back-up site.  After restoring the mini MVS system, you log on
and submit jobs to restore the remaining volumes.  Eventually
you can IPL on the restored system.

Of course, you will not create a clone of your production
system, but only a small MVS to be used temporarily.  All the
files are the smallest possible (there are no SMF, STGINDEX,
DUMPxx, or NCPLIB files).  The only RACF/TSO user-id
will be IBMUSER.  At IPL time you must expect many
messages and replies because of the lack of some system files
or PARMLIB members.
The following steps create a mini MVS system with JES2,
RACF, VTAM, TSO, and ISPF on a disk called MINMVS.
The driving system is MVS/XA.

1     Initialize MINMVS with IPL text using ICKDSF.

2     Allocate MINI.PARMLIB, MINI.LOGREC,
     MINI.PROCLIB, MINI.UADS, MINI.BRODCAST,
     MINI.HASPCKPT, and MINI.HASPACE on it using
     IEFBR14.  The size of this latter file will be 20 3380
     cylinders.  Allocate only a few tracks for the others.

3     Change the high-level identifier from MINI to SYS1 using
     IEHPROGM.

4     Using IDCAMS, define a USERCAT on MINMVS: it will
     be the future master catalog.  You may optionally define
     all the aliases of your driving system in it.

5     Copy on MINMVS the main libraries of your current
     system.  With DF/DSS, the SYSIN would be:

     COPY DS(INCLUDE(SYS1.LINKLIB,
     SYS1.LPALIB,SYS1.SVCLIB,SYS1.CMDLIB, -
     SYS1.NUCLEUS,SYS1.VTAMLST,SYS1.VTAMLIB,  -
     ISR.**,ISP.**)) -
     ODY(MINMVS) TOL (ENQF) WAIT(0,0) SHR

6     Update SYS1.NUCLEUS(SYSCATLG) on MINMVS
     using IEBGENER or IEBDG to indicate the new master
     catalog.

7     Define three page datasets: PLPA (10 cylinders),
     COMMON (5 cylinders), and LOCAL (30 cylinders).

8     Catalogue in the new master catalog all the files created in
     steps 2 and 5 using DEFINE NONVSAM.  Also create an
     entry for SYS1.RACF.

9     Update the following members in your new
     SYS1.PARMLIB with IEBUPDTE,PARM=NEW:

     -     IEAAPF00 - SYS1.VTAMLIB MINMVS
     -     LNKLST00 - SYS1. LINKLIB and SYS1.CMDLIB
     -     IEASYS00 - APF=00,LNK=00,PAGE=, etc
     -     TSOKEY00 - no change

     With MVS/XA 2.2.0 and above, you need a CONSOL00 ]
     member.

10     Update the following procedures in your new
     SYS1.PROCLIB:

     -     JES2 (with no user PROCLIB)
     -     NET (with only SYS1.VTAMLIB, SYS1.VTAMLST)
     -     IKJS - TSO LOGON procedure, with all ISPF files,
          and a temporary //ISPROF.  Code EXEC
          PGM=IKJEFT01, PARM=ISPF to invoke ISPF
          directly.

     At IPL time, you will have to start JES2, NET, and TSO
     manually (you may create a COMMND00 member in
     PARMLIB in advance).

11     Transfer the following procedures from your current
     SYS1.PROCLIB: TSO, LLA, DUMPSRV, IEESYSAS,
     IEEVMPCR, and INIT

12     Transfer your current JES2PARM and modify it as
     follows:

     SPOOLDEF ...,VOL=MINMVS,DSNAME=SYS1.HASPACE
     CKPTDEF ....,VOL=MINMVS,DSNAME=SYS1.HASPCKPT

13     Create and initialize SYS1.RACF as follows:

     //        EXEC PGM=ICHMIN00,PARM=NEW
     //SYSRACF DD   DSN=SYS1.RACF,DISP=(NEW,KEEP),
     //        SPACE=(TRK,(30),,CONTIG),
     //        DCB=(RECFM=F,BLKSIZE=1024,DSORG=PSU)

14     Verify module IGC0001C CSECT IEAVTRML (memory
     termination table) in your new SYS1.LPALIB.  Several
     products (eg RMF, IMS, NetView) ZAP it to indicate the
     name of their own routines.  If these routines are not in
     SYS1.LPALIB but rather in LPALST libraries, you should
     ZAP it back to binary zeroes to avoid an S806 abend at
     IPL time.

15     Create the TSO user-id IBMUSER with the following
     batch TSO job:

     //      EXEC PGM=IKJEFT01
     //SYSUADS  DD DISP=SHR,DSN=SYS1.UADS,
     //       UNIT=3380,VOL=SER=MINMVS
     //SYSTSPRT DD SYSOUT=*
     //SYSTSIN  DD *
     ACCOUNT
     A (IBMUSER P A IKJS) JCL OPER ACCT NOMOUNT UNIT(SYSALLDA)
     END

16     Initialize the new SYS1.LOGREC using IFCDIP00.

If you intend to keep your mini MVS system on tape, add the
following two steps.

17     Copy SYS1.SAMPLIB(ADRDMPRS) onto file 1 of an NL
     tape, using LRECL=80,BLKSIZE=80,RECFM=F
     (DF/DSS stand-alone program)

18     Do a DF/DSS full dump of MINMVS onto file 2 of the
     tape.
