SMP/E root cause analysis

How often in the past have you run an SMP/E process and,
when it has failed, had problems because the diagnostic
information returned is not detailed enough to identify the
problem? Well, a new Small Programming Enhancement (SPE)
named 'Root Cause Analysis' has been developed to create a
report known as the 'Causer SYSMOD Summary' to overcome
problems when an SMP/E process fails.

The report provides a summary of the messages describing the
errors that have caused the failure. This filters out messages
which normally only confuse diagnosis. The other
enhancement made by this SPE is to the SYSMOD status
report. This details the id of the SYSMOD causing the failure,
and provides information on SYSMODs that were processed
successfully as well as those that have failed. Many of the
messages associated with failures have been modified to
provide more succinct information.

The SPE can be installed by obtaining SYSMOD UR90259 for
FMID HMP1600 and UR90260 for FMID JMP1611. These
FMIDs relate to SMP/E Release 6. When ACCEPT, APPLY,
and RESTORE commands are executed the new SPE is
invoked. Reports will be produced for the following types of
failure:

o      Held SYSMODs
o      Missing requisite SYSMODs
o      Utility SYSMOD failures
o      x37 abends
o      Missing DD statements
o      Allocation errors
o      Id errors
o      JCLIN errors.

Below is an example of the format of the Causer SYSMOD
Report and following it are descriptions of the various fields
produced on the report.

      aaaaaa bbbbb   cccccccccc  dd    eeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeee
where:
o      xxxxxxxx is the SMP/E command being processed, eg
      APPLY, ACCEPT, or RESTORE.

o      CAUSER identifies the SYSMOD whose failure led to the      failure of other SYSMODs.

o      FMID is the FMID for the causer SYSMOD.

o      MESSAGE ID is the message-id number for the message
      describing the error that caused the SYSMOD to fail.

o      PAGE is the page in SMPOUT where the SYSMOD
      failure is located.

o      ERROR/CAUSES provides a summary of the error and a
      list of possible causes.

Figure 1 is an example of such a report for an APPLY process.
