Dynamic non-swappable routine
Sometimes you may need to make a program non-swappable; this requires updating
the CSECT IEFSDPPT in IEFSD060 in SYS1.LPALIB and a re-IPL with CLPA or MLPA.
The following small routine shows an easy way to make your own program non-
swappable without an IPL.  It needs to be link-edited with AC(1) in an
authorised library.
***          N O N - S W A P P A B L E   R O U T I N E           ***
ROTNSWAP DS    0H
         USING ASCB,R3            |ASCB BASE = R3
         L     R3,PSAANEW         |R3 <= @ASCB CURRENT
         USING OUCB,R2            |OUCB BASE = R2
         L     R2,ASCBOUCB        |R2 <=@OUCB
         CLC   OUCBNAME,=C'OUCB'  |VER IF OUCB
         BNZR  R11                |^= -> RETURN
         MODESET KEY=ZERO
         OI    ASCBFLG1,ASCBNSWP  |FLAG FIELD <= X'01'(NON SWAPPABLE)
         OI    OUCBSFL,OUCBNSW    |FORCE NON-SWAPPABLE STATUS
         MODESET KEY=NZERO
         BR    R11                |RETURN
         DROP  R3,R2              |DROP BASES
To make another program non-swappable you have to follow the ASCB chain and find
the job name pertaining to the program you want to make non-swappable (start at
CVTASCBH).  Note that if the program has been swapped out, you may not find it
in the TCB-RB chain.
