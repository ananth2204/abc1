Batch mode SDSF
A facility of SDSF which is not very well documented (in our release at any
rate) is the ability to use SDSF in batch mode.
This is an extremely useful facility because it provides the ability to extract
all manner of information about the state of SPOOL and to direct it to a
dataset.  It is then simply a matter of writing a program to
interrogate/manipulate this data.
As an example, one of our sites was regularly running up against its &MAXJOBS
limit of 9999.  We created an SDSF batch job that provided details of every job
in the system at that time.
A sort of the output by job name and an interrogation program showed that 20% of
&MAXJOBS (almost 2000 jobs) was taken up by the held output from multiple runs
of just two jobs spread over three days (the site automatically purges all held
output older than three days).  However, this output was no longer required
after 5pm on its creation date.
There is now an overnight job which uses batch SDSF and a specially written
program to issue purge commands for the ‘offending’ held output and the &MAXJOBS
problem has disappeared.  An example of an SDSF batch job is as follows:
//jobname JOB  .....................................
//*
//STEPA  EXEC  PGM=IEFBR14
//HASPINDX DD  DSN=&&HASPINDX,DISP=(,PASS),UNIT=....,SPACE=(CYL,2),
//             DCB=(RECFM=FB,LRECL=4096,BLKSIZE=4096)
//*
//STEPB  EXEC  PGM=ISF
//HASPINDX DD  DSN=&&HASPINDX,DISP=(OLD,DELETE)
//ISFOUT   DD  DSN=.....,etc,
//             DCB=(RECFM=FB,LRECL=133,BLKSIZE=....)
//ISFIN    DD  *
PREFIX A
H
++ALL
PREFIX B
H
++ALL
etc.
NOTES
1    The job name must be authorised to use SDSF in the same way as a normal
user.
2    Without the ++ALL command only one screen’s worth of information will be
output.
