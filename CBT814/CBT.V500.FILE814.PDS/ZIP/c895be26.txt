Displaying original NJE job number on output

When an output listing is transmitted from one JES2 NJE node
to another for printing, the originating JES2 job number could
be changed to a different value, if JES2 at the receiving node
determines that the same job number already exists in its spool.
For example, if separate parts of a single job's output are
transmitted at different times from node A to node B and are all
queued for printing, the resulting job numbers at node B will
all be different.  This makes it very inconvenient if not
impossible for operations staff to try to relate the job numbers
printed on the JES2 separator pages with the job numbers
originally transmitted.

To solve this problem at our installation, a modification was
made to the standard JES2 separator page (distributed in the
standard HASPPRPU module) to display the original job
number in the ROOM field of the information line.  Of course,
any other line or print position in the separator page could be
used.  The modification is based on the JCTNOJID field in the
JES2 JCT control block.  The job number from the transmitting
node is kept in the NJE header field, NJHGJID.  At the
receiving end this field is retrieved and saved in the JCTNOJID
field of the JCT when the JCT is initialized by HASPNET (for
SYSOUT receiver) or HASPRDR (for job receiver).

Below is the modification to HASPPRPU packaged in SMP/E
format for JES2 SP 2.2.0.  The modification should also fit
most other releases of JES2 as long as JCTNOJID contains the
original job number.

The following examples of separator page information lines
illustrate the effects of the change.

Before modification:

***A  START JOB 6127 USER01A    001 001 SYS1   LEE              ROOM ........

After modification:

***A  START JOB 6127 USER01A    001 001 SYS1   LEE             $3923$.........

Although this modification has been developed for the standard
separator page, the logic can be easily applied to any other user
coded separator pages.
