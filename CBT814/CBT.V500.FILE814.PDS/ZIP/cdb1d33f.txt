Detecting MVS/XA and MVS/ESA

During the transition to MVS/ESA from MVS/XA it may be
necessary to have dual path code in system exits or utilities
developed in-house.  This may be required to cope with
incompatibilities or other differences between the two versions
of MVS.

To discover which is the version that is currently in use it is
possible to test the following bits in the CVT as shown below.
The first will be on for both XA and ESA indicating the
availability of XA functions.  The second is on for ESA only.
