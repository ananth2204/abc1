JES2 spool utilisation

Have you ever wondered why spool utilisation appears to be higher than you
thought?  In a JES2 environment, the spool space assigned to a job is not made
available for allocation to subsequent jobs until all output for that job has
been printed or purged.

Even a dummy SYSOUT class (ie JES2PARM $$x SYSOUT DUMMY, where DUMMY specifies
that the class will be allocated spool space but will be marked non-printable to
JES2) takes up spool space until all other output for that job has been printed
or purged.  Neither will the use of FREE=CLOSE on output statements make the
spool space available if there is any other output for that job.
One suggestion is to use DUMMY instead of a non-printable SYSOUT class, eg:

//SYSPRINT  DD   DUMMY

Another suggestion for reducing spool utilisation is to set the JES2 parameter
&TGSIZE (number of buffers in a track group) lower than the default value of 30.
In our environment, spool utilisation dropped 40% when &TGSIZE was changed from
30 to 15.  Another site reduced utilisation even further by setting &TGSIZE to
10.
