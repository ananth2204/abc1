Dataset password protection in batch

Our installation used the standard password facility prior to the
use of RACF.  We encountered some problems using the standard
password facility and made changes to MVS in order to make that
environment workable.

SUPPLYING PASSWORDS FOR DATASETS USED BY BATCH JOBS

Martin Hamilton describes a way of supplying passwords via
SDSF (MVS Update, December 1988).  Entering the reply under
SDSF is limited to users authorised to send commands and it is
not applicable to jobs which run while the authorised person is not
logged on to TSO (eg during coffee breaks or at night).

We changed the READPSWD module to read the password for
non-VSAM datasets from the DDNAME field of DD DUMMY
cards instead of reading it from the operator's reply.  The TIOT is
searched for DD DUMMY cards and the changed READPSWD
routine moves the DDNAME to the proper place without issuing a
WTOR.

We used the following ZAP to READPSWD under MVS/XA 2.2:

            INSTEAD OF PROMPTING OPERATOR CONSOLE FOR PASSWORD FOR

            THE PASSWORD IS THE DDNAME AND THE TIOT IS SEARCHED FOR IT.

BYPASSING PASSWORD CHECKING
In order to reference password-protected datasets, one should
supply passwords.  Supplying those passwords is an unrealistic
task, as far as jobs refering to many datasets of different users is
concerned (eg CICS).  We bypassed password protection for
certain jobs (in our installation, all jobs whose job name begins
with 'S49').
This is done by the following ZAPs to SECLOADA and
IFG0195T under MVS/XA 2.2:
++USERMOD(MLSECLO) /*
    MLM OPEN CHANGES IN MODULE SECLOADA.   OPEN.
    CSECT:     SECLOADA.   LOAD MODULE: SECLOADA.

We used the PASSWORD keyword of the job card to eliminate
the unauthorised use of jobs which bypass password protection.
JES2 exit 3 checks for the correct password and flushes the job if
the password is not valid.  If the password is valid it is suppressed
by JES2 exit 3.  The SUBMIT exit adds the password
automatically for jobs submitted by authorised TSO users.
The  ZAPs  cited  above  are  for  MVX/XA  2.2,  but the ZAPs
for  MVS/SP 1.3 are similar, because IBM has not changed the
logic of the standard password facility since the introduction of
RACF.
