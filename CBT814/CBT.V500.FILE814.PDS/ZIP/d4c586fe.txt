Suspending operator communication

We have some TSO users who use the IBM 3270 Workstation
Program SEND/RECEIVE commands to pass large files between
PCs and the mainframe.  Sometimes this process can take two to
three hours to complete and users are frustrated when the
operators use the MVS SEND command because it interrupts the
transmission and locks the terminal, even when PROFILE
NOINTERCOM has been set by the TSO user.  The following
ZAPs, based on MVS/SP 1.3.5, will allow the users to use
PROFILE INTERCOM/NOINTERCOM to control the flow of
incoming messages completely.

SEND 'TEXT',USER=(USER-ID)

When the operators use only the USER operand with SEND, the
system defaults it to high priority.  We ZAP it to low priority and
it will stop sending messages to the user with NOINTERCOM set.

    NAME IEEVSEND IEEVSND6
    VER 0148 47FOB14A
    VER 014C 40000000
    REP 014C 60000000   change to low priority if specify USER=()
    DUMPT IEEVSEND IEEVSND6
SEND 'TEXT'

When the operators use no operand with SEND, the system
defaults it to NOW and it is high priority.  You can ask the
operators to use the LOGON operand instead of no operand, but
we don't think it will be reliable, so we ZAP it to let LOGON be
the default.

    NAME IEEVSEND IEEVSEND
    VER 0030 F3F2,F9F7,F0F0,F0F9   assume LOGON operand
    REP 0030 9618,3006,47F0,B414
    VER 0346 4780,B368
    REP 0346 4780,B02E
    VER 0352 4780,B368
    REP 0352 4780,B02E
    VER 035E 4770,B8AE
    REP 035E 4770,B02E

SEND 'TEXT',NOW OR SEND 'TEXT',ALL

The following ZAPs will cause the use of NOW or ALL to
generate syntax errors.  You don't need to apply the ZAPs if you
want to keep these two operands.
    NAME IEEVSEND IEEVSEND
    VER 03B4 9610,3006       no more NOW
    REP 03B4 47F0,B02E
    VER 03D8 4780,B846       no more ALL
    REP 03D8 4780,B02E
    VER 045E 4780,B846,47F0,B8AE
    REP 045E 4780,B02E,47F0,B02E
    DUMPT IEEVSEND IEEVSEND
