Annual award winners

All the votes are now in for the 1991 MVS Update article of
the year awards.

The article that saved readers' installations most money was
Optimizing the processing of SMF data by Heinz-Jürgen
Heitländer (January 1991). On average, this article saved all
subscribers who sent in a voting paper just under $250 each -
that's equivalent to a total saving of over $400,000 for our total
circulation.

The article that saved readers most time was judged to be
Finding uncatalogued datasets by Ernie Ishman, which also
appeared in the January issue (another article by Ernie Ishman
appears in this month's issue). The average time saved by all
those who returned voting papers was 5.69 hours each -
equivalent to a total saving of almost 10,000 man hours for all
the installations who subscribe to MVS Update.

MVS Update saves the average site $3337 and just under 127
hours a year. Not surprisingly, it was January's issue which
saved readers the most money (an average saving of over $514)
and the most time (16.64 hours on average).

The purpose of these awards, which were introduced in 1989,
is twofold - to give public recognition to the authors and to
enable us to tailor MVS Update more accurately to the needs of
our subscribers by concentrating more on the types of article
you have indicated are of most benefit to your installations.

If you feel that you could contribute an article but are unsure of
how to go about it, please contact the editor, Steve Piggott,
through any of the addresses shown on page 2 for a free copy
of our Notes for contributors.

We extend our congratulations to Heinz-Jürgen Heitländer and
Ernie Ishman - your $2000 prizes are on their way to you now.
Our thanks go to all our readers who took the trouble to vote.
