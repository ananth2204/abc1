Determining the current MPF list suffix

In our installation we make extensive use of the Message
Processing Facility (MPF).  We do all our message suppression
from here, as well as using some exits to provide additional
functionality.  We have a separate MPF list for unattended
operations which we can switch in using the 'T MPF=xx'
command.  However, when we issue the D MPF command to
determine the current MPF we get about six pages of output
(all the suppressed message-ids), when all we need is the two-
character suffix.

The following program implements a simple TSO command,
MPF, to display the current MPF suffix.  We also use the code
in this program within some of our MPF exits to take different
actions if we are running unattended.  Assemble and link-edit
this program into an ISPLLIB library (we used MPF as the
name of the program).  We added MPF to our ISPCMDS
member of ISPTLIB to implement it as a TSO command.  Be
sure to use AMODE (31), RMODE (ANY) when link-editing
this program.  We have implemented this under MVS/XA 2.2.
