Concatenation

One of IBM's DFP development team called to update me on
my understanding of concatenation of datasets.  The statement
that the block size of any concatenated library cannot exceed
the block size of SYS1.LPALIB and SYS1.LINKLIB (page
34, MVS Update, September 1989) no longer holds true and
this is no longer a restriction for DFP Version 2.3 and above.
