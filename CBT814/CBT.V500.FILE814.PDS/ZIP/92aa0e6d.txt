Making RMF service values machine-dependent 

The RMF workload activity report displays machine-independent 
service accumulation values for the control and report 
performance groups defined via the IEAIPSxx SYS1.PARMLIB 
member in an MVS system.  While this report is useful for 
comparing relative resource consumption profiles for different 
workloads, it is sometimes more meaningful to express these 
values conventionally, eg as  CPU seconds, CPU percentage 
utilisation, I/O counts.  Since the workload activity report 
includes everything necessary to derive the conventional values, 
the task of doing so is quite straightforward.

SRVCNV is a program that carries out the desired conversions.  It 
reads a workload activity report created with RECFM=VA or 
VBA and converts CPU and I/O service values; the former to 
seconds and per centage utilisation, and the latter to I/O counts.  
In the case of CPUs, note that both service and converted values 
are in terms of the capacity of a single engine within the CPU and 
must thus be divided by the number of engines to obtain the value 
for the CPU as a whole.

SRVCNV does not report converted MSO service values.  The
