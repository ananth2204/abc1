JES2 1.3.6 without the TCB expansion feature
In order to run JES2 1.3.6 on an MVS/370 system IBM states that the base control
program must be at either level 1.3.3 with the TCB expansion feature JBB1337
installed on top or, alternatively, at base control program level 1.3.5, which
includes the expanded TCB support.  It is possible with five source statement
changes to run JES2 1.3.6 on MVS 1.3.3 thus avoiding installing the TCB
expansion feature or upgrading MVS to level 1.3.5.
What JES2 1.3.6 uses in the expanded TCB is the field TCBBDT where it stores a
pointer to the DTE.  Since the field TCBUSER is unused by JES2 anyway, change
all references to TCBBDT to TCBUSER.  TCBBDT is only referenced once in
HASPSSSM, HASPCNVT, and HASPDYN.  Furthermore, HASPSSSM looks for an ACEE
pointer (RACF access control block) both from its old position in the ASXB and
from a new field, TCBSENV, in the expanded part of the TCB.  Since the ACEE
pointer from the ASXB is valid at level 1.3.3 of MVS, the use of TCBSENV can be
disabled without any side effects.
In HASPSSSM the original relevant instructions are:
***      ICM   R1,B'1111',TCBBDT-TCB(R1)  GET DTE ADDRESS          …136 0750510
         ICM   R1,B'1111',X'14C'(R1)  GET DTE ADDRESS              …136 0750520
*        ICM   R15,B'1111",TCBSENV      TASK ACEE PRESENT ...  …OZ81051 6299290
         ICM   R15,B'1111',X'154'(R15)  TASK ACEE PRESENT ...  …OZ81051 6299300
         BNZ   HO020                YES, GO PROPAGATE INFO     …OZ81051 6299310
Change the uncommented instructions to the following:
         ICM   R1,B'1111',TCBUSER(R1)  GET DTE ADDRESS     USE TCBUSER  0750520
*        ICM   R15,B'1111',X'154'(R15)  TASK ACEE PRESENT     DISABLED  6299300
*        BNZ   HO020                YES, GO PROPAGATE INFO    DISABLED  6299310
In HASPCNVT the original relevant instructions are:
***      L     R8,TCBBDT-TCB(,R8)  GET ADDRESS OF DTE              …136 2324000
         L     R8,X'14C'(,R8)      GET ADDRESS OF DTE              …136 2325000
Change the uncommented instruction to the following:
         L     R8,TCBUSER(,R8)     GET ADDRESS OF DTE      USE TCBUSER  2325000
In HASPDYN the original relevant instructions are:
***      ST    R7,TCBBDT-TCB(,R1)  SAVE DTE ADDRESS IN TCB         …136 1249000
         ST    R7,X'14C'(,R1)       SAVE DTE ADDRESS IN TCB        …136 1250000
Change the uncommented instruction to the following:
         ST    R7,TCBUSER(,R1)      SAVE DTE ADDRESS IN TCB USE TCBUSER 1250000
When this is done re-assemble the three JES modules and re-link JES2.  With the
above modifications, JES2 1.3.6 was set into production on MVS/370 1.3.3 without
the TCB expansion feature and has run without problems.
