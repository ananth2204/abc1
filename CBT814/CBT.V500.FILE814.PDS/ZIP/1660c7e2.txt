Suppressing the TSO full screen log-on panel

This article details a method that can be used to suppress the
TSO full screen log-on panel.  The article A TSO log-on pre-
prompt exit by Karel Bastiaansen (MVS Update, Issue 47,
August 1990) covered an exit routine that could also be used to
perform this function.  While Mr Bastiaansen's method is more
flexible, if you just want to suppress the panel altogether for all
users, the following AMASPZAP job can be used to do this.  It
has been successfully implemented on an MVS/XA 2.2.3
system.

//AMASPZAP1    EXEC    PGM=AMASPZAP
//SYSPRINT     DD      SYSOUT=*
//SYSLIB       DD      DSN=SYS1.LPALIB,DISP=SHR
