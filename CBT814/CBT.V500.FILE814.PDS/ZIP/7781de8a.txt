Dataset services security exit

Employing a very simple DFDSS authorization exit provides
controls for two important characteristics of DFDSS execution.
First, the exit provides an emergency dump/restore capability in
an unsecured environment, and, second, it reduces unnecessary
DFDSS overhead in a non-SMS environment.

DFDSS, now repackaged as part of DFSMS/MVS 1.1 as the
DFSMSdss component, has undergone a metamorphosis to
provide support for SMS. A major update to DFDSS 2.5 was the
additional security functionality provided by PTF UN33484
(APAR PN03077). IBM's design for SMS is based on rules that
are maintained in a security database. For DFDSS to be SMS
aware, it must ask permission of the security system whenever it
wants to process a volume or dataset. Additional information on
the new DFDSS security functionality can be found in the
DFDSS Update Guide (SC35-0146).

What if there is no active security product (ie RACF, CA-ACF2,
or CA-TOP SECRET) in the MVS under which DFDSS is
executing? The answer is, quite simply, DFDSS will not function:
no back-ups, no restores. This was a problem for our shop which
maintains a disaster recovery MVS system which is IPLable from
a single self-contained 3380. To reduce the complexity of
maintenance and space requirements of our emergency RES
pack, no security package is installed there. If an attempt is made
to execute DFDSS on such a system, DFDSS will issue the
following messages and terminate:

      ADR402E AUTHORIZATION CHECK FAILED FOR DATA SET
      ADR308E ACCESS DENIED FOR VOLUME

There are two ways to disable the enhanced security checking
now being performed by DFDSS. The first method is described in
the DFDSS Update Guide. Figure 2 of that manual indicates that
we need to code a SYS1.PARMLIB SCHEDxx PPT entry for an
authorized program with NOPASS. This authorized program
would then, in turn, make appropriate calls to DFDSS. This is a
complex programming problem, and is not suitable because of our
requirement that the emergency RES pack be as simple to use
and maintain as possible.

The alternative, which is to employ the DFDSS security exit
ADRUPSWD, is very simple. In this case, the exit is to bypass all
authorization checking, so the exit must set register 15 to zero.
The exit is documented in Chapter 6 of the DFDSS Reference
Manual (SC26-4389).

Security administrators may object to employing ADRUPSWD
to bypass all DFDSS authorization checking. We are able to do
so because we have an alternative method to secure the use of
DFDSS. In our case, we use CA-TOP SECRET to permit
programs beginning with ADR (such as ADRDSSU) to systems
programmers and production back-up users only. All other users
in the system cannot execute the DFDSS utilities. This is possible
because we are not an SMS shop.
