Dynamically making programs APF authorised

The following procedure should work under any release of MVS.


INTRODUCTION

The standard way of making programs APF authorised is to link them into an
authorised library specified in the SYS1.PARMLIB member IEAAPFnn with the link-
edit attribute of AC=1.  Changes to such library specifications will require a
re-IPL.


TSO/E AND AUTHORISED PROGRAMS

If authorised programs are to be executed under TSO, they must be put into a
table in the Link Pack Area:  TSO commands go into table IKJEFTE2 and called
programs go into IKJEFTE8.  Any changes to these tables require a re-IPL with
the CLPA option to make them effective.

It is, therefore, convenient to be able to turn on and off APF authorisation
dynamically for any program that does not have the AC=1 attribute, in any
library upon request.

Just be aware that this can be a security exposure.


THE SOLUTION

The method is to have a user SVC that sets or removes the APF bit in the control
block JSCB.  This SVC is probably well known but it is, together with the
following two macros, a pre-requisite to many homegrown functions that help to
make life easier.

The following SVC can be enhanced by adding installation-dependent security
checks.


THE SVC

*     AUTHORISATION SVC 235 TYPE 4
*       R0 = 1 TURNS ON AUTH
*       R0 NE 1 TURNS OFF AUTH
*     REGISTERS AT ENTRY INTO SVC
*       R3 => CVT
*       R4 => USER'S TCB
*       R5 => SVC'S SVRB
*       R6 => MODULE START (BASE REGISTER)
*       R7 => USER'S ASCB
*       R14 => RETURN ADDRESS
         IKJTCB
         IEZJSCB
IGC0023E CSECT
         USING IGC0023E,R6              BASE REGISTER
         USING TCB,R4                   TCB ADDRESSING
         USING IEZJSCB,R2               JSCB ADDRESSING
         L     R2,TCBJSCB               GET ADDR OF JSCB
         BCT   0,AUTHOFF                R0 NOT = 1 REQUESTS AUTH OFF
         OI    JSCBOPTS,JSCBAUTH        SET JSCBAUTH ON
         B     RETURN                   THEN RETURN
AUTHOFF  EQU   *
         NI    JSCBOPTS,255-JSCBAUTH    TURN AUTH OFF
RETURN   EQU   *
         BR    R14                      RETURN
         END


THE AUTHON MACRO

The AUTHON macro invokes the SVC to turn on APF authorisation.

         MACRO
&NAME    AUTHON
         LA    R0,1                     REQUEST AUTH
         SVC   235                      REQUEST AUTH
         MEND


THE AUTHOFF MACRO

The AUTHOFF macro invokes the SVC to turn off APF authorisation.

         MACRO
&NAME    AUTHOFF
         SR    R0,R0                    TURN OFF AUTH
         SVC   235                      TURN OFF AUTH
         MEND

Using the two macros shown above makes it easy to change the SVC number.
