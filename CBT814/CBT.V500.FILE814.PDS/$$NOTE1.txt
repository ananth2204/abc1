Hi Sam

Here is a larger file of MVS XEPHON articles which may still have
some value to ASM programmers.

I saved/collected these files long time ago - over 10 years ago

I assume it would be a good idea to put em onto the CBT Tape too
especially since all of them are NOT in the silly PDF XEPHON
format as of 2000.

These files are all in TEXT format (not XMIT).  Using the
mvsa.htm file allows a user directly to jump onto each article.

Please setup the comment that they were downloaded those days
ASIS without ANY modification and I do not take any
responsibility for it nor do I support any of that code nor did I
test em.

All code was written by others - hence all the credit goes to the
ones who contributed their work to XEPHON those days.

I hope you find this valuable too.   In case you already have
that stuff - simply delete this email. Let me know.

Cheers
Eugene Vogt
