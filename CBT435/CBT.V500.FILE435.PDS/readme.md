//***FILE 435 is from David North of Los Angeles, California        *   FILE 435
//*           and is a Fixed Blocked LRECL=80 conversion of         *   FILE 435
//*           Frank Clarke's REXX execs that are on File 433.       *   FILE 435
//*           Frank's execs are in VB-255 format.                   *   FILE 435
//*                                                                 *   FILE 435
//*           This conversion was performed with David North's      *   FILE 435
//*           utilities that are on File 155.  After the            *   FILE 435
//*           conversion, the execs were still in VB-255 format,    *   FILE 435
//*           but the lines were folded so they fit into an         *   FILE 435
//*           80-byte width.  I copied the members over to an       *   FILE 435
//*           actual FB-80 dataset.  (SG - 11/99)                   *   FILE 435
