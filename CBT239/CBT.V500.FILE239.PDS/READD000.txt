  All the DD cards%ARE OPTIONAL+. You DO NOT%HAVE TO+allocate any.

  However you may wish to allocate the following DD cards:
  -%REAPRINT+- Reasm uses this DD card as the internal PRINT file. In case
        you did not allocate this DD card REASM will do it for you.
        Internal allocation will create:
       %//REAPRINT DD SPACE=(TRK,(5,10)),DCB=BLKSIZE=3000+

  -%REASMSAV+- This DD card may define the recovery data set. In case
               you did not allocate this DD card REASM will do it for you.
               This data set may be sequential or partitional. Recfm, Lrecl and
               Blksize are not relevant (Blksize must be not equal to ZERO).

  -%REASMBLK+- This DD card may describe load library containing REASM control
               blocks. You should allocate this DD card to the %REASM.CNTL+
               library to be able to restore formatted blocks.
