    -%@Name+      - Name of the DSECT block. This is a way to set the base
register for predefined control block or user defined DSECT. Once Reasm
receives such operand it tries to find the appropriate control block in the
load library, defined by the DD card REASMBLK. If the block is found then Reasm
loads it and sets a base.  In future all the references to the fields in this
control block will be translated to the names from the control block
description.  Reasm will accept also the comments related to the control block
fields.
                    === Example ===
                   %USING @CVT,R3+  - Set base for control block 'CVT'.
                                      If the command was:
                                     %TM  116(R3),X'13'+
                                      then its new form will be:
                                     %TM  CVTDCB,X'13'   OPERATING SYSTEM ...+
                   %USING ?,2       - Bring up the member list of blocks
