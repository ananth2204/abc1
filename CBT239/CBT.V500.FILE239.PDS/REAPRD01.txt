   Once you delete the register, the following actions will performed by Reasm
automatically:

   - If deleting reg was the base for text (not for the control block or user
     DSECT) then all the corresponding labels will be deleted from the project.

   - If deleting reg was the base for user DSECT then DSECT will be destroyed.

   - If deleting reg was the base for control block then BLOCK will be freed.

   Examples:
    %DROP   R3+ - Erase Reg3 from the project
    %D      15+ - Erase Reg15.
    %D     ALL+ - Erase all the base registers
