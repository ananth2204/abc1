    Reasm was initially developed in 1985 in the former USSR by Valentin
Chernyak. Since that time it was significantly changed and improved.

    I am glad to thank my friends. This product was changed a lot of times to
follow their valuable remarks. A lot of advices were made by:

  - Jornitski Vladimir             --- currently in USA

  - Konnikov  Arkady               --- currently in Russia
