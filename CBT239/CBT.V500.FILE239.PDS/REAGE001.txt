     Reasm provides a special 'control block' feature which allows you prepare
sources, using MVS control blocks definitions. You may define your own blocks
to make restoring programs much more readable.

     Reasm is friendly for novices and qualified users. You may prepare an
excellent source or make the draft one. In any rate it is the perfect tool for
disassembling.
