    REASM makes it possible to restore sources using previousely prepared
control block definitions. A special utility (PRCBGEN) shipped together with
REASM converts standard assembler DSECT definitions into the corresponding load
modules which may be used by the REASM. Load library%REASM.CNTL+shipped
together with the REASM contains prepared load modules for majority of the
popular MVS blocks.

    To keep this library up to date and to refresh it you may use the JCL
examples which may be found in the library%REASM.USER+
