   You are able to overtype any label in the project. Once you did it all
references to the label will be automatically changed in all the commands in
the project. This feature usually increases the readability fantastically.

   You are able to erase any label. If there remained any references to the
erased label Reasm will restore the label back.

   You may change the first sign of label to asterisk (*). This label will
still exist in the project but all the references to it will be changed to the
nearest previous label plus offset. This facility allows you drop "junk" labels
(offsets within the logical block or so).
