  -%Second+operand of the USING command defines the number of the base
register.  You may specify ANY number of register (from 0 to 15). Hopefully
register 0 should be used ONLY to base the predefined control block%@PSA.+

    You may type number of register as decimal digit or as combination%"Rxx".+

  -%Third+(optional) operand of USING command may define the displacement in
the project where the assembler USING command should be put. As the default it
will appear at the offset equal to the first operand.  Offset3 must be entered
in hexadecimal, like Offset1.  Instead of typing Offset3 you may show the
necessary place by cursor. Assembler command USING will be put before the row
where the cursor occurred.
