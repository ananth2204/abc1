   You may put any comment at any row in the text. Comments entered will be
displayed on the screen, they will appear in the listing and in the saved
assembler text.

   Reasm provides its own comments for various commands and combinations.
Look carefully: some of them are NOT obvious !

   Of course you may overtype any Reasm comment by yours. If you decide later
to restore Reasm's comment just erase yours and old comment will be back.

   Length of the comment field may vary (depending on the operands length).
