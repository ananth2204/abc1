    -%@Name#      - If the specified name is not the name of predefined control
block then Reasm assumes user DSECT. Reasm creates the dummy section image and
begins to fill it with the fields program is referring to. All the references
to DSECT fields are translated to the names such as "NNNxxxxx" or "NNN+yyyy",
where%"NNN" #is three first bytes of the DSECT name, %"xxxxx"# is the
hexadecimal offset of the field, %"yyyy"#is the decimal offset of the field.
You may choose the format via primary command%DSECT.# You may customize names
in the user DSECT via the primary command%SET.#
                    === Example ===
                   %USING    @DSA,R13# - set base reg13 for user DSECT 'DSA'.
                    Command %L    R13,4(R13)# will be translated to
                            %L    R13,DSA+4# or %L    R13,DSA00004#

         %NOTE#     You can not define two user dsects with the same 3 first
                    characters of the name !
