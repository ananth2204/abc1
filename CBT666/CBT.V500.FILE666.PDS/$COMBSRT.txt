Comb Sort

    (COBOL)  The comb sort algorithm is an extended bubble sort
    that outperforms the basic bubble sort and is very simple to
    implement.  This program reads in 10,000 records from SYSIN,
    sorts them, and prints the sort time and sorted records on
    SYSOUT.  Under Hercules the times I saw were around 5/100ths
    of a second to sort the 10,000 randomly generated test
    records.  The COBOL source is in member COMBSORT.  (A slightly
    cleaner implementation with inline perform statements is also
    included as member COMBSRTC, but of course it will not compile
    with the MVT compiler).
