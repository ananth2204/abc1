//***FILE 234 is from Dick Thornton, who is the author of the       *   FILE 234
//*           DISASSEMBLER program on File 217.  This is a rewrite  *   FILE 234
//*           of the disassembler to be able to handle load modules *   FILE 234
//*           which are in PDSE's as well as those in PDS'es, and   *   FILE 234
//*           it has been updated to use IBM's IEWBIND and IEWBUFF  *   FILE 234
//*           macros to do the load module access.                  *   FILE 234
//*                                                                 *   FILE 234
//*      Fixed by Joe Reichman to allow disassembly by              *   FILE 234
//*      entry point names, and also to fix a "bug",                *   FILE 234
//*      in disassembling "Halfword Immediate" instructions         *   FILE 234
//*      of the form xHI with negative number operands.             *   FILE 234
//*                                                                 *   FILE 234
//*      The disassembler will now also include ENTRY (entry        *   FILE 234
//*      point) assembler instructions in the disassembled code.    *   FILE 234
//*                                                                 *   FILE 234

//*      The following statements are from Dick Thornton:           *   FILE 234
//*                                                                 *   FILE 234
//*      This is a new disassembler that can be used to             *   FILE 234
//*      disassemble load modules in PDSE's as well as those in     *   FILE 234
//*      traditional PDS's.  It also can disassemble the more       *   FILE 234
//*      recent instructions that have been added to the IBM        *   FILE 234
//*      mainframe instruction set since my earlier disassembler    *   FILE 234
//*      that was written in 1977 and is now in File 217 of the     *   FILE 234
//*      CBT tape.                                                  *   FILE 234

//*      I did not include DSECT statements in this version         *   FILE 234
//*      partly because I have not found them very useful, and      *   FILE 234
//*      partly due to time pressure, as I plan to retire June      *   FILE 234
//*      30, 2002.                                                  *   FILE 234
