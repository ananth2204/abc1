Hi!

Some months ago I wrote a cobol pgm to calculate the percentage
and the amount of the reserved words of a cobol source.

Maybe it could be useful to someone.

Attached I am sending you the JCL to run the pgm and the pgm itself.
All the code is properly commented. I believe it's easy to follow.

By the way, I love the site, thanks for everything!

Best regards,
Cristian
