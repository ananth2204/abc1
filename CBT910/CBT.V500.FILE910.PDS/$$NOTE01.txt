Hi Sam,

I am living in Switzerland, self-employed and at the same time
working for a software company (RSD). I used my company
email (tfa@rsd.com) because apparently my regular email address
(tfalissard@hotmail.com) does not reach you (emails from it
probably go to your spam folder or are blocked by your provider...)

The product is freeware, I imagine that a future version (with
Sysplex support) will one day be chargeable, but this is not on
the cards for the time being...  If you intend to wrap it as a
CBTTAPE file, it can easily be done, it consists of one XMIT
file, that may be downloaded from www.nosqlz.com.

My purpose was to provide a very cheap and easy to use DBMS that
might be used for special projects (big data?) or specific
applications that need not SQL or IBM's usual (expensive) DBMSs.
Of course, it is a "rough-and-ready" product, not very
sophisticated, but it serves the intended purpose. It has no link
with the RSD company.  It took one year of work of my own.

Feel free to ask any question you want, by e-mail.

Hi Sam,

I have a new freeware product that might enter the CBT tape,
although I don't provide any source code:

Do as you see fit!
