We are proud to introduce NoSQLz, a new DBMS on z/OS.

It enables you to manage key-value schema-less tables; data is
"format-agnostic". NoSQLz can be used through function calls in
application programs written in Cobol, assembler, REXX, etc.

NoSQLz belongs to the NoSQL system family. Only basic CRUD
functions (create, read, update, delete) are provided. It is
designed to be very straightforward and easy to implement.

ACID properties are provided, so as to have "real transactions",
through optimistic concurrency control, timestamp-based
concurrency control and multiversion concurrency control (MVCC);
retrieval is always favored, at the (possible) expense of
updates.

Record size varies from 500 bytes (minimum) to 75 MB (large
records supported). There can be up to approximately
1,000,000,000 records in a single table.

The current version of the product is issued as freeware (for a
monoplex); only the full Sysplex version will be chargeable.

In the the full Sysplex version, tables are designed for multiple
concurrent access natively throughout the sysplex, with no need
for VSAM record-level sharing (RLS) support in the sysplex, nor
for any specific coupling or locking mechanism; only a minimal
implementation of a sysplex will be required.

Usages: big data; highly-available data; data warehousing;
document store; Internet applications; OLAP; quick alternative to
existing relational DBMSs; etc.
