//***FILE 910 is from Thierry Falissard and contains a DBMS         *   FILE 910
//*           system called NoSQLz.  See the introduction below,    *   FILE 910
//*           and see the included PDF documentation for any        *   FILE 910
//*           particulars (member #USERGDE).                        *   FILE 910
//*                                                                 *   FILE 910
//*           website:  www.nosqlz.com                              *   FILE 910
//*                                                                 *   FILE 910
//*     We are proud to introduce NoSQLz, a new DBMS on z/OS.       *   FILE 910
//*                                                                 *   FILE 910
//*     It enables you to manage key-value schema-less tables;      *   FILE 910
//*     data is "format-agnostic". NoSQLz can be used through       *   FILE 910
//*     function calls in application programs written in           *   FILE 910
//*     Cobol, assembler, REXX, etc.                                *   FILE 910
//*                                                                 *   FILE 910
//*     NoSQLz belongs to the NoSQL system family. Only basic       *   FILE 910
//*     CRUD functions (create, read, update, delete) are           *   FILE 910
//*     provided. It is designed to be very straightforward and     *   FILE 910
//*     easy to implement.                                          *   FILE 910
//*                                                                 *   FILE 910
//*     ACID properties are provided, so as to have "real           *   FILE 910
//*     transactions", through optimistic concurrency control,      *   FILE 910
//*     timestamp-based concurrency control and multiversion        *   FILE 910
//*     concurrency control (MVCC); retrieval is always             *   FILE 910
//*     favored, at the (possible) expense of updates.              *   FILE 910
//*                                                                 *   FILE 910
//*     Record size varies from 500 bytes (minimum) to 75 MB        *   FILE 910
//*     (large records supported). There can be up to               *   FILE 910
//*     approximately 1,000,000,000 records in a single table.      *   FILE 910
//*                                                                 *   FILE 910
//*     The current version of the product is issued as             *   FILE 910
//*     freeware (for a monoplex); only the full Sysplex            *   FILE 910
//*     version will be chargeable.                                 *   FILE 910
//*                                                                 *   FILE 910
//*     In the the full Sysplex version, tables are designed        *   FILE 910
//*     for multiple concurrent access natively throughout the      *   FILE 910
//*     sysplex, with no need for VSAM record-level sharing         *   FILE 910
//*     (RLS) support in the sysplex, nor for any specific          *   FILE 910
//*     coupling or locking mechanism; only a minimal               *   FILE 910
//*     implementation of a sysplex will be required.               *   FILE 910
//*                                                                 *   FILE 910
//*     Usages:  big data; highly-available data; data              *   FILE 910
//*     warehousing; document store; Internet applications;         *   FILE 910
//*     OLAP; quick alternative to existing relational DBMSs;       *   FILE 910
//*     etc.                                                        *   FILE 910
//*                                                                 *   FILE 910
