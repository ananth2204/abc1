A few notes about running the W$$MGCR program.

Sample JCL:

You have to run the program with a PARM starting with MGCR=, as
follows:  (The command immediately follows the string MGCR=.)

//STEPLIB  DD  DISP=SHR,DSN=your.auth.loadlib
//VARYOFF EXEC PGM=W$$MGCR,PARM='MGCR=VARY 28F,OFFLINE'

I have turned off the jobname tests at labels PARMOK2 and ISITSTC,
by branching around the "jobname-specific" code, but I have left
the code in there, below, so you can use it as a model if you need
it.
