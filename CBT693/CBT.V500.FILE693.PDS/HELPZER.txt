               dsname   = THE DATASET NAME TO BE EMPTIED.  MUST BE A
                          PDS OR A PDS/E FILE (MUST BE DSORG=PO OR
                          POE).
                          THE DSNAME MUST BE FULLY QUALIFIED AND DOES
                          NOT NEED TO BE ENCLOSED IN TIC MARKS OR

                          IS NOT NECESSARY IF EXCLUSIVE CONTROL OF

                          RETURN CODE IS RETURNED.  NO MESSAGES ARE
                          DISPLAYED ON THE CONSOLE.

                 DEBUG  = THE PARAMETER WHICH DISPLAYS THE EXEC
