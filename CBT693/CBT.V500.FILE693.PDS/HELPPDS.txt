)F FUNCTION - PERFORMS THREE FUNCTIONS FOR PDS AND          V01.01.07
              PDS/E DATASETS:

   1)  CLEANS (EMPTIES) PDS AND PDSE DATASETS
   2)  INCREASES THE DIRECTORY BLOCK ALLOCATION VALUE FOR PDS DATASETS
   3)  COMPRESSES PDS DATASETS


   THIS PROGRAM WAS PICKED UP FROM THE CBT TAPE (CBT FILE 040 FROM
   PEOPLES NATIONAL BANK OF WASHINGTON).

   ADDED CODE TO CLEAN A PDS/E AND CHANGE THE INPUT TO A SYSIN FILE.
   ADDED CODE TO CHANGE THE INPUT TO PROCESSING A SYSIN FILE.
                               - TKMILLE/RLRICE 09/01/2004
   ADDED CODE TO COMPRESS A PDS OR PDS/E LIBRARY.
                               - TKMILLE        10/27/2004
   CHANGED THE PROGRAM TO BE REENTRANT AND AMODE 31.
                               - TKMILLE        06/09/2009

   THIS PROGRAM WILL PERFORM THREE (3) FUNCTIONS:
   1) REINITIALIZE ONE OR MORE PARTIONED DATASETS (OR PDSE'S)
   2) INCREASE THE NUMBER OF DIRECTORY BLOCKS FOR A PARTITIONED
      DATASET.
   3) COMPRESS A PDS DATASET.

   BY REINITIALIZE IT IS MEANT THAT THE DIRECTORY BLOCKS WILL
   BE REWRITTEN TO ZEROS AND THE NEXT AVAILABLE POINTER RESET
   TO THE START OF THE DIRECTORY.
   ALSO THE NEXT AVAILABLE DATA AREA POINTER IS RESET TO FOLLOW
   DIRECTORY AREA.
   THE ADVANTAGE OF THIS METHOD IS THAT THE DATA SET
   DOES NOT HAVE TO BE SCRATCHED AND REALLOCATED THEREBY
   PRESERVING THE ALLOCATED AREA (SECONDARY EXTENTS ARE NOT RELEASED)
   THIS EFFECTIVELY ACCOMPLISHES A COMPRESS OF THE EMPTY DATASET.

   FOR PDS/E DATASETS, THE STOW MACRO IS USED TO INITIALIZE
   THE MEMBERS OF THE DATASET.  IF IBM APAR OA13224 IS NOT APPLIED
   ON THE RUNNING SYSTEM, THEN THE DISPOSITION IN THE JCL MUST
   BE SET TO EITHER DISP=MOD OR DISP=OLD FOR PDS/E DATASETS.
   HOWEVER, IF THIS APAR IS APPLIED, THE DISPOSITION CAN BE DISP=SHR
   FOR PDSE's. THIS APAR DOES NOT AFFECT PDS DATASETS. HOWEVER,
   IT IS A GOOD IDEA TO USE THESE DISPOSTIONS FOR PDS DATASETS
   AS WELL.

   INPUT SYSIN RECORDS IN ONE OF THESE THREE COMMAND FORMATS:
   (THE FUNCTION VERB CAN START IN ANY COLUMN)

   ZErodir  DDNAME
   COmpress DDNAME
   ALterdir DDNAME +NNNN  (WHERE NNNN IS ADDITIONAL DIRECTORY BLOCKS
                           NNNN IS A NUMERIC NUMBER FROM 1-8 DIGITS.
                           NEGATIVE DIRBLKS VALUES ARE NOT ALLOWED.
                           NNNN CAN ALSO BE CODED WITHOUT THE '+'
                           SIGN.)

   THE FOLLOWING DDNAMES MUST BE ADDED TO THE JCL WHEN USING
   THE 'ALTERDIR' OR 'COMPRESS' FUNCTION.  THESE 3 ADDITIONAL DDNAMES
   ARE USED TO CALL IEBCOPY TO UNLOAD/RELOAD THE PDS MEMBERS:

   //UNLOAD   DD UNIT=SYSALLDA,SPACE=(CYL,(050,050))
   //SYSUT1   DD UNIT=SYSALLDA,SPACE=(CYL,(050,050))
   //SYSUT2   DD UNIT=SYSALLDA,SPACE=(CYL,(050,050))

   THE 'ALTERDIR' COMMAND FUNCTION ALSO COMPRESSES PDS DATASETS USING
   'IEBCOPY' UNLOAD/RELOAD TO/FROM A TEMP FILE.  IT IS THEREFORE A
   GOOD IDEA TO USE DISP=OLD ON THE FILE ALLOCATION FOR 'ALTERDIR'
   AND 'COMPRESS' FUNCTIONS.

   IF THE IEBCOPY RELOAD PROCESS FAILS FOR LACK OF SPACE TO RELOAD
   THE MEMBERS, THE DIRECTORY BLOCKS ARE RESET TO THEIR ORIGINAL
   ALLOCATION VALUE AND THE PDS IS RELOADED WITH THE UNLOAD IMAGE
   TO RESTORE THE PDS TO ITS ORIGINAL STATE (SEE RECOV_FL).

   THE NUMBER OF DIRECTORY BLOCKS CAN BE INCREASED (NOT DECREASED)
   BY RESPECIFYING THE ADDITIONAL AMOUNT OF BLOCKS ON THE 'ALTERDIR'
   STATEMENT (DOES NOT APPLY TO PDS/ES).

   SAMPLE JCL:
   //PDSCLEAN EXEC PGM=PDSCLEAN
   //SYSPRINT DD SYSOUT=*
   //$SYSPRT$ DD SYSOUT=*
   //SYSUDUMP DD SYSOUT=*
   //DD1      DD DISP=OLD,DSN=MY.PDS1
   //DD2      DD DISP=OLD,DSN=MY.PDS2
   //DD3      DD DISP=OLD,DSN=MY.PDSE1
   //DD4      DD DISP=SHR,DSN=MY.PDSE2    DISP=SHR OK WITH APAR OA13224
   //DD5      DD DISP=OLD,DSN=MY.PDS3
   //DD6      DD DISP=OLD,DSN=MY.UNCOMPR.PDS
   //UNLOAD   DD UNIT=SYSALLDA,SPACE=(CYL,(050,050))
   //SYSUT1   DD UNIT=SYSALLDA,SPACE=(CYL,(050,050))
   //SYSUT2   DD UNIT=SYSALLDA,SPACE=(CYL,(050,050))
   //SYSIN    DD *
      ZERODIR  DD1
      ZE       DD2
      ALTERDIR DD2 +7
      ZERODIR  DD3
      ZERODIR  DD4
      AL       DD5  6
      COMPRESS DD5
      CO       DD6
      ALTERDIR DD6 +0    (SAME EFFECT AS A COMPRESS)
   /*

   NOTES:
    (1) IN THE SAMPLE JCL LISTED ABOVE, DDNAMES
        "DD1", "DD2", "DD3" AND "DD4" WILL BE CLEANED (EMPTIED).
        (DDNAMES "DD3" AND "DD4" ARE PDSES).
    (2) DDNAME "DD2" WILL ALSO HAVE ITS DIRECTORY BLOCK ALLOCATION
        VALUE CHANGE TO OLD ALLOCATION VALUE + 7 BLOCKS.
    (3) DDNAME "DD5" WILL ALSO HAVE ITS DIRECTORY BLOCK ALLOCATION
        VALUE CHANGE TO OLD ALLOCATION VALUE + 6 BLOCKS.
    (4) YOU CANNOT SPECIFY A NEGATIVE DIRECTORY BLOCK CHANGE ON THE
        'ALTERDIR' COMMAND STATEMENT.
    (5) YOU CANNOT USE ANY OF THE FOLLOWING DDNAMES WITH YOUR
        COMMANDS BECAUSE THEY ARE ALREADY USED BY PDSCLEAN:
           UNLOAD  SYSUT1  SYSUT2
    (6) THE COMMANDS 'EMPTYO' AND 'EMPTY' CAN BE USED IN LIEU OF
        'ZERODIR'.  THESE ARE ALIASES THAT SOME PEOPLE ARE USED TO
        USING IN PLACE OF 'ZERODIR'.
    (7) DISP=OLD MUST BE USED TO 'ZERODIR' PDS/E DATASETS UNLESS APAR
        OA13224 IS APPLIED.  HOWEVER, THIS SHOULD BE USED WITH PDS
        AND PDS/E FILES ANYWAY (WHETHER USING 'ALTERDIR', 'COMPRESS',
        OR 'ZERODIR'), BUT IT IS NOT MANDATORY.
    (8) IF A DIRECTORY BLOCKS VALUE IS CODED ON THE 'ZERODIR'
        COMMAND, IT IS IGNORED.
    (9) COMMENTS ARE ALLOWED TO BE CODED AFTER THE COMMANDS.  THESE
        MUST BE DELIMITED WITH A TRAILING BLANK BEHIND THE COMMAND.
        BLANK LINES ARE ALSO ALLOWED.  OTHER THAN THIS, COMMENTS ARE
        NOT ALLOWED IN THE FORM OF LEADING "/*" OR "*".
