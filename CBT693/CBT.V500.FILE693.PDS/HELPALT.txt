   SYNTAX  -  ALTERDIR  dsname  #dirblks [Force] [Debug]

   INPUT
   PARMS:

               dsname  = THE DATASET NAME TO BE ALTERED.  MUST BE A
                         PDS FILE. CANNOT BE A PDS/E FILE, AS THESE
                         FILE MANAGE THEIR OWN DIRECTORIES.  MUST
                         BE DSORG=PO.
                         THE DSNAME MUST BE FULLY QUALIFIED AND DOES
                         NOT NEED TO BE ENCLOSED IN TIC MARKS OR
                         QUOTES.  THEY WILL BE IGNORED IF THEY ARE
                         INCLUDED.  THIS PARAMETER IS REQUIRED.

             #DIRBLKS  = SPECIFIES THE NUMBER (+NNNN) OF ADDITIONAL
                         DIRECTORY BLOCKS TO ADD.  THIS
                         NUMBER MUST BE NUMERIC AND CANNOT BE
                         NEGATIVE NUMBER. IT MUST BE FROM 1 TO 8
                         NUMERIC DIGITS (A WHOLE NUMBER).  THE
                         LEADING "+" (PLUS) SIGN IS NOT NECESSARY,
                         BUT CAN BE USED FOR CLARITY FOR THE USER.
                         THIS PARAMETER IS REQUIRED.

                FORCE  = THIS IS AN OPTIONAL KEYWORD PARAMETER USED
                         TO FORCE THE EXCUTION OF AN ALTERDIR
                         COMMAND EVEN IF EXCLUSIVE CONTROL OF THE
                         RESOURCE CANNOT BE OBTAINED.  USE OF FORCE
                         IS NOT NECESSARY IF EXCLUSIVE CONTROL OF
                         THE RESOURCE CAN BE OBTAINED. THIS PARAMETER
                         MUST FOLLOW BOTH THE DSNAME AND THE #DIRBLKS
                         PARAMETERS.
                         THIS PARAMETER SHOULD BE USED WITH CAUTION.
                         EXCLUSIVE SERIALIZATION IS THE SAFEST WAY
                         TO ENSURE DATA INTEGRITY OF THE RESOURCE
                         FOR ALL USERS.

                DEBUG  = THE PARAMETER WHICH DISPLAYS THE EXEC
                         STATEMENTS AS THEY ARE BEING EXECUTED.
                         THIS PARAMETER IS OPTIONAL AND USED FOR
                         DEBUGGING PURPOSES. THIS PARAMETER MUST
                         FOLLOW BOTH THE DSNAME AND THE #DIRBLKS
                         PARAMETERS.

   OUTPUT PARMS:

          RC (RETURN CODE) IS PASSED TO THE CALLING EXEC OR CLIST.
          (REFERENCE &LASTCC IN A CLIST, RC IN A REXX EXEC).


    RETURN CODES FROM THE ALTERDIR EXEC:

    0     => SUCCESSFUL CALL TO PROGRAM PDSCLEAN VIA ALTERDIR EXEC
    4     => MINOR ERROR IN PROGRAM PDSCLEAN FROM ALTERDIR PARMS
    8     => RETURN CODE 8 CAN BE RETURNED FOR ANY OF THE FOLLOWING
             SITUATIONS:
             COMMAND IS MISSING OR INVALID FROM THE ALTERDIR EXEC.
             DSNAME IS MISSING OR INVALID (2ND PARAMETER)
             DIRECTORY BLOCKS VALUE IS MISSING OR INVALID (3RD PARM)
             RECEIVED A BAD RETURN CODE FROM THE STOW MACRO
             TRIED TO ISSUE 'ALTERDIR' FUNCTION AGAINST A PDS/E DSN
             DDNAME SPECIFIED ON PARM PASSED TO PDSCLEAN IS NOT IN THE
               TIOT TABLE (THIS ERROR SHOULD NOT OCCUR).
             THE RESOURCE COULD NOT BE EXCLUSIVELY SERIALIZED AND THE
               FORCE PARAMETER WAS NOT USED.
    12    => INVALID REXX EXEC COMMAND
    16    => SEVERE ERROR - TERMINATES ALL SYSIN PROCESSING

   EXAMPLE CALLS:

    ALTERDIR MY.PDS     +5
    ALTERDIR MY.PDS3     0    (SAME EFFECT AS A COMPRESS)
