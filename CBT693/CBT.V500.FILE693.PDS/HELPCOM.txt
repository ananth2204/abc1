   SYNTAX  -  COMPRESS  dsname  [Force] [Debug]

   INPUT
   PARMS:

             COMPRESS   = THE COMMAND TO INVOKE THIS EXEC.
                          THIS MUST BE THE FIRST PARAMETER !

               dsname   = THE DATASET NAME TO BE ALTERED.  MUST BE A
                          PDS FILE (PO). SHOULD NOT BE A PDSE (POE), AS
                          THESE FILES MANAGE THEIR OWN DIRECTORIES (PDSE
                          FILES ARE IGNORED WITH A RETURN CODE ZERO).
                          THE DSNAME MUST BE FULLY QUALIFIED AND DOES
                          NOT NEED TO BE ENCLOSED IN TIC MARKS OR
                          QUOTES.  THEY WILL BE IGNORED IF THEY ARE
                          INCLUDED.  THIS PARAMETER IS REQUIRED.

                FORCE   = THIS IS AN OPTIONAL KEYWORD PARAMETER USED
                          TO FORCE THE EXCUTION OF A COMPRESS
                          COMMAND EVEN IF EXCLUSIVE CONTROL OF THE
                          RESOURCE CANNOT BE OBTAINED.  USE OF FORCE
                          IS NOT NECESSARY IF EXCLUSIVE CONTROL OF
                          THE RESOURCE CAN BE OBTAINED. THIS
                          PARAMETER MUST FOLLOW THE DSNAME PARAMETER.
                          THIS PARAMETER SHOULD BE USED WITH CAUTION.
                          EXCLUSIVE SERIALIZATION IS THE SAFEST WAY
                          TO ENSURE DATA INTEGRITY OF THE RESOURCE
                          FOR ALL USERS.

                 DEBUG  = THE PARAMETER WHICH DISPLAYS THE EXEC
                          STATEMENTS AS THEY ARE BEING EXECUTED.
                          THIS PARAMETER IS OPTIONAL AND USED FOR
                          DEBUGGING PURPOSES. THIS PARAMETER MUST
                          FOLLOW THE DSNAME PARAMETER.
