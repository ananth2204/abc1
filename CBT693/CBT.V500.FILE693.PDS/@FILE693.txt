//***FILE 693 is from Terry K. Miller and Richard L. Rice, and      *   FILE 693
//*           contains a modernized version of the PDSCLEAN program *   FILE 693
//*           from CBT Tape File 040.  This version of PDSCLEAN     *   FILE 693
//*           can be used to empty either a PDS or a PDS/E of all   *   FILE 693
//*           its members, and it can also be used to expand the    *   FILE 693
//*           number of directory blocks in a PDS, and it can be    *   FILE 693
//*           used to compress a PDS dataset.                       *   FILE 693
