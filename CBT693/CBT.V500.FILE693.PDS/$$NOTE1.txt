This is a note from author Terry Miller about the 11/16/04 version
of this package, and the PDSCLEAN program.  (S.GOLOB)

Sam,

I have finalized my IVP Test for this File 693 bundle.

I have also cleaned up a couple of items in the code. I made
the following changes to the bundle:

1)  For the following error message, I changed the processing in
     the source code to issue a RC 8 .  Formerly, I was issuing a
     RC 16 and  terminating the program for this error.

     Since it was not necessary to terminate the program or to be
     so severe on the person for this error, I made the code
     change.  Here is the error message for which I made this
     change:

              **YOU MUST USE DISP=OLD OR DISP=MOD
              WITH PDS/E DATASET ALLOCATIONS!

     This is a requrement is a limitation placed upon the STOW
     macro by IBM.  The program uses the STOW macro to initialize
     (empty)

      PDS/Es.   IBM reguires that the PDS/E be opened as OUTPUT
      and must be allocated with either DISP=OLD or DISP=MOD.

2)   I changed the code to allow blank lines.  The program
     ignores blank lines and treats them as comment lines.

3)   I updated the IVP Test member.  I am now happy with it.  It
     tests everything that I can think of.

4)   I updated the HELPPDS member to document treating blank
      SYSIN records as comments.  This is the help member for the
      PDSCLEAN program.

5)  I updated the SAMPRPT (Sample Report) member to show the new
     report headings (with the modification level included).

6)  I updated the $$DOC member to show the latest modification
     level of the source code.

I tested this code yesterday and this morning and I am quite
content with publishing it.

I have attached a new zipped bundle and the source code (2nd
attachment).
