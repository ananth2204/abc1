How to use the AMORT program.

This program creates a payment schedule (for a mortgage or car
payments or corporate loan payments or the like), based on the
following factors:

1-  The interest rate
2-  The amount of the principal
3-  The amount of each payment
4-  The total number of (monthly) payments

Required for each run:   the interest rate

For the other 3 factors, if you supply two of them, the program
will produce a schedule showing the third factor.

Thus, the type of run you want, is classified into "Job type".

For example:  (Remember that the interest rate ALWAYS has to be
               supplied)

Job Type: 1-  Given monthly payment amount and number of payments
              Program supplies:   - total principal paid

Job Type: 2-  Given total principal and number of payments
              Program supplies:   - monthly payment amounts

Job Type: 3-  Given total principal and monthly payment amount
              desired
              Program supplies:   - length of the loan
              (number of payments)

Values are entered in the PARM field of the EXEC statement as
shown below.  In addition, you HAVE TO ENTER THE JOB TYPE as the
first parameter (the format is also shown below, in detail).

Author's further description:

 THIS PROGRAM CREATES A SCHEDULE OF AMORTIZATION PAYMENTS
  WHEN INFORMATION IS SUPPLIED VIA A PARM FIELD AT THE TIME
   OF EXECUTION.  AFTER ALL VALUES HAVE BEEN VERIFIED,
    THE PROGRAM THEN PERFORMS 1 OF 3 DIFFERENT CALCULATIONS:

  JOB TYPE-1 - CALCULATES THE AMOUNT OF PRINCIPAL TO BE BORROWED
    (WHEN MONTHLY PAYMENT AMOUNT AND # OF PAYMENTS IS PROVIDED)

  JOB TYPE-2 - CALCULATES THE MONTHLY PAYMENT AMOUNT
    (WHEN PRINCIPAL AND # OF PAYMENTS IS PROVIDED)

  JOB TYPE-3 - CALCULATES LENGTH OF LOAN IN NUMBER OF PAYMENTS
    (WHEN PRINCIPAL AND MONTHLY PAYMENT AMOUNT IS PROVIDED)

 VALID VALUES MUST ALWAYS APPEAR IN THE PARM AREA

  1. THE JOB TYPE MUST ALWAYS BE A VALUE OF 1 OR 2 OR 3
      NO EXCEPTIONS

  2. THE PRINCIPAL MUST ALWAYS BE A 9-DIGIT NUMBER
      IN DOLLARS ONLY    - BUT CAN BE ZERO ONLY WHEN JOB TYPE 1

  3. THE MONTHLY PAYMENT AMOUNT MUST ALWAYS BE A 9-DIGIT NUMBER
      IN DOLLARS & CENTS - BUT CAN BE ZERO ONLY WHEN JOB TYPE 2

  4. LENGTH OF LOAN IS TOTAL OF MONTHLY PAYMENTS
      (YEARS PLUS MONTHS)
      BOTH YY & MM MUST BE NUMERIC AND TOTAL CANNOT EXCEED 1200
       BUT CAN BE A TOTAL OF ZERO ONLY WHEN JOB TYPE 3

  NOTE: LENGTH IS CALCULATED AS YEARS PLUS MONTHS (FOR EXAMPLE)
        2 YRS + 0 MOS = 1 YR + 12 MOS = 0 YRS + 24 MOS
        2 YRS + 6 MOS = 1 YR + 18 MOS = 0 YRS + 30 MOS

  5. THE ANNUAL INTEREST RATE MUST ALWAYS BE > +0 AND
      MUST RANGE FROM .00001 TO .99999 FOR ALL JOB TYPES
