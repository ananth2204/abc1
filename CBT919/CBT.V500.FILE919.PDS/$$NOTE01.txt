This is the first update for BASH 4.2 on the CBTTape site.

The data set characteristics were changed from FB/80 to VB/255 to
accomodate the $$UPDATE member, which contains the comment portion from
all of the BASH 4.2 patches, 001 through 053 which were available at the
time this distribution was created.

This version is for BASH 4.2.53 and has all of the patches which were
current as of 2014-10-05T23:01:00Z (that's 11:01 P.M. GMT time on 05 Oct
2014 for you civilians).  In particular, this includes the patch, -048,
for the SHELLSHOCK exploit.

The patches themselves, in their entirety, are in the UNIX subdirectory
with the names "bash42-*.patch". The $$UPDATE member in this library is
basically the comments from those patch files.  These patches were
downloaded from ftp://ftp.gnu.org/gnu/bash/bash-4.2-patches .
