I had to regenerate the y.tab.c file from parse.y for z/OS. Normally, this
is done with the yacc program. Unfortunately, the IBM yacc was not able
to process the parse.y file correctly. I had to use GNU bison. Luckily,
the version available from IBM at
ftp://public.dhe.ibm.com/s390/zos/tools/diffutils/diffutils.pax.Z.bin
runs on z/OS 2.1 and can properly process this file. If you need to
change parse.y for some reason, you will need to download bison.  In
addition, you must run bison in "yacc" mode. You do this by including
the -d and -y options.
E.g. $bison -d -y parse.y
You might want to include the following alias in your .bashrc on z/OS:
alias yacc='bison -d -y'

In addition, to be more Linux compatible, you need to put the contents
of the INPUTRC member into the UNIX file /etc/inputrc. This sets up some
of the extra PC keyboard keys (HOME, Delete, etc) correctly.
