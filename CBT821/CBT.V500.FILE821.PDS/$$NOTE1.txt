Hi,

I am a system programmer at Sapiens,

developped at Sapiens as an inhouse utility.

CC is an easy-to-use ISPF edit macro that allows you to easily
duplicate selected sections of a skeleton file with data from
another file.

Attached please find the Contributed CC utility CC.xmt file.

I have also attached the PDF file that contains the utility
documentation. this PDF is included within the xmt file as well.
