//***FILE 818 is from Petr Svoboda and contains an Assembler        *   FILE 818
//*           stub to call AMODE64 modules from AMODE31 modules     *   FILE 818
//*           in COBOL.                                             *   FILE 818

//*     I searched several free webpages about calling AMODE64      *   FILE 818
//*     modules from AMODE31 modules eg. from COBOL....  I found    *   FILE 818
//*     nothing, so I wrote a small Assembler stub for this.        *   FILE 818
//*     It is used in test phase by one of our customers.  I        *   FILE 818
//*     think it might be good idea to allow others to use it       *   FILE 818
//*     and your page seems to be the best choice!!                 *   FILE 818
//*                                                                 *   FILE 818
