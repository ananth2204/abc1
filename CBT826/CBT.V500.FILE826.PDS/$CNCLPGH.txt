CNCLPG 1.2.10E - Alter Characteristics of a Running Address Space

  * -----  ALWAYS DO A DISPLAY FIRST  ----- *
Syntax:  CNCLPG jobname ASID(hhhh) FUNCtion
   Function is:  CNCL, NCNC, FORC, NFRC, NSWP,
   SWAP, MEMT, NMEM, TSWP, or COUNT.
 FSWP, BURN, or KILL are dangerous.
   TSWP will do a TRANSWAP.
Or code CSCB or DISP to just display CSCB entries.
   DISPlay or CSCB will display CSCB chain entries,
   without changing them.
-----------------------------------------------
 When affecting a job, we must affect the CORRECT job,
  therefore you should use the DISPlay option first.
-----------------------------------------------
 To display the whole CSCB, code - (dash) for JOBNAME.
 To see this help message, code ? for JOBNAME.
-----------------------------------------------
** NOTES (IMPORTANT) :  ** BE SURE TO READ THIS **
-----------------------------------------------
 CSCB (DISP) display for an ASID shows ALL occurrences
  for that ASID, regardless of JOBNAME.
 CSCB (DISP) display for a JOBNAME shows ALL occurrences
  for those JOBNAME characters, regardless of ASID.
 CNCL, NCNC, FORC, NFRC, NSWP, SWAP changes the FIRST
  entry in the CSCB chain that matches, if multiple
  entries exist. But DISP will display ALL applicable
  matching entries in the CSCB chain, so you can see
  which one you want to change specifically.
 When you code BOTH jobname AND asid, to CHANGE it,
  then ONLY that specific job and asid gets changed.
