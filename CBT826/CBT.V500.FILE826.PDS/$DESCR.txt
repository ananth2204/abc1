Notes about the CNCLPG TSO command:


The CNCLPG TSO command is an APF-authorized command (which has to
appear in the IKJEFTE2 table (AUTHCMD)) and which will make an address
space Cancelable, Non-Cancelable, Forcible, or Non-Forcible.  Also,
Non-swappaple or Swappable.

With later releases, CNCLPG can do much more.  See the SYNTAX below.

Since this is a standalone command and is not part of any other
package, it is transportable between shops and you can use it
anywhere.  It is (of course) also FREE and Public Domain.

Authority required:  As coded, the TSO user needs PSCB OPER authority.
                     For BURN and KILL, PSCB ACCOUNT authority is
                     needed in addition to OPER.  You can add more
                     authority checking according to shop requirements.

  SYNTAX:     TSO Command:  APF-authorized.

           |                   |CSCB or DISP (display CSCB blks)
           |                   |BURN (memterm the address space)
           |                   |KILL (do memterm after turning
           |                   |      off non-memtermable bits)
           |                   |NMEM|MEMT  (turn on/off
           |                   |        non-memtermable bits)
           |                   |COUNT  (display DONTSWAP count)
           |-  (displays the entire CSCB chain)
           |?  (displays help)

    The first parameter of the command is the "jobname" field.

    In this first field, you can put the Jobname to change, or
    an ASID(nnnn), or a dash (-) for a display of the entire
    CSCB chain of address spaces, or a ? for help.

    The field after the jobname, ASID(hhhh) or both,
    is a command field.

    There are "action" commands and "display" commands.

    Action  commands are:  CNCL, NCNC, FORC, NFRC, NSWP, SWAP,
                           BURN, KILL, TSWP, FSWP. NMEM, MEMT

    Display commands are:  CSCB or DISP

    Action commands will change only the FIRST entry encountered.

    Display commands will show ALL eligible entries satisfying
    equality with the stated parameters: jobname, ASID(hhhh),
    or both.

    Therefore, to do an action, it is recommended to do display
    commands first, to narrow down the choice of job to exactly
    the ONE ADDRESS SPACE that you want to change.  Usually you
    have to do this by specifying BOTH jobname and ASID(hhhh)
    for that particular job, when you issue an "action" command.

    There, you tell the program what to do with the chosen
    address space (make it cancelable, non-cancelable,
    forcible, or non-forcible, swappable, or non-swappable).

    Probably the best thing to do is to say CSCB or DISP to
    display all the jobnames and address spaces that match the
    chosen combination, and then you can try to change only
    the exact jobname and address space number combination.

    For the following examples, please note that CNCLPG
    is at level 1.2.10E now.

    Example:   tsov cnclpg sbgolob disp

    Result:

    You see that there are two address spaces with name SBGOLOB,
one has ASID(0051) and the other has ASID(004D).  To change the
one we want to change, that is, the one with ASID(0051), you want
to code both parameters:

    CNCLPG SBGOLOB ASID(51) NCNC (or whichever of the commands)

The result of this command is:

    It may be surprising, but on some systems, there are two
distinct entries on the CSCB table with the same ASID.  I didn't
know that, but here they are:  You see that each entry has
different properties.

    CNCLPG ASID(3B) DISP

    So the idea is, that you should use DISP to show you what
entries are in the CSCB chain with regard to your job, and then
be very specific, using both jobname and asid, when you are
making your changes.

    Best of luck to all of you.  Use this utility in good health!
And THINK before you change anything.....!!!
