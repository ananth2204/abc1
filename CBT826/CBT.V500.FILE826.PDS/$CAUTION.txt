Note about CNCLPG version 1.2.6.         C A U T I O N
           ------         -----          -------------

The current release, 1.2.10E is higher than 1.2.6.

CNCLPG version 1.2.6 contains the undocumented capability of
being able to BURN an address space, which is like a FORCE.
The burn can be done, without the address space being either
cancelable or forcible.  The BURN is done via a CALLRTM macro
with TYPE=MEMTERM.  KILL is the same as BURN, except that if
the job is really NON-FORCIBLE in that the ASCB "no MEMTERM"
bit(s) are set, KILL will turn these bits off before doing
the MEMTERM, so it will be sure(r) to get rid of the address
space.  (Whack it, baby...!!!)

Sometimes it is necessary for a systems programmer to
surgically remove an address space from the system, if it is
not functioning properly, and to restart it afterwards.  This
is what the BURN function is for.  It is to be used VERY VERY
CAREFULLY, AND ONLY WHEN ABSOLUTELY NEEDED.  Same for KILL.

Since, when you do a BURN on an address space, you remove it,
this is kind of dangerous.  Therefore ALWAYS run a DISPlay
function before running a BURN, and ALWAYS use the ASID(nnnn)
parameter of CNCLPG so that you know BOTH the full jobname
and the ASID of the job, to be absolutely definite that THIS
is the address space you want to BURN, and NOT ANY OTHER !!!!!
Same for KILL......

Please note that as the program is currently coded, if you do
a partial jobname, like JES2, other jobnames like JES2AUX and
JES2MON are also included in the CSCB search, and the name
JES2 does not necessarily come out first in the search of the
CSCB.  Therefore, using the ASID(nnnn) parameter is IMPERATIVE
when you are doing a BURN, so you get the EXACT address space
and not the wrong one.  Same for KILL.....

This feature is not found in CNCLPG version 1.2.0.  The "5"
is an indicator that this feature is present in your version
of the CNCLPG program.  "6" for KILL.  Version is 1.2.6.

Good luck.  BE VERY VERY VERY CAREFUL........
