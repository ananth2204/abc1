//***FILE 826 is from Sam Golob and contains a FREE TSO command to  *   FILE 826
//*           alter the status of an address space, by making it    *   FILE 826
//*           Cancelable or Non-Cancelable, Non-Memtermable (can't  *   FILE 826
//*           be FORCEd), Memtermable, Swappable, Non-Swappable.    *   FILE 826
//*           (Also if FORCE needs a CANCEL).  Joe Reichman put     *   FILE 826
//*           in Swappable and Non-Swappable for any address space. *   FILE 826
//*           This command is one of the very rare FREE commands    *   FILE 826
//*           (APF-authorized) which can make any address space     *   FILE 826
//*           non-swappable or swappable.  Thanks, Joe!             *   FILE 826

//*           The current version can TRANSWAP any address space,   *   FILE 826
//*           (function TSWP) and can display the count of noswap   *   FILE 826
//*           requests (function COUNT--and others).  You have to   *   FILE 826
//*           be very careful to use TRANSWAP only when necessary.  *   FILE 826

//*           Sometimes there are multiple DONTSWAP actions         *   FILE 826
//*           against an address space.  To turn them all off,      *   FILE 826
//*           and make the address space SWAPPABLE, use FSWP        *   FILE 826
//*           (or Forced SWAP).  Otherwise run the SWAP action      *   FILE 826
//*           multiple times (FSWP eliminates that problem).        *   FILE 826
//*           But use FSWP very carefully, because there might      *   FILE 826
//*           be multiple reasons why the address space is          *   FILE 826
//*           currently nonswappable.  This is only an emergency    *   FILE 826

//*           To use the CNCLPG TSO command, you first find the     *   FILE 826
