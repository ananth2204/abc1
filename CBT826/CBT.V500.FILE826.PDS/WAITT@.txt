)F FUNCTION -

  The WAITT command allows you to adjust your job's or TSO
  session's wait time, by adjusting the ASCBSWTL field in
  the ASCB.  Optionally, you can turn on, or off, exemption
  from step timing altogether.

  The way the program is coded:

     The minimum wait time is 900   seconds.
     The maximum wait time is 65535 seconds.

  And you can code any number in between.
