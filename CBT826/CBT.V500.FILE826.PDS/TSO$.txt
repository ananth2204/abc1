The TSOB, TSOE, TSOV, and TSOR commands from Mark Zelden:


    Trappable output from TSO commands, which has been produced
by the PUTLINE interface (as opposed to the TPUT interface) can
be captured and REDISPLAYED IN SCROLLABLE FORM.  This is the
purpose of the above commands:

TSOB  -  Capture TSO output and BROWSE it.

TSOE  -  Capture TSO output and EDIT it.

TSOV  -  Capture TSO output and VIEW it.

TSOR  -  Capture TSO output and REVIEW it, using the REVIEW TSO
         fullscreen command from CBT Tape File 134.

    To use these, type:

ÝTSO¨ TSOx COMMAND parameters ....

where if you are on an ISPF command line, you have to prefix
a TSO command with the word "TSO".

    Try em.  You'll like em.

    All the best of everything........
