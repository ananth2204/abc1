The member PAX contains the REXX scripts (and a few other files).
Member PAX is in the format of a PAX backup, therefore you will need to
issue a PAX command (while in OMVS) to perform the restore. Just follow
these instructions:

 1) Enter into OMVS. This can be done from ISPF by issuing the command
    of "TSO OMVS" or from the =6 utility screen and issuing "OMVS".

 2) Get to the folder to where you initally plan to restore these files.
    It doen't have to be your final destination, just maybe a temporary
    folder. You get to this folder by issuing the UNIX "CD" command.
    For example:

      CD /usr/lpp/internet/server_root/cgi-bin

 3) Once you mavigate to your desired folder, issue the UNIX PAX command
    that will restore the files that are contained in member PAX. An
    example of this command is:

      pax -tvz -rf"//'name.of.this.pds(PAX)'"

    This command must be executed while in an OMVS session.
