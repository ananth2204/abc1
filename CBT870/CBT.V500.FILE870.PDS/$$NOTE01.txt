The attached will eventually restore down to the following REXX
scripts and Word documents.  These scripts were created to be
executed within a Z/OS HTTP (the default HTTP, not Websphere) USS
environment.  They aid in retrieving and displaying information
from and to the user's browser.  A slightly more detailed
description follows.  The PDS that this XMIT file eventually
becomes, will contain the following members:

$$INDEX  - And explanation of the other members
$CONTACT   a Way to contact me for questions
$DOC   The information that follows in this email
$INSTALL   how to restore the PAX member
PAX  - a PAX file containing the following files

Once you have executed the $INSTALL instructions, you should be
able to view several REXX scripts which are briefly discussed in
the following:

These scripts are mainly used within a Z/OS USS (Unix System
Services) HTTP "cgi-bin" environment. I've only used these in the
standard default HTTP arena. I have never tried them within
Websphere.

------------------------------------------------------------------

GlobalProcessTemplate.sh

This script provides the ability for a 'cgi-bin' type script to
process HTML, JCL, and email templates with "File Tailoring"
functionality that is normally found in an ISPF environment. Such
as   )SEL and )ENDSEL capability and the like. A more detailed
explanation can be found in document "Script Descriptions.docx"
also located within this same directory.

A variation of this script can be created, that can be used in
batch scripts when you don't wish to execute a batch ISPF session
just to do some file tailoring.


GetVariablesFromClient.sh

The purpose of this script is to process the information that is
sent from the user's browser, back to the script that is
identified in the URL.  When a HTML issues either a "GET" or
"POST" request, the URL might be the name of a script such as:

    http://00.000.00.00/cgi-bin/Script01.sh

If this was a "POST" request, variables are returned to
Script01.sh within a file.  Script01.sh must then retrieve those
variables.   It can easily do this by calling
GetVariablesFromClient.sh. Once GetVariablesFromClient.sh has
been called, all the variables that were in the URL request are
now made into REXX variables of the same name.

To call this script, it is best to just interpret it:

    Interpret 'GetVariablesFromClient'()

In just one instruction, all the variables that are sent from the
browser are now REXX variables.


GlobalXaml01.sh
GlobalXaml02.sh

These scripts provide the means to produce an animated bar chart.
XAML is the language of Silverlight (Microsoft).  XAML is
Microsoft's   answer to SVG.  These scripts only produce XAML
(which is a form of XML) which must then be processed by
Silverlight.  You can find out   more information about
Silverlight at http://www.silverlight.net/.   Your browser must
have had the Silverlight plug-in installed before you will be
able to see an animated bar chart function.

XAML Barchart.doc is a Ms-Word document that describes a batch
version of these scripts.  More documentation can be found within
the scripts  themselves.

This process can get a little confusing but an animated bar chart
from the mainframe is really, really cool.

Script Descriptions.docx

This is an Ms-Word document that describes the scripts that you
should have restored with the PAX command. To view this document,
you  must make it available to your P/C operating system so that
you can open it up with MS-Word.  A way of doing this is to FTP
it (BIN not  ASCII mode) to a drive to which you have access. A
PDF versions is also provided.


XAML Barchart.doc

This is an Ms-Word document that describes a batch version of the
two XAML scripts.  You'll have to read the comments of the
scripts themselves to see how differently their process is. The
batch version was designed to create a XAML text file, but the
XAML scripts, that you just restored, are designed to be executed
within a web environment. The inputs are pretty must the same,
but are different in how they are presented to the script. A PDF
version is also provided.
