Sam,

Would you please look this over to see if it is worth putting on the CBT
Tape?

This is my "virtual tape robot" for z/OS running on a FlexES system.
Please note that I do not have this configuration. The program was
tested on a Linux system by taking a z/OS SYSLOG file, editing it to
"look right" and feeding it into the program.

The file is a TSO XMIT of a PDS (LRECL=80 RECFM=FB) which contains three
members. The first is a documentation member named $DOC.  The second is
sample installation JCL called RECEIVE.  The last is named TARFILE and
contains an XMIT of a z/OS sequential file (LRECL=1 RECFM=FB). This
sequential file is a "tar" archive containing two Linux/UNIX files. The
first is called tape-robot.perl, which is a Perl program which responds
to z/OS "tape mount" messages by finding the FakeTape(tm) volume and
issuing a FlexES "mount" command to "mount" the volume.  The Perl
program captures the z/OS "mount" messages by reading a UNIX FIFO pipe
which is defined in FlexES as a virtual 1403.  This 1403 is defined in
the z/OS system as a console with ROUTCDE(3) assigned to it.  The second
file is tape-robot.cfg which is a configuration file for the
tape-robot.perl program.
