IT IS\n AND  ALIAS  FOR,  AND AN INTEGRAL PART OF, THE PFAULT PROGRAM (QV). IT\n PRODUCES  OUTPUT  SUITABLE AS INPUT TO BOTH THE PULL PROGRAM (QV), AND\n THE TPATH PROGRAM (QV).\n\n    SINCE  IT  IS  BASED  UPON  NUCREF  AND NOT AMBLIST, IT HAS CERTAIN\n RESTRICTIONS  THAT AMBLIST DOES NOT. EG, IT DOES NOT MAP A LOAD MODULE\n THAT  IS  IN OVERLAY FORMAT IN THE SAME MANNER AS DOES AMBLIST; IE, IT\n RECOGNIZES THAT THE LOAD MODULE IS IN OVERLAY, BUT IT DOES NOT SEGMENT\n THE  OUTPUT  AS DOES AMBLIST. HOWEVER, IT WILL GIVE SEGMENT NUMBERS IN\n ITS OUTPUT. THIS IS NOT A SERIOUS RESTRICTION AS PFXREF IS DESIGNED TO\n MAP  THE  NUCLEUS  AND MODULES IN THE FIXED, MODIFIED, AND/OR PAGEABLE\n LINK PACK AREA.\n\n    ANOTHER  RESTRICTION  IS  PFXREF'S USEAGE OF CORE. TO KEEP THE CESD\n ITEMS IN CORE, IT DOES A VARIABLE CONDITIONAL GETMAIN FOR 64K (THIS IS\n SPLIT INTO TWO 32K BUFFERS); IF IT CANNOT GET ALL CESD ITEMS INTO THIS\n AMOUNT  OF CORE, IT DOUBLES THIS AND TRIES AGAIN. IF 128K IS STILL NOT\n ENOUGH, IT TERMINATES PROCESSING OF THE CURRENT CONTROL CARD.\n\n    TO  DO ITS SORTS (BOTH THE CESD ITEMS AND THE CRLD ITEMS ARE SORTED\n BY ADDRESS AND ALPHABETICALLY), IT DOES VARIABLE CONDITIONAL GETMAIN'S\n FOR  40K;  IF  IT  CANNOT  OBTAIN  ANOTHER 40K BLOCK WHEN REQUIRED, IT\n TERMINATES.  SINCE  IT IS AN INTEGRAL PART OF PFAULT, THESE 40K BLOCKS\n ARE  RETAINED  FROM  ONE CONTROL CARD TO THE NEXT - THEY ARE PASSED TO\n PFAULT WHEN PFXREF HAS FINISHED PROCESSING.\n\n    CURRENTLY, THESE TWO RESTRICTIONS ON CORE SIZE DO NOT SEEM TO CAUSE\n SERIOUS  PROBLEMS - TWO 400K NUCLEI, WITH APPROXIMATELY 1200 ESD ITEMS\n APIECE, WERE MAPPED SUCCESSFULLY IN LESS THAN 500K.\n\n    CURRENTLY,  PFXREF  DOES NOT GIVE ANY DATA ON THE AMOUNT OF CORE IT\n HAS USED FOR BUFFERS AND SORTING.\n\n    PFXREF  RUNS  AS A PROBLEM PROGRAM UNDER VS AND REQUIRES NO CHANGES\n TO BE MADE TO VS.\n\n    PFXREF  MAY  BE  INVOKED  IN  THE  STANDARD WAY, PASSING PARAMETERS\n AND/OR ALTERNATE DDNAME'S...SEE THE UTILITIES SRL.\n\n\n1PFXREF: A LOAD MODULE MAPPING PROGRAM                        PAGE    3\n\n\n    JCL REQUIRED TO EXECUTE PFXREF IS STANDARD DATASET UTILITY JCL:\n\n      //STEPNAME EXEC PGM=PFXREF\n      // <,PARM='LINES=|L=NNN,NOEND,KVT|NOEP|EPS'>\n      // <,REGION=XXXXK>\n      //SYSUT2 DD SYSOUT=C<,DCB=BLKSIZE=BBBBB>\n      <//SYSPUNCH DD SYSOUT=B<,DCB=BLKSIZE=PPPPP>>\n      <//SYSOUT DD SYSOUT=B<,DCB=BLKSIZE=PPPPP>>\n      <//STEPLIB DD DSN=D89MSC1.SIMMON.LOAD,DISP=SHR>\n      //SYSLIB DD DSN=DSNAME,DISP=SHR<,DCB=BLKSIZE=ZZZZZ>\n      //SYSIN DD *<,DCB=BLKSIZE=SSSSS>\n      <//SYSIN2 DD *<,DCB=BLKSIZE=SSSSS>>\n\n      WHERE:\n\n           NNN  (LINE  COUNT) IS ANY NUMBER FROM 10 THRU 999.
