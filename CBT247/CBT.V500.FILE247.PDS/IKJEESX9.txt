     At this shop we have been using exit IKJEESX9 (included
below) for years (MVS... through OS/390 1.2). What it does is
allow individual users to have logs rather than using the
SYS1.BRODCAST dataset. I have used this so that most users
continue to use SYS1.BRODCAST while a few heavy users have private
logs. We have preferred this since it keep central control of the
messages and prevents proliferation of many small datasets (which
also tend to get migrated). I have used this in conjunction with
other utilities to monitor SYS1.BRODCAST and keep the situation
under control.

     For reference, we have about 2500 TSO ID's and only about 10
private logs.  These are mostly associated with a few "production"
TSO users who monitor system performance of production jobs.

      It appears that this exit is simply linked into LINKLIB (or
some dataset concatenated to it).  The last time it was installed
here it was linked into our linklib extension.  (I don't know why
it was not put in via SMP/E USERMOD).

     You are welcome to add this exit to your collection of
SYS1.BRODCAST tools if you see fit.

     The exit works by "sensing" when a user log is present. If
one is not present, it simply uses SYS1.BRODCAST. As you can see
the code to do this is amazingly trivial. I wrote this many years
ago and must have been inspired by some piece of IBM
documentation. When I went back later (while installing a later
release) to see if the exit was still valid, I could not find
justification for the technique in the manuals. I tried it (on
releases up to OS/390 1.2) and it has continued to work.
