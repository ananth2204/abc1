Okay,

I already use your brodcast stuff but I downloaded file 247 and
refreshed what I had.  There is a small change that I made that
might be useful for other people.

I leave all of Vinh's stuff in a PDS called dsname.BROADCAST.ISPF
and use this exec to use it:

/* rexx */
/* trace i */
/*********************************************************************/
/*********************************************************************/
address tso "ALTLIB ACT APPL(CLIST) DA('dsname.BRODCAST.ISPF')"
address ispexec "LIBDEF ISPPLIB DATASET ID('dsname.BRODCAST.ISPF')",
                                      " STACK"
address ispexec "SELECT CMD(BCMUTIL)"
address ispexec "LIBDEF ISPPLIB"
address tso "ALTLIB DEACT APPL(CLIST)"

That way, I don't have to add any clists or panels to the logon
procs.  I have not tried to use ISPLLIB for your programs, but
they might work from there.

Brian
