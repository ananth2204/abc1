Note about IKJZT301 thru IKJZT306 macros.

   These macros have been moved from PVTMACS (i.e. Optional Materials)
to SYS1.MACLIB in later releases of OS/390 and in z/OS.

   The reason we have copies of them here, is because you need them to
describe the various records in the SYS1.BRODCAST dataset, and you might
not have PVTMACS, if these macros are not in SYS1.MACLIB on your MVS
version.  We have old, public domain versions of them--however.....

   Comparison of the old free versions we have here, and the z/OS
Release 1.7 versions on SYS1.MACLIB, shows that we have the same code,
except for IKJZT301 (BROADCAST header record).  You can use our versions
to assemble, or you can assemble using IBM's versions from SYS1.MACLIB,
if your system has them on SYS1.MACLIB.  It's nice to know that the
format of SYS1.BRODCAST hasn't changed too much in a long while.  Very
old TSO versions (I think you have to go back to OS/360) don't have the
type X'05' Free Search record.

   One of the real changes that has occurred, affecting the BROADCAST
Dataset externally, comes because of the fact that you can switch
BROADCAST Datasets now, when you do either a PARMLIB UPDATE(xx) TSO
command, or a SET IKJTSO=xx console command, which will update the value
used in the SEND BROADCAST (DATASET(new.dataset.name)) parameter, and so
forth (also to make a volume change, etc.).  So now you can switch to a
different copy of the SYS1.BRODCAST dataset "officially".  But this
hasn't affected the internal format of the BROADCAST header record
itself, or any other BRODCAST dataset record formats.

   What HAS changed significantly (for the BROADCAST header record) is
the fact that the Global Notices which are addressed by the LISTBC
command are now incore.  This is so that many LOGONs which occur at the
same time, and which invoke LISTBC at the same time, won't all access
the SYS1.BRODCAST dataset directly, and cause an enqueue backup.  The
R1GENNUM field is supposed to be updated every time the incore table has
been updated with new Notices, and a new GETMAIN has to be done for that
copy.  This happens usually, when you do an OPER SEND,'  ',SAVE TSO
subcommand, and then you follow it with a LISTBC command (at the TSO/E
version 3.3.0 level or above).  R1GENNUM does not seem to get updated by
my BCMNOTFY command execution, followed by a BCMNUPD and a TSO LISTBC
execution.  The incore table IS updated by my programs, but not
R1GENNUM, either in the incore table or in the BROADCAST dataset itself.

Significant Differences in IKJZT3xx macro versions:

IKJZT301:
--------
Insert the following, immediately after:
R1LEVEL  DS    CL7 -          LEVEL NO. = 'LEVEL N', WHERE 'N' IS
*                               A 1-DIGIT NUMBER

* -------------------------------------------------------------------
         DS    CL1            RESERVED
R1FRESRH DS    CL3            RBA OF FREE SEARCH RECORD
R1GENNUM DS    F              GENERATION NUMBER FOR IN-STORAGE
*                               NOTICE TABLE
         DS    CL76 -         RESERVED
* -------------------------------------------------------------------

Note that CL76 is really the wrong value, because it doesn't take
the fullword alignment of the R1GENNUM field into account, and it
should have been CL73, to make a total record size of 129 instead
of 132 (which overflows the data portion of the Broadcast LRECL.)
But IBM doesn't seem to care, because this overflow doesn't seem to
affect anything operationally.

IKJZT302:      (Only the PL/X section is extra.)
--------

IKJZT303:      (Only the PL/X section is extra.)
--------

IKJZT304:      (Only the PL/X section is extra.)
--------

IKJZT305:      (Only the PL/X section is extra.)
--------

IKJZT306:      (Only the PL/X section is extra.)
