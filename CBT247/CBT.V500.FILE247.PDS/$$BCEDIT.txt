                         BCEDIT COMPONENT
                         ------ ---------

Note:  If you can't get the CONSOLE permissions to update SYS1.BRODCAST
       using the BCEDIT exec, then you can change the $NOTICE clist and
       run it instead.  You will need OPER privilege in TSO.

       There is now more help for this situation.  Updated versions of
       the CPSCB and LPSCB TSO commands are included here.  CPSCB is an
       authorized TSO command, and if you authorize CPSCB and enter:

          CPSCB CONS  and then CPSCB OPER

       then your TSO session will get CONSOLE and then OPER authority.
       Another way (which is more "official") is to create a profile
       called CONSOLE in the TSOAUTH RACF class, and give yourself
       READ access to it.  The next time you LOGON to TSO, LPSCB
       should show that you have CONS authority in the PSCBATR1 field
       at +10 in the PSCB.  Sample LPSCB output for this line:

          +10  PSCBATR1 E500             OPER ACCT JCL CONS RECOVER

The BCEDIT* members of this pds were written by Paul W. Lemons,
and they deal with the NOTICES part of SYS1.BRODCAST.

Three members are necessary:

    Either BCMEDIT or BCMEDITA,

      and

    BCEDITM1 and BCEDITM2.


These members should be put in the SYSPROC or SYSEXEC TSO
concatenation.


BCEDIT reads the NOTICES section of SYS1.BRODCAST, and allows you
to ISPF EDIT and change existing notices.  SEND commands are
formatted by the execs, to replace the old Notices which what you
created with the edit.

    I copied this part of Paul's stuff over from File 479, to
complete this package, and put all the message and Notices handling
stuff in one place.

Please see the BCMN* members of this package, which now also deal
with the NOTICES section of SYS1.BRODCAST.   Sam Golob - 04/19/05
