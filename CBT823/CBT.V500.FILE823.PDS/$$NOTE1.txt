Hi, Sam!

It has turned out that I have been compelled to expand ISPF
Command Shell panel.  I did it successfully and now I have 20
commands in stack.  It is enough at this time.

May be this possibility will useful for you.

In attachment:

ISRTSOA  - ISPF Command Shell panel in XMIT format. It must be
          copied in any customer ISPPLIB library.
DOESHL   - REXX procedure, which fulfils additional command stack
          function. Copy it to customer SYSPROC.
DOECMP   - REXX procedure, which supports compress function for
          expanded stack. Copy it to customer SYSPROC.

With best wishes,
Alexander I. Vasilenko.
