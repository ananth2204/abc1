Further explanation of options for using the command stack in the
ISRTSOA panel.  You can set whatever modes you want to set.  The modes
are settable from the MODE option above the ISPF command line, when
you invoke this panel.  And the current settings of the modes will
display inside the panel itself.

Alexander will explain more below.  You have to play with the
available options and see which settings you prefer.
---------------------------------------------------------------------
Sometimes you want to execute a command from the stack, and have it
disappear from the command line.  Sometimes not.  Alexander explains
below what he prefers, and why he made the modification in the first
place.  (SG)

All fine, Sam!

But I'd like to explain one place.

My preferred mode is  Execute and HOLD No  J
                      -------------------
Now I only choose commands from stack. (Usually we use 7-9
commands to submit a job, so I do not need to modify its).

What do I mean?

I have now all commands I need in my stack. And I can run them
without any modifications (without retrieving them in command
line) just choosing the command in stack and hitting  Enter .
Mode  Execute and Hold NO  lets me do this. It is very comfortable
because I need to repeat many times certain chains of commands for
debugging or testing the application.

Of course, the larger size of the stack lets me contain all my
commands.  It was the second reason why I began with expanding
the command list.

Sorry about the extra J, some words about this.

What was the behavior of ISRTSOA before my modification? (in our site).

I.                   Retrieve mode.

1)      I choose command in stack. Hit  Enter . The command
        appears in command line.

2)      I modify the command if necessary. Hit  Enter . The
        command runs.

3)      After execution the command remains in command line.

II.                  Execute mode.

1)      I choose command in stack. Hit  Enter . The command runs.

2)      After execution copy of the command appears in command
        line.

It was not very convenient because erroneous execution of the
command may have taken place.

By the way.

Some time ago I was in Krasnoyarsk and visited my old work.
Behavior of ISRTSOA I found was different:  THE selected command
was deleted from command line after execution.  May be it is a
version-related difference.

In any case my implementation lets you choose the most comfortable
mode for you.

One more bonus - you always may see the current mode.
