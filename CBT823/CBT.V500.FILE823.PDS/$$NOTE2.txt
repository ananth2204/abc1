Sam.

I forgot to say about two new options in Mode menu    HOLD Yes
and  HOLD No .

It was one of the reasons why I began with expanding the command
list.

In our installation the "just executed" command remains in the
command string.  As we use ISRTSOA panel for job submission, so
duplicate submissions occur sometimes.  To eliminate this I
modified the panel so that the command is blanked out.  But our
Boeing friends did not like this decision.

Thus two new options appeared.

 HOLD Yes  means that executed command remains in command line.
If you use expanded panel at first time, this is default.

 HOLD No  means that the command will be blanked out from the
command line just after execution.

My preferred mode is  Execute and HOLD No.

Now I only choose commands from the stack. (Usually we use 7-9
commands to submit jobs, so for that alone, I did not need
to modify the size of the stack.

There is a good way to control stack contents.  In the
attachment you may find the VIEWPOOL command, that calls
ISPYXD1 panel.  Use Option 3 to display all the variables.

For PDF you may do an Option 7.3 for this but not for other
applications.  VIEWPOOL lets you do it for any application
(you must know the application name of course).

One more note.

I recommend performing a compress function after commands deletion.
I did not test the case when stack has gaps.

Good luck.
