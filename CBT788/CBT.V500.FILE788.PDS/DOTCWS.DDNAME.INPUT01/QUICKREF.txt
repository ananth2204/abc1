                  AbendCd  four character representation of the numeric
                           abend code requested by the calling application
                  JobNm    The name of the job as given on the jobcard
                  JobNb    The job number assigned by JES
                  LMod     The load module being executed, from the
                           EXEC PGM= for the jobstep
                  PgmNm    Self-identification, name passed by the calling

                  Step2    Job step name
                  UserID   The userid submitting the job
                  SysID    SMF sysid of the LPAR on which the job ran

                  If the calling application passed a DB2 SQLCA structure,
                  the formatted SQLCA and attendant error messages will
                  follow the UDOT0001I message.

     User Action: Use the abend code and the source listing for the PgmNm
                  application program to determine the reason the abend
                  was requested.  Correct the error.
