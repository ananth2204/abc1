This application was previously available as the Category 4 MA1K
SupportPac and hosted on IBM's WebSphere MQ SupportPac website.  Changes
in IBM's licensing necessitated withdrawal of the code as a SupportPac.

The purpose of this application is to encapsulate triggered message
processing for MQSeries applications triggered in CICS TS.

Applications that are triggered can call this subroutine and receive
their triggering message. If the triggering message's
MQMD-BACKOUTCOUNT >= the queue's MQIA-BACKOUT-THRESHOLD the "poison"
message will be moved to the queue's MQCA-BACKOUT-REQ-Q-NAME. If the
queue has no MQCA-BACKOUT-REQ-Q-NAME the poison message will be
discarded.

In any case, a message will be written to the system log indicating
what action was taken.

POSSIBLE USES
This application generically encapsulates triggered message
processing, backout processing and error handling for triggered queues
in CICS TS. Adopted as a standard, or used as a base and modified to
create a standard, development time can be reduced and uniform error
handling assured.

CMQV      Rexx program, executable in batch via the JCL included in its
          comments.  Produces a COBOL copybook to be used by J7200502.
          View your hlq.SCSQCOBC(CMQV) member and Cut/Paste the reason
          codes to a new member.  Use the new member as input to this
          Rexx program to get the COBOL copybook.  You do need to do
          this for each new release of MQSeries.

J7200501  COBOL program intended to be called when a CICS error
          occurs.  Translates the CICS RESP code to a readable text
          string which can be included in DISPLAYs or WTOs.
          Dynamically callable from within CICS.

J7200502  COBOL program intended to be called when an MQSeries error
          occurs.  Translates the MQ Reason Code to a readable text
          string which can be included in DISPLAYs or WTOs.
          Dynamically callable from batch or within CICS.

J7200503  COBOL program to return the name of the currently connected
          MQSeries queue manager.
          Dynamically callable within CICS.

J7200506  COBOL program intended to encapsulate the processing for an
          MQSeries triggered program.  Includes logic to retrieve the
          backout queue name and backout threshold and to requeue a
          message if the backout count exceeds the backout threshold.
          WTOs are issued to indicate message requeue has occurred, the
          message identifier - the first four characters of the WTO
          text - should be changed to identify the responsible
          organization.
          Dynamically callable within CICS.

J7200507  COBOL program intended to encapsulate the MQOPEN, MQINQ and
          MQCLOSE for callers requiring information about MQ objects.
          Dynamically callable from batch or within CICS.

J7200508  COBOL program to convert a hex string to a readable format,
          if Input =  x'0123456789ABCDEF' then
             Output = x'F0F1F2F3F4F5F6F7F8F9C1C2C3C4C5C6'
          Dynamically callable from batch or within CICS.

QUICKREF  MVS/QuickRef source for the WTOs issued by some of the
          above applications.  I would strongly suggest changing
          the UDOT prefix on the messages and in the applications to
          something meaningful to your installation.
