Enclosed please find a new submission to the CBT site.

The attached zipfile contains three files.  The first is source
and the second the attendant copybooks for what used to be known
as the Category 4 WebSphere MQ SupportPac MA1K.  This supportpac
used to be hosted by IBM on their website, but changes to IBM's
"agreement" document governing such hosting necessitated its
removal.  These files are XMITted PDSs that were FTP'd binary and
then zipped up.  The last file is MA1KDOC which has further
details about the use of the application and a contact email
address.

I am the original author of the MA1K SupportPac, and would like its
availability to continue.
