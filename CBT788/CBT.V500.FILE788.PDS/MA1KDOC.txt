MA1K Application....

The purpose of this application is to encapsulate triggered message
processing for MQSeries applications triggered in CICS TS.

Applications that are triggered can call this subroutine and receive
their triggering message.  If the triggering message's
MQMD-BACKOUTCOUNT >= the queue's MQIA-BACKOUT-THRESHOLD the "poison"
message will be moved to the queue's MQCA-BACKOUT-REQ-Q-NAME.  If the
queue has no MQCA-BACKOUT-REQ-Q-NAME the poison message will be
discarded.

In any case, a message will be written to the system log indicating
what action was taken.

POSSIBLE USES
This application generically encapsulates triggered message
processing, backout processing and error handling for triggered queues
in CICS TS.  Adopted as a standard, or used as a base and modified to
create a standard, development time can be reduced and uniform error
handling assured.

These source code members presume a minimum CICS TS level of 3.1 and
a minimum WebSphere MQ level of 6.0.
