)AREA INFO
@The#OVER@command can be used to list only those commands which override other
 following commands or are themselves overridden by preceding commands.
@The#NOVER@command lists commands which do not override and are not overridden.

 Overrides can occur only when commands have identical names, or start with the
 same characters.  When those commands are displayed by "ISPF Commands" - each
 command in the list is marked with%'-' '.' '*'@or%'+'@as follows:

 %-$ Overridden command.~CANNOT BE INVOKED directly because a preceding command
                         gets invoked instead.
 %.$ Partly overridden. ~This command is defined with possible truncations, but
                         at least one of them is overridden (and would invoke a
                         preceding command instead of this one).
 %*$ Overriding command.~This command prevents a following command from being
                         directly invoked.
 %+$ Partly overriding. ~This command prevents some, but not all, invocations of
                         a following command.

@Command  Table  Description / Action
§-------  ----- ----------------------------------- @Sorted by§REAL ORDER
%*#ON     $APPL~overrides the following ON command in the same table
§          CMD(ONAGAIN)
%-#ON     $APPL~cannot be invoked, overridden by previous ON command
§          PANEL(ONTOP)
%+#CAN    $APPL~partly overrides CANCEL in the ISPCMDS table
§          CMD(CANDLE)
%*#RIGHT  $APPL~overrides RIGHT and partly overrides RIGID
§  --      &&SCRRIGHT
%.#RIGID  $USER~can be invoked only 'RIGI' or 'RIGID'
§  --      PGM(STIFF)
%-#RIGHT  $ISP ~cannot be invoked. overridden by RIGHT in APPLCMDS table
§          SETVERB
%.#CANCEL $ISP ~can be invoked only by 'CANC', 'CANCE' or 'CANCEL'
§  ---     CANCEL

@An overriding command can be in any command table as long as it is before the
@overridden command in the ISPF search order (ie. 'REAL ORDER').  Even if your
@command list is sorted in a different order (eg. 'COMMAND NAME') - all the
@override markings:%'-' '.' '*'@and%'+'@are still valid.
~
@The$V@line command can be used to see more details about a particular command.
@The full command definition is displayed plus messages listing any commands
@which override this command, and any other commands which are overridden by it.
~
@The$S@line command will invoke commands, even if they are overridden.
~
@The#RES@command will reset this list to ALL commands (in your selected tables).
~
@It's possible for a command to be partly overridden and simultaneously override
@another command.  In such cases - the command will be marked with%'.'
~
@It's possible for a command to simultaneously override one command completely
@and another command partly. In such cases - the command will be marked with%'*'
~
@It's also possible for an overridden command (which can't be directly invoked),
@to be invoked indirectly by another command with an ALIAS action.  See HELP for
@ALIAS for an example.
~
@In the examples above the RIGHT command in table APPLCMDS has Action &&SCRRIGHT
@to override the standard IBM action SETVERB.  This technique is used by some
@applications to enable (logical) scrolling of a displayed panel which would not
@normally allow the RIGHT command (shows message: "RIGHT" is not active).  When
@the variable SCRRIGHT is set to 'PASSTHRU' the users command ('RI','RIG','RIGH'
@or 'RIGHT') is passed through to the application and it must do another panel
@display which is a logical scroll to the right.  If the SCRRIGHT variable is
@set to null or not initialised - ISPF will ignore this command definition and
@instead use the RIGHT command from the ISPCMDS table.
