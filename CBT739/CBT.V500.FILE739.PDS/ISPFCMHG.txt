+
|The#"ISPF Commands"|tool displays commands from the active ISPF command tables.
|The displayed list shows each command's name (verb), table and description, and
|it can optionally show the command's action and truncation too.  More details
|are given in the DISPLAY FIELDS help.
|
|You can tailor the list by restricting which tables to display, by changing the
|sort order, by selecting the commands by name (matching a mask), or selecting
|the commands by description or action (matching a character string).  You can
|also select ALIAS commands, commands overriding other commands or commands that
|can be truncated.  See HELP for primary commands:*SOrt,S,F,Alias,Over,Trunc.
|
|You can dynamically update, add, delete or move commands in any active table.
|Commands can be updated either by overtyping fields on the displayed list, or
|via line commands:*E,U,I,R,D,C,M|which are explained in the LINE COMMANDS help.
|
|New command tables can be created via primary commands*NEWAppl,NEWUser,NEWSite|
|and any updated command tables can be saved permanently to disk via primary
|commands*3,SAVEuser,SAVEAppl,SAVESite|as detailed in the PRIMARY COMMANDS help.
