Hi Sam,

Here is a file of ISPFCMDS 6.0,  which has been created for the
CBTTAPE.

As I mentioned previously, ISPF version 5.5 introduced the
possibility of multiple ISPF User & Site tables, and the tool has
been updated to handle them.  However, I do not have an operating
system which allows me to test that.  I have the offsets in the
ISPF configuration module for versions 5.5 & 5.6 and I simulated
as much as I could without actual command tables.  I believe z/OS
1.7 has ISPF 5.7, hence it could possibly have different offsets
and the tool will assume that whatever tables are active are the
only ones defined.

It also displays the HELP panels for all known standard ISPF
commands (by line command 'H' on the list of commands), but I did
not have a way to find the HELP panels for any new commands after
ISPF 5.2 (z/OS 1.2).

It would be great if you could test it on a z/OS 1.6 system.
Let me know how it goes.

Regards,   Ron
