  | Exactly what commands are active, depends on your ISPF configuration and
    which table libraries are allocated.  Here are details about ISPF command
    tables, how they are used, and the configuration of ISPF for using them.

| |
# ISPF Command Tables |
# ------------------- |
    The ISPF command tables are normal, unsorted, non-keyed ISPF tables with
    one command definition in each row.  ISPF opens them in NOWRITE SHARE
    mode.

    The System table (called: "ISPCMDS") is always active, and it contains
    the basic, standard ISPF commands.  In addition, each ISPF application
    may have its own command table (called: "xxxxCMDS", where xxxx is the
    ISPF Application-Id ), concatenated ahead of the ISPCMDS table.

    You are currently using Version|&IR of ISPF.  Since ISPF Version 4.2
    you can optionally use two extra types of command tables:
     |1)ßUser table|- for individual users to maintain their own commands
     |2)ßSite table|- for site specific commands to be available to many
                      (or all) users.
    These tables are called "xxxxCMDS", where xxxx is the prefix specified
    in the ISPF configuration, (it can be from 1 to 4 bytes in length).

    ISPF Version 5.5 (with z/OS 1.5) added the option of having up to three
    User command tables and also up to three Site tables.
    For example, it might be useful to define a hierachy of Site tables with
    one of them in a library maintained by System Programmers to be used by
    all users, and others in "group libraries" maintained by groups of users
    to be shared just amongst themselves.

    The User & Site tables are not automatically available.  They can only
    be used if their names are defined in an ISPF configuration module
    (ISRCONFG or ISPCFIGU), as described below.

    Definitions in your current ISPF configuration module:ß&CONFMOD  |
    | User Table prefix . . . :ß&USERPREF+&HCTEXTU1
    |            prefix 2 . . :ß&USERPRE2+&HCTEXTU2
    |            prefix 3 . . :ß&USERPRE3+&HCTEXTU3
    | Site Table prefix . . . :ß&SITEPREF+&HCTEXTS1
    |            prefix 2 . . :ß&SITEPRE2+&HCTEXTS2
    |            prefix 3 . . :ß&SITEPRE3+&HCTEXTS3
    | Site Table Search Order :ß&ZSCTSRCH+&HCTEXTO

 |  ISPF Version 5.7 (with z/OS 1.7) added the option of specifying these
    prefix names as a mask to obtain the name from the current system name
    in one of the following formats (up to 4 characters used):
    | a)ß*    |system name from the start
    | b)ß*m   |system name starting from character position m
    | c)ß*m:n |system name from character position m to position n


# Allocating command tables |
# ------------------------- |
    TheßUser, Site|andßSystem|tables are stored as members of table
    libraries which must be allocated in ddname ISPTLIB.  The tables are
    opened when ISPF is started.  ISPF will not start without the System
    table (ISPCMDS).  But if the User or Site table names are not defined
    in the ISPF configuration module, or if they are not found, ISPF will
    work without them; they cannot be added dynamically.

    AnyßApplication|command table must be stored either in your ISPTLIB
    concatenation, or else in a library dynamically allocated (via LIBDEF)
    to ISPTLIB.  If such a table exists, it is opened when the ISPF
    application is started and closed again when it ends.  For example, SDSF
    has its own Application command table called ISFCMDS, which is open
    only while you are using SDSF, (it runs in Application-Id: ISF).

    The#"ISPF Commands"|tool shows you the tables at the top right of its
    displays.  They are shown in their search order.
      TheßACTIVE|command tables are shown in yellow.
      TheßINACTIVE|table names (shown in blue) are either:
         +a)|open tables with duplicate table names
       or+b)|configured table names but no table is open

    Note that an active command table may have ZERO rows.  For example, the
    system programmers could have created an empty User table in a protected
    library in your ISPTLIB concatenation.  Then if you create a new User
    command table (with "ISPF Commands" tool) all commands in it will be
    IMMEDIATELY active, without restarting ISPF.


# Command Table Search Order |
# -------------------------- |
    When you enter a command name, ISPF searches the command tables in the
    row order until it finds the FIRST matching command definition.

  | The Site table is either before or after the System table depending on
    the configuration parameter.  In the configuration example in the next
  | topic you will see the parameter SCTSRCH is set to 'A' so that the
    SITECMDS table is searched AFTER the ISPCMDS table.  This ensures that
    the standard ISPF commands cannot be accidentally overridden by the Site
    commands.  Thus the order ISPF uses to search for commands would be as
    follows:
      1) Application command table   (if the application has one)
      2) User command table          (if the user has one)
      3) System command table
      4) Site command table          (if a site table has been allocated)

  | If multiple User or Site tables are active their order will be the same
    as their configuration order (eg. USR1 before USR2 before USR3).


  | WARNING: make sure that the names you use for the User or Site tables are
    not the same as the Appl-Id of any ISPF application that you will use.
    There are two potential problems:

      a) If you start an ISPF application with the same name as your User
         or Site table, it uses that command table FIRST in the search
         order.  But since the table was already open, it is not read
         again from disk.  Therefore the application cannot have its own
         command table active.

      b) If you start an ISPF application with the same name as your Site
         table, it effectively puts your Site table FIRST in your command
         search order.  If you had any commands in your User table to
         OVERRIDE commands in the Site table - they will now be AFTER the
         Site table commands, so now the Site table commands can override
         your User table commands (the reverse of normal).

    If the ISPF Application-Id isßISP|, ISPF does NOT use the ISPCMDS table
    first in the search order (as an Application command table).  ISPCMDS is
    always only the System table - last or second last in the search order.


# Configuring ISPF versions 4.2 to 4.5 |
# ------------------------------------ |
    The names of the User & Site tables are defined in the ISRCONFG module,
    which is usually in SYS1.SISPLPA, but could also be in a STEPLIB or
    ISPLLIB dataset for testing.  Member ISRCNFIG of ISP.SISPSAMP is used to
    customise it, as is described in ISPF Planning & Customization manual
    topic on 'Tailoring PDF Defaults'.  By default, the names for these
    tables are blank, which means that they are not used.

    Here is a sample of a part of that member customised to add Site & User
    tables called SITECMDS and MYCMDS respectively:
  ß -----------------------------------------------------------------------
  ß USERCMDS DC  CL4'MY  '          APPLID FOR USER COMMAND TABLE      §SM2
  ß SCTSRCH  DC  CL1'A'             SITE COMMAND TABLE SEARCH ORDER    §SM2
  ß *                               SPECIFY B FOR BEFORE ISP           §SM2
  ß *                               SPECIFY A FOR AFTER ISP            §SM2
  ß SITECMDS DC  CL4'SITE'          APPLID FOR SITE COMMAND TABLE      §SM2
  ß -----------------------------------------------------------------------
  | Now this site can maintain its own special commands in the SITECMDS
    table.  Any user wanting their own commands can now create a MYCMDS
    table in one of their own datasets.  The ISPCMDS table may be changed
    in future releases of ISPF but it can always remain completely
    standard, as supplied by IBM.

    Note that the ISRCONFG module is normally customised via an SMP/E
    USERMOD and that must be re-customised for each new ISPF release,
    using the new ISRCNFIG member from the new ISPF sample library.


# Configuring ISPF versions 4.8 onwards |
# ------------------------------------- |
    ISPF version 4.8 (part of OS/390 version 2.8) introduced an ISPF
    Configuration Utility dialog.  The configuration settings are saved in
    keyword format in a configuration table file, and the Utility allows
    updating and verifying the table.  That dialog is meant to be used only
    by systems programmers, but it works as follows:

   ßMIGRATING TO ISPF 4.8|
    ---------------------
    Invoke it from anywhere within an ISPF session by commandßTSO ISPCCONF|
    (orßTSO ISPCCONF DEBUG|to see the generated assembler source code).

    From the+"ISPF Configuration Utility"|primary panel, select option:

     ß5|+"Convert Assembler Configuration Table to Keyword File"|to
          generate a new configuration table file from the assembler source
          of an old ISRCONFG configuration module.  Then that can be used
          as the basis for a new configuration module for version 4.8

     ß2|+"Edit Keyword File Configuration Table"|can then be used to check
          the output from option 5 and change any parameters as desired.

     ß4|+"Build Configuration Table Load Module"|can read the output after
          option 2 to generate a new ISPCFIGU (and possibly ISPCFIGV) load
          module(s).  The customisation module(s) are then used by all the
          users of ISPF.

    This process preserves the site's old ISPF customisation values, then
    lets the system programmer tailor the new configuration.  This should
    also make it easier for future upgrades of ISPF to a new release.

   ßCREATING A PERSONAL CONFIGURATION|
    ---------------------------------
    If you want to use your own special names for ISPF command tables you
    will need to create your own special configuration module.  IBM supply
    an ISPF Configuration Utility which you can use as follows:
    Copy the configuration table file, that was used to create the ISPCFIGU
    (and possibly ISPCFIGV) module(s) by the system programmer, to your own
    library.  If you don't have a copy of the existing configuration table
    the ISPCCONF dialog will assume all the IBM default values, and you may
    lose some other customisation.  Then start the dialog:ßTSO ISPCCONF|

      First you will see the +"ISPF Configuration Utility"|primary panel.
      Select optionß1|for the+"Create/Modify Settings"|panel.
      Select optionß5|for the+"Modify ISPDFLTS and Other DM Settings"|panel.
      Then update the fields:ß"Site Command Table Search Order"
                             ß"APPLID for User Command Table"
                             ß"APPLID for Site Command Table"|

      Return to the+"ISPF Configuration Utility"|primary panel, and select
      optionß4|for+"Build Configuration Table Load Module"|to generate new
      configuration table load module(s) in an appropriate load library,
      which could be allocated to ddname ISPLLIB.

   ßExtended ISPF Configuration Utility|
    -----------------------------------
    There is an extended version of the Configuration Utility packaged with
    the#"ISPF Commands"|tool. You can invoke via theßCONFIG|command.
    It is based on the standard utility but it has an extra option:
     ß0+"Create Keyword File from ACTIVE Configuration"|
    That can be used to create a keyword file matching your current active
    configuration module (ISPCFIGU).  Then select optionß1;5|to specify User
    User and Site table names, and select optionß4|to create a new module.
    That ensures that you don't lose any existing ISPF customisation when
    adding your own User or Site table names.

    The Extended ISPF Configuration Utility HELP panels provide more details
    of the enhancements made to the standard Configuration Utility.

    See|&OSRL ISPF Planning and Customizing manual for more details
    about the Configuration Table and Configuration Utility.
