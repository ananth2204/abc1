)AREA INFO
|   The primary command$COPY|is used to copy commands to another table.

|   Whenever you have a pending COPY message displayed like the following:
   #*** Select commands to be copied, or enter 'RES' to CANCEL the copying ***
|   the$RESet|command will cancel the copying, but not reset anything else.

    If the target table is ALREADY ACTIVE the COPY changes will be TEMPORARY,
    and if the target table is NOT ACTIVE the COPY changes will be PERMANENT.

    The commands to be copied are selected by line command$C|or$S|, from any
    of the displayed command list (except 'empty table' entries).

    When ENTER is pressed, a window is displayed to specify the target table
    name and also the following:

      +   Where in target table         Commands with same name$
            @/$ALPHABETICALLY             @/$NOREPLACE
            @ $AT START                   @ $REPLACE
            @ $AT END                     @ $DUPLICATES

|   The commands can be copied to the START or END of the target table in the
    order they are selected, or they can be copied 'alphabetically'.

    When copying 'alphabetically', it checks the target table for commands
    with same name.  If you choose REPLACE - it replaces the command; if you
    choose DUPLICATES - it adds the new command after the existing command.
    If no command is found with the same name - it attempts to insert the new
    command in the appropriate place for alphabetic order: it puts each new
    command with old commands starting with the same first letter, or else
    it inserts each new command before the first old command with a 'greater'
    first letter.

|   If the target table is ALREADY ACTIVE, the COPY will update the active
    table but NOT SAVE THE CHANGES TO DISK.  That also applies when the table
    is active in another logical split screen.

|   If the target table is NOT ACTIVE, you must confirm or specify a library
    where the table will be written, as follows.  First your ISPTLIB library
    concatenation is searched to find the table member.  If it is found - a
    window is shown for you to confirm that it is the correct library (and
    you can specify a different library if desired).  If the table was not
    found - a window requests you to supply a library name.  The target
    library must already exist.  If the table does not already exist in the
    library - another window will ask you to confirm the creation of a new
    table member.  Once the target library has been confirmed - the target
    table is briefly opened, the COPY updates are made, then the table is
    SAVED TO DISK (and closed).
