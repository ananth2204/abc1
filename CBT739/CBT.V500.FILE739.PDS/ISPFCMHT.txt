)AREA INFO
@Commands can be defined so that users don't need to type the whole command name
@to invoke them.  The~Trunc@parameter specfies the number of characters required
#"ISPF Commands"@does not show the Trunc values when it displays a command list.
@When a list has two lines per command, commands with truncation are underlined.
~
@When the#TRUNC@command is used in "ISPF Commands" tool the list is refreshed to
@display only those commands which can be truncated when the user enters them.
@Initially the list will display a second line for each command, underlining
@the~Command@field to show the MINIMUM NUMBER OF CHARACTERS REQUIRED.
~
#Examples
#--------
@Command  Table  Description / Action
§-------  ----- ----------------------------------- @Sorted by§REAL ORDER
%+#CANCER $APPL~Trunc=3, invoked by: 'CAN', 'CANC', 'CANCE' or 'CANCER'
§  ---     ALIAS ZODIAC CANCER
% #RIGHT  $ISP ~Trunc=0, invoked only by: 'RIGHT'  (hence NOT UNDERLINED)
§          SETVERB
%.#CANCEL $ISP ~Trunc=3, but partly-overridden - invoked only by: 'CANCEL'
§  ---     CANCEL
~
@If~Trunc=0@the whole command name is required, and that is how most commands
@are defined.  Those commands are not underlined, and not displayed by#TRUNC
~
@Note when~Trunc=1@the minimum number of characters is actually 2.  In such a
@case the first TWO characters would be underlined.
~
@Also, if the underlining is longer than the command name - that indicates the
@truncate value is too big, and hence that command cannot be invoked.
~
@Use line command$V@to list all valid invocations of a command.  For example:
%   ** This command is invoked by: CAN CANC CANCE CANCER
~
@The#RES@command will reset this list to ALL commands (in your selected tables).
~
@Normally the underlining shows the actual number of required characters, but if
@a command is partly-overridden that may not be valid.   An example of that is
@shown above where CANCER partly overrides CANCEL.  See HELP for OVERRIDE.
@The line command$V@shows this too.  For our example:
%   ** This command can be invoked only by entering CANCEL
%      because it is partly overridden by CANCER in table APPLCMDS
