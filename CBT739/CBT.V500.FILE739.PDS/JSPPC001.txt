$With this extension of the IBM dialog you will be able to check your own
$active ISPF configuration, customise it however you want, and not affect
$anyone else's configuration.
$
$The differences from the standard Configuration Utility are:                  $
$
$o*  Option 0$has been added.  It generates a Keyword file from the ACTIVE
$    ISPF configuration module ISPCFIGU.  First a matching assembly source
$    file is generated, then that is converted to an equivalent Keyword
$    file using the same program as Option 5.
$
$o*  Option 5$has been updated. A replacement program is used which can
$    create a valid Keyword file for whatever version of ISPF is active,
$    from OS/390 2.8 (ISPF 4.8) up to z/OS 1.7 (ISPF 5.7).
$
$o$  Field*Debug$has been added to invoke the standard debugging in the IBM
$    programs.  In the case of the new Option 0, Debug='YES' will show the
$    generated assembly source before it converts that to the Keyword file.
$
$  The standard Utility Option 4 uses skeleton ISPCSKEL to create assembly
$  source for creating an ISPCFIGU module.  The new Option 0 uses the same
$  skeleton as a map to reverse engineer your active ISPCFIGU module into
$  the correct fields in a generated matching assembly source.
