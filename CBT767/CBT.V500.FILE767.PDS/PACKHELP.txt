TPACK and TUNPACK

Recently I needed to save space in my MVS dasds and I was using
TRSMAIN utility. In most of cases I submitted some JCLs.
After a lot of submition I used my know-how in REXX language and
developed two small tools. Basically TPACK and TUNPACK, just a front-end
for this utility.

This utility uses some information included in TERSE dataset header.
Checking header data I can define what will be the DSORG and RECFM for
output untersed file.

Both tools can be used informing just one parameter and they invoke
TRSMAIN utility. (please, change the current library if different!)
For TPACK, you can use TPACK 'indataset' 'outdataset'
For TUNPACK, you can use TUNPACK 'indataset' 'outdataset'

This tool can be interesting when you use with ISPF option 3.4,
in order to don't forget to concat in SYSPROC.
