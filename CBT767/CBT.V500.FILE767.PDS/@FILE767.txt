//*     Recently I needed to save space in my MVS dasds and I       *   FILE 767
//*     was using TRSMAIN utility. In most of cases I submitted     *   FILE 767
//*     some JCLs.  After a lot of submission I used my know-how    *   FILE 767
//*     in REXX language and developed two small tools.             *   FILE 767
//*     Basically TPACK and TUNPACK, just a front-end for this      *   FILE 767
//*     utility.                                                    *   FILE 767
//*                                                                 *   FILE 767
//*     This utility uses some information included in TERSE        *   FILE 767
//*     dataset header.  Checking header data I can define what     *   FILE 767
//*     will be the DSORG and RECFM for output untersed file.       *   FILE 767
//*                                                                 *   FILE 767
//*     Both tools can be used informing just one parameter and     *   FILE 767
//*     they invoke TRSMAIN utility.  (Please, change the           *   FILE 767
//*     current library if different!)  For TPACK, you can use      *   FILE 767
//*     TPACK 'indataset' 'outdataset' For TUNPACK, you can use     *   FILE 767
//*     TUNPACK 'indataset' 'outdataset'                            *   FILE 767

//*     This tool can be interesting when you use with ISPF         *   FILE 767
