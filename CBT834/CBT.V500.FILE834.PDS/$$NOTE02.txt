Hi Sam,

I've never thought that my MIGRATE macro became so useful. We
have more than 2000 of PO/PS Data Sets and about 2000 GDGs. It
would difficult to allocate all of this manually. But as we have
DS for different regions of ENDEVOR, we use variables in our JCL.
So I have redesign my old macro and create some more to train
this tool to understand variables in DSN.

Now I have full package to prepare DSN list from existing JCL and
allocate all PO/PS and GDG. And I'd like to propose it to you.
May be it will useful for somebody else.

We use this Tool for migration from one ENDEVOR region to
another, to reallocate DS in case it allocation parameters were
changed and so on.

Also I send some of my other commands and macros.

Kind regards,
