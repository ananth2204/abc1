Hi, Sam again!

I could propose one more macro. It was written about year ago to
facilitate migration of data sets to another system. It is another
alternative way to allocate data sets.

Idea of this macro is very simple. When I run MIGRATE with REQ
option then allocation attributes are asked and stored in the
file. Now I can send this file to other system and perform
MIGRATE ALLOC, it doesn't matter with the same names or new.

In archive:

MIGRATE   - macro.

DSLIST    - list of data sets before MIGRATE REQ.

DSLIST2   - the same list after MIGRATE REQ. This list is ready
            to allocate with MIGRATE ALLOC.

With best wishes,
