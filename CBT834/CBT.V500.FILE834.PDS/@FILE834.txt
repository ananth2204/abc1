//***FILE 834 is from Alexander I. Vasilenko and contains an edit   *   FILE 834
//*           macro which helps you allocate datasets from one      *   FILE 834
//*           system to another system, and it preserves all the    *   FILE 834
//*           allocation attributes.  You supply a list of datasets *   FILE 834
//*           to the macro and edit them on the sending system.     *   FILE 834
//*           The macro then runs LISTDSI and fills in all the      *   FILE 834
//*           dataset attributes on the right side of the file.     *   FILE 834
//*           (The file has to be at least LRECL=131.)  On the      *   FILE 834
//*           sending system, you invoke the macro as:              *   FILE 834
//*                                                                 *   FILE 834
//*                MIGRATE REQ       (This puts attributes into     *   FILE 834
//*                                   the file list of datasets.)   *   FILE 834
//*                                                                 *   FILE 834
//*           On the receiving system, you edit the same (modified) *   FILE 834
//*           file that was produced by the MIGRATE REQ command     *   FILE 834
//*           on the sending system.  This time, you invoke:        *   FILE 834
//*                                                                 *   FILE 834
//*                MIGRATE ALLOC                                    *   FILE 834
//*                                                                 *   FILE 834
//*           and the macro will allocate all the datasets, with    *   FILE 834
//*           their proper attributes, on the receiving system.     *   FILE 834
//*                                                                 *   FILE 834
//*           Sample "before" and "after" dataset lists are         *   FILE 834
//*           provided in XMIT format as member SAMPLES.  After     *   FILE 834
//*                TSO RECEIVE INDS(this.pds(SAMPLES))              *   FILE 834
//*           you will get a pds with LRECL=133 that shows the      *   FILE 834
//*           "before REQ" and "after REQ" dataset lists.           *   FILE 834
