  This file describes of MIGRATE, GDGALLOC and QDS macros using.

  Macros MIGRATE and GDGALLOC perform similar functions but against
  different types of objects.

  MIGRATE macro requests and allocates PDS, PDSE and PS (including
  EXTENDED and LARGE) Data Sets.

  GDGALLOC requests and defines GDG.

  QDS macro asks Data Sets type and inserts it in the list.

  Refer to text of macro for full description.

  Lines with '*' in first position are treated as comment and do
  not processed (LOG lines are exception).
  Macros ignore lines with 'N' status also.
  If you like to process such lines, so delete status manually.

  Every macro may work with DSN wich contains variables. If you have
  such Data Sets, then you must define library with dictionary.
  This dictionary must contain members with all variables you have
  in JCL. See #TST member as example.
  You must provide separate dictionary member for every set of
  variable values.

  Also you must customise macros (see 'Interface  and variables'
  section in the macro).
  Dictionary is used only if you have variables in DSN.

  Some examples.
  MIGRATE REQ
  This macro requests allocation parameters. All DSNs can not contain
  variables.

  MIGRATE ALLOC DEL FOR PROD
  This macro will allocate Data Sets from the list using #PROD member
  from dictionary. All existing DS will be deleted.

  GDGALLOC ALLOC FOR TEST
  This macro will define GDGs using #TEST member of dictionary to
  substitute variables in DSN. If GDG exist, no action occurs.
  Appropriate status code in first position will be issued.

  You may use zz-zz line commands to applay macro to certain lines
  from the list.

  These macros write log. See LIST#UG about LOG lines.
