 Chapter : $07Intro

 XML2COB is a complementary tool of TXT2XML. It
 generates a COBOL copybook, using an XML file as
 template. Of course, you can use the generated COBOL
 copybook to convert, with TXT2XML, XML files to text
 files and vice-versa. However, like TXT2XML, it is not
 an XML parser written in Rexx, nor will support the
 entire XML specification.

 XML2COB works only with well-formed XML documents. For
 example, it will never check for missing XML closing
 tags. XML2COB generates valid COBOL copybooks, but it's
 still your responsibility to check COBOL clauses like :

 * OCCURS

 * PICTURE (symbol and length of the item).

 * SIGN

 As TXT2XML, XML2COB was tested successfully on :

 * Windows 2K,

 * Linux Mandrake 10.1,

 * MVS (OS/390 V2R10).

 It should work without problems on other platforms. To
 run XML2COB on non-mainframe platforms, you must first
 install Regina Rexx or for windows only, Reginald (see
 chapter ¢cha:Installation!). Optionally, for the GUI front-end, you may
 also install Java (see¢sec:Installation3! for more details). Should you
 succeed or encounter problems in running XML2COB on a
 non-tested platform, please send an e-mail to :

 sunuraxi@users.sourceforge.net

 XML2COB is released under the GPL license (see appendix ¢cha:License!).
