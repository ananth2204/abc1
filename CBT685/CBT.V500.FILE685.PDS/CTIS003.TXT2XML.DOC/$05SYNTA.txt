 The TXT2XML syntax is :

 TXT2XML syntax

 txt2xml

   TXT txt-file

   COB cob-file

   XML xml-file

   FORMAT format

   PREFIX prefix

   DTD dtd-file

   VERBOSE

   BROWSE

 All parameters can be typed in any case (upper, lower
 or mixed) and only in this order. But, on some case
 sensitive operating systems like Linux/Unix, file names
 must be typed with the correct case and the TXT2XML
 command must be typed in lower case. The file names may
 include space characters. TXT2XML parameters must be
 only one line, except if your operating systems allows
 continuation characters.

 5.1 <sec:Mandatory-parameters>Mandatory parameters

 5.1.1 <sub:TXT>TXT txt-file

 It's the name of the input or output (depending on the
 direction of conversion) text file. There is no default
 value for this parameter.

  Under MVS

 'txt-file' can be one of the following :

 * a sequential dataset,

 * a member of a partitioned dataset,

 * a DDname. In this case, the DDname must be preceded
   by 'DD:'.

 Before running TXT2XML, txt-file must exist, except
 when doing an XML to text conversion under ISPF.

  For all other platforms

 txt-file has to be a correct file name. The file must
 exist before running TXT2XML for a text to XML conversion.

 5.1.2 <sub:COB>COB cob-file

 It's the name of the COBOL copybook file. There is no
 default value for this parameter.

  Under MVS

 "cob-file" can be one of the following :

 * a sequential dataset,

 * a member of a partitioned dataset,

 * a DDname. In this case, the DDname must be preceded
   by 'DD:'.

 Before running TXT2XML, cob-file must always exist.

  For all other platforms

 cob-file has to be a correct file name. The file must
 always exist before running TXT2XML. Since TXT2XML does
 not handle some COBOL clauses such as REDEFINES, etc,
 it is best to "clean up" the copybook by removing all
 COBOL clauses not handled by the TXT2XML routines.

 5.1.3 <sub:XML>XML xml-file

 It's the name of the input or output (depending on the
 direction of conversion) XML file. There is no default
 value for this parameter.

  Under MVS

 "xml-file" can be one of the following :

 * a sequential dataset,

 * a member of a partitioned dataset,

 * a DDname. In this case, the DDname must be preceded
   by 'DD:'.

 Before running TXT2XML, xml-file must exist, except
 when doing a text to XML conversion under ISPF.

  For all other platforms

 xml-file has to be a correct file name. The file must
 exist before running TXT2XML for an XML to text conversion.

 5.1.4 <sub:FORMAT>FORMAT format

 The value for this parameter may only be (all
 platforms) :

 * X for text to XML conversion,

 * T to XML to text conversion.

 There is no default value for this parameter.

 5.2 <sec:Optional-parameters>Optional parameters

 5.2.1 <sub:Browse>BROWSE

 The default value for this parameter is no.

  Under MVS

 Only under ISPF and if present, will browse the
 conversion results report.

  For all other platforms

 On all other platforms, this parameter is ignored.

 5.2.2 <sub:verbose>VERBOSE

 If present, displays all the messages. The default
 value is no, all messages are not displayed.

 5.2.3 <sub:XML>DTD dtd-file

 This parameter is only valid during text to XML
 conversion. It's the name of an optional output DTD
 file or the value "INTERNAL' for a DTD included in the
 XML file. There is no default value for this parameter.
 if omitted, no DTD will be created.

  Under MVS

 "dtd-file" can be one of the following :

 * a sequential dataset,

 * a member of a partitioned dataset,

 * a DDname. In this case, the DDname must be preceded
   by 'DD:'.

 Before running TXT2XML under ISPF, dtd-file must not exist.

  For all other platforms

 dtd-file has to be a correct file name.

 5.2.4 <sub:prefix>PREFIX prefix

 If present :

 * During text to XML conversion, if prefix value is
   'COBOL-' then the COBOL item COBOL-ITEM-01 will be
   converted to <ITEM-01> .

 * During XML to text conversion, if prefix value is
   'COBOL-' then the XML element <ITEM_01> will be
   checked against the COBOL item COBOL-ITEM-01.

 There is no default value for this parameter.

  Under MVS batch (JCL)

 The dash ('-') used in COBOL item name, like
 COBOL-ITEM-01, is taken for a continuation character in
 JCL. If you use prefix within a batch job, replace all
 dashes ('-') in the COBOL item name by underscores ('_').
