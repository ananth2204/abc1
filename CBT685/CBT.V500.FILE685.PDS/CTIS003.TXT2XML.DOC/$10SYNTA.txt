 Chapter : $10Synta

 The XML2COB syntax is :

 XML2C0B syntax

 xml2cob

   COB cob-file

   XML xml-file

   PREFIX prefix

   LEVEL01

   ROUND

   VERBOSE

   BROWSE

 All parameters can be typed in any case (upper, lower
 or mixed) and only in this order. But, on some case
 sensitive operating systems like Linux/Unix, file names
 must be typed with the correct case and the XML2C0B
 command must be typed in lower case. The file names may
 include space characters. XML2C0B parameters must be
 only one line, except if your operating systems allows
 continuation characters.

 10.1 <sec:Mandatory-parameters2>Mandatory parameters

 10.1.1 <sub:COB2>COB cob-file

 It's the name of the COBOL copybook file. There is no
 default value for this parameter.

  Under MVS

 "cob-file" can be one of the following :

 * a sequential dataset,

 * a member of a partitioned dataset,

 * a DDname. In this case, the DDname must be preceded
   by 'DD:'.

 Before running XML2C0B, 'cob-file' must not exist.

  For all other platforms

 'cob-file' has to be a correct file name.

 10.1.2 <sub:XML2>XML xml-file

 It's the name of the input XML file. There is no
 default value for this parameter.

  Under MVS

 "xml-file" can be one of the following :

 * a sequential dataset,

 * a member of a partitioned dataset,

 * a DDname. In this case, the DDname must be preceded
   by 'DD:'.

 Before running XML2C0B, 'xml-file' must exist.

  For all other platforms

 'xml-file' has to be a correct file name. The file must
 exist before running XML2C0B.

 10.2 <sec:Optional-parameters2>Optional parameters

 10.2.1 <sub:prefix2>PREFIX prefix

 If prefix value is set to 'COBOL-' then the XML element
 <cobol_item_01> will generate a COBOL item called
 ITEM-01. There is no default value for this parameter.

  Under MVS batch (JCL)

 The dash ('-') used in prefix, like COBOL-, is taken
 for a continuation character in JCL. If you use prefix
 within a batch job, replace all dashes ('-") by
 underscores ('_').

 10.2.2 <sub:level01>LEVEL01

 If present, the COBOL copybook will start at level 01.
 The default value is no level 01, it starts at level 02.

 10.2.3 <sub:round>ROUND

 If present, all COBOL item length will be rounded to
 the next 5 or 0. For example :

 +-----------------------------+
 ]     COBOL item length       ]
 +-----------------------------+
 +---------------+-------------+
 ] Before round  ] After round ]
 +---------------+-------------+
 ]      8        ]     10      ]
 +---------------+-------------+
 ]      48       ]     50      ]
 +---------------+-------------+
 ]     113       ]     125     ]
 +---------------+-------------+
 ]     205       ]     250     ]
 +---------------+-------------+
 ]     517       ]     600     ]
 +---------------+-------------+


 The default value is no round, item length is not rounded.

 10.2.4 <sub:Browse2>BROWSE

 The default value for this parameter is no.

  Under MVS

 Only under ISPF and if present, will browse the
 generation results report.

  For all other platforms

 On all other platforms, this parameter is ignored.

 10.2.5 <sub:verbose2>VERBOSE

 If present, displays all the messages. The default
 value is no, all messages are not displayed.
