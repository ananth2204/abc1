 Chapter : $01Intro

 COBOL, a forty years old computer language, and XML a
 new revolutionary format, seems to as near as the earth
 and the moon. However, if you look any further, you
 will notice some common concepts :

 The need to exchange data in XML between servers is
 continuously increasing and, in each mainframe around
 the world, there are plenty of COBOL copybooks and text
 files. So, was born the idea of TXT2XML : a bridge
 between the common concepts of COBOL and XML. It's not
 a GUIHowever, starting with version 1.25, a GUI front-end
 has been developed. See chapter ¢cha:The-Graphical-User! for more details.
  tool, it's a Rexx script (for more info on Rexx see
 appendix ¢cha:Internet-resources!) running in a DOS command interface for the
 Windows users, a shell for the Unix users, ISPF or JCL
 for the mainframe users.

 TXT2XML is not an XML parser written in Rexx, nor will
 support the entire XML specification. Some COBOL
 clauses are also not supported (like REDEFINES,
 DEPENDING, ... ). TXT2XML works in both directions,
 i.e. it can convert XML files to text files and
 vice-versa. The COBOL copybook is always mandatory to
 perform the conversion, because :

 * During XML to text conversion, XML element names are
   checked against the COBOL item names. For example, if
   there is an XML element like <cobol_item_01>, there
   must be an item like COBOL-ITEM-01 in the COBOL copybook.

 * During text to XML conversion, the COBOL copybook
   item names are used to build the XML elements.

 * During XML to text conversion, if a COBOL item is
   numeric, the XML content is checked to see if it's
   also numeric. Otherwise conversion will fail.

 * ...

 TXT2XML was therefore developed primarily to convert
 data files typically used on a mainframe. TXT2XML works
 only with well-formed XML documents and valid COBOL
 copybooks. TXT2XML will never check for COBOL syntax
 errors or missing XML closing tags. TXT2XML generates
 100 % compatible and well-formed XML files, but it's
 still your responsibility to validate them against a
 DTD with an XML parser.

 TXT2XML was originally written on an IBM mainframe
 running OS/390 V2R10. But, starting with version 1.15,
 TXT2XML should also run on the following platforms :

 * Linux,

 * FreeBSD,

 * Solaris,

 * AIX,

 * HP-UX,

 * OS/2,

 * eCS,

 * DOS,

 * Win9x/Me/NT/2k/XP,

 * Amiga,

 * AROS,

 * QNX4.x,

 * QNX6.x,

 * BeOS,

 * MacOS X,

 * EPOC32,

 * AtheOS,

 * OpenVMS,

 * SkyOS,

 * OpenEdition.

 As it's impossible to run all those OS, TXT2XML was
 tested successfully on :

 * Windows 2K,

 * Linux Mandrake 10.0,

 * MVS (OS/390 V2R10).

 It should work without problems on the other platformswith the exception of binary and packed data..
 To run TXT2XML on non-mainframe platforms, you must
 first install Regina Rexx or for windows only, Reginald
 (see chapter ¢cha:Installation!). Should you succeed or encounter
 problems in running TXT2XML on a non-tested platform,
