//*     1) Introduction                                             *   FILE 685
//*     ---------------                                             *   FILE 685
//*                                                                 *   FILE 685
//*        In 2002, after a XML internet course, I was              *   FILE 685
//*        thoughful. Strange, I thought : XML and COBOL, there     *   FILE 685
//*        are concepts in common. Hierarchy of data, identation    *   FILE 685
//*        for a better visualization, complex entities (in         *   FILE 685
//*        COBOL : group items), ... Wouldn't it be interesting     *   FILE 685
//*        if it was possible to convert data from a flat file      *   FILE 685
//*        to XML one using a COBOL copybook ?                      *   FILE 685
//*                                                                 *   FILE 685
//*        Nobody will stop XML (r)evolution and in my              *   FILE 685
//*        administration, there are plenty of COBOL copybooks      *   FILE 685
//*        and ... flat files So why not ? And in September         *   FILE 685
//*        2002, the first release of TXT2XML was released.         *   FILE 685
//*                                                                 *   FILE 685
//*        "Interesting" say my collegues. But after the            *   FILE 685
//*        migration of all of our programs to the EURO             *   FILE 685
//*        currency, nobody was ready to investigate this           *   FILE 685
//*        technology. There were too much projects that have       *   FILE 685
//*        been delayed ...                                         *   FILE 685
//*                                                                 *   FILE 685
//*        So, TXT2XML was frozen until 2004 when somebody          *   FILE 685
//*        asked me to make conversion in both senses (to and       *   FILE 685
//*        from XML).                                               *   FILE 685
