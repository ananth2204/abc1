                   ------------ ------------

Installation of this package is very simple.  There are 6 REXX execs
and the rest of the members are ISPF panels.  Copy the REXX execs into
a pds in the SYSPROC or ISPEXEC concatenation for your TSO session,
and copy the panel members into a pds in the ISPPLIB concatenation,
as follows:

REXXES:

EFQDDN EFQPT EFQTAB EFQVAR EFQVAR1 THSPROFS


PANELS:

THSAPPLG THSGVARS THSQTABC THSQTABD THSQTABT THSQTAB1
THSQTAB2 THSQTAB3 THSQTAB4 THSVARSM VI2


After installation, just invoke the exec:  THSPROFS
and you are on your way.
