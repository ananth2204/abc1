Hi Sam

PCRE2 for z/OS release 10.33 is ready.

Here is the readme for release 10.33
------------------------------------
There is a change in the way the PCRE2 library is distributed
This change is not reflected in the doc.  The doc should be modified
for next release.  You may find the doc in the JCLLIB in EBCDIC and
it is also the only ASCII file that is provided with the current
distro.

I came to recognize that most users would not actually build the
package from the ASCII files but rather would use the provided EBCDIC
XMI files.  I will not provide the ASCII load files with the distro
any more, unless specifically asked to.  Rather, I intend to expand
the use of my GIT site and provide a version of the ASCII files there.

I hope to be ready with the GIT site and publish it for the next
release.

If you really need the ASCII files, please contact me via emsil:
