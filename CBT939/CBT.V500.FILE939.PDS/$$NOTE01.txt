As per Sam's request, I'll try to clarify the code page issue a
bit farther.  There are two, related but not totally connected
issues.

1. IBM set their C compiler to work with IBM1047, however all the
   machines that I have access to seem to be set to IBM1140 which
   is the old '037' code page.  I had to do some acrobatics and
   replace the caret sign with the IBM logical not (which is the
   caret in IBM1047) for the thing to work.

2. Other languages' EBCDIC code pages issue.

2.1. Originally, I thought to set some switch in the config.h
   header file, in order to allow some logic for various
   languages and code pages.  This was proven to be unnecessary,
   but I did not remove the switches from the header in case I
   will need them sometime in the future.  You should ignore
   those switches.

2.2. OTH, since the only machines that I have access to are in
   the USA, I could not compile or test other languages.  Therefore,
   the supplied LOADLIB is for USA English.  If you want to work
   with other languages like Russian, Hebrew or Turkish, you must
   compile your own version of the LOADLIB.

The good news is that if you run the COMPCRE2 member in the
JCLLIB and all is compiled and bound with RC=4 or less, then you
are good.  The first step builds the correct character table for
your machine and the second step compiles it.

The bad news is that if your caret is in the other place, you
will have to transform it all over the place, especially in the
SRCE and TESTLIB libraries.

Note that there is one line in the source code, in the PCRZOSCS
header file that is marked with '<tag>'.  The caret sign in that
line must stay as caret in the source code.
