Hi Sam

Perl Compatible Regular Expressions library PCRE2, now release 10.21.

PCRE2 is the new version of PCRE.  The relations between the old
PCRE and the new PCRE2 are analogous to the relations between
z/OS 1.n and z/OS 2.n and therefore it requires a new CBT file,
File 939.

This is a full implementation of PCRE2 release 10.21 in native
classic z/OS.  The included XMI files are binary images of all
required libraries.  There is a document member and a license
member in the JCLLIB library.  You would notice that this open
source software is distributed under the BSD license and thus it
is business and corporate friendly.

With the advent of PCRE2, the old PCRE (File 882) is superseded.
While there would be some bug fixes, any new development would be
done in PCRE2.  I believe that there are not too many
installations that use the old PCRE and they are encouraged to
move to PCRE2.
