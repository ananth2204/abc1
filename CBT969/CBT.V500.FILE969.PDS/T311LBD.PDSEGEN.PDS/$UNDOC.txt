There are some undocumented primary and line commands:

Primary Commands:

ACHmed - used to allow the display in the member list of dummy members
       - the absoluate generation for these dummy members is the high
         water mark of absolute generations for that member and where
         the generation count will resume if/when the member is
         recreated.
       - Entering Achmed ? will bring up a short tutorial about Achmed
OUTput - will copy the active PDSEGEN table list to a dataset and
         place the user in Browse on it. The generated dataset will
         *not* be deleted upon exit and will be reused (that is it
         will be deleted if it exists and then recreated).

Line Commands:

W      - Allows editing generations directly as PDSEGEN
         automatically converts an Edit to View
