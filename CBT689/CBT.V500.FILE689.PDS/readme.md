The macros are mostly based upon PL/S mappings distributed on the
optional materials tapes for MVS, and on information in the old
Catalog Management PLM.  To the best of my knowledge, there is no
copyright attached to these macros, and they may be considered to
be public domain.

While they are believed to be correct, the author can not be
responsible for any damages resulting from their use.

Note from Sam Golob:

  The member called $$MACROS contains the macros as expanded in
  Peter's written paper.  But the machine-readable assemblable
  macros themselves have been included under their own names, as
  separate members in this file.  See the list of names, above.
