//***FILE 689 is from Peter Sawyer and contains his (now famous)    *   FILE 689
//*           paper from SHARE in 1989, which documents how SVC 26  *   FILE 689
//*           is used in programming.  SVC 26, which generally      *   FILE 689
//*           includes catalog lookups, LOCATE, SUPERLOCATE, and    *   FILE 689
//*           other things, is VERY SPARSELY documented by IBM.     *   FILE 689
//*           It is very difficult to find real help in programming *   FILE 689
//*           when you want to write a user program which calls     *   FILE 689
//*           SVC 26 directly.  So therefore Peter Sawyer's paper   *   FILE 689
//*           on this subject is very much needed.                  *   FILE 689
//*                                                                 *   FILE 689
//*           Peter has retrieved this document, and has very       *   FILE 689
//*           kindly donated it to the CBT Tape, so now, it can     *   FILE 689
//*           be very accessible to everybody.                      *   FILE 689
//*                                                                 *   FILE 689

//*           Please note that the coding examples of the catalog   *   FILE 689
//*           macros have been included in a member of this pds     *   FILE 689
//*           called PRINT, which is in TSO XMIT format.  When      *   FILE 689
//*           you do a RECEIVE of the PRINT member, you will get    *   FILE 689
//*           an FB-133 sequential dataset which has the catalog    *   FILE 689
//*           macros expanded, and the field displacements shown.   *   FILE 689
//*           Alternatively, you can assemble the pds member        *   FILE 689
//*           called CATMAP, using the macro sources which appear   *   FILE 689
//*           in this file's pds.                                   *   FILE 689
//*                                                                 *   FILE 689
//*           The following is an example execution of the TSO      *   FILE 689
//*           RECEIVE command for the PRINT member:                 *   FILE 689
//*                                                                 *   FILE 689
//*             RECEIVE INDS(xxxx.FILE689.PDS(PRINT))               *   FILE 689
//*                                                                 *   FILE 689
//*           When you execute this, you'll get the FB-133          *   FILE 689
//*           sequential file which shows the field displacements   *   FILE 689
//*           in the catalog macros.                                *   FILE 689
//*                                                                 *   FILE 689
