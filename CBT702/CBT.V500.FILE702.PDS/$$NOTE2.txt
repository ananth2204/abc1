Sam,
  Here are the latest files for the Mellon Mods.  They are currently
running in our shop under z/OS 1.6, with no reported problems.


  In addition to the files we have been sending, I am including four new
members for documentation.  I realize the documentation of the past has
left a lot to be desired, and hope this will be of help to those who are
installing or evaluating these mods for the first time.

  The new members are:

     DOCOVW - a plain text overview of the function and purpose.
     DOCUSR - a plain text set of user documentation.
     DOCINS - a plain text set of installation documentation.
     $$NOTE2 - this member.

  I have also renamed the old DOC member to DOCOLD, most of the old
documentation is just no longer pertinent.

Let me know if you have any questions.

- Thanks,
       Steve M.
