Sam,

  I have downloaded and reviewed the latest updates to File 702.
Currently, as you know, there are two versions of the Mellon Mods
on File 702.  The previous version 1.4 - PRE-ACTIVATE version,
which was listed as such because at that time we had no way to
test on a MAS that had been "Activated".  The newest version that
we sent to you for 1.6 is POST-ACTIVATE tested.  Actually, either
the 1.4 or the 1.6 version will run before, or after, the MAS has
been activated.

  The difference between the two versions on File 702 is primaily
documentation.

 The sample SMP/E jobstreams have been updated with additional
comments so that you know what must be changed as you go through
the install process.

 The New documentation members DOCOVW - documentation overview,
DOCINS - install documentation, and DOCUSR - user documentation
have been added to provide good documentation.  The original
documentation has been kept in member DOCOLD for anyone that
needs the original - old documentation.

 The code in member LSES512, which is used for exit 49, was
changed to fix a bug.  The job selection routine would select a
job with a /*WITH jobname statement for execution, if there was a
match for the jobname on the input queue, not on the execution
queue.  After the fix the /*WITH jobname statement causes job
selection to proceed as documented, and will only allow the job
to execute if the jobname referenced in the /*WITH statement is
currently IN EXECUTION, not just somewhere on the queue.

  We did not need to make any conversion changes to go from 1.4
to 1.6, or from pre-activate, to post-activate mode.  The mods
have now been run in our shop in all of the following
combinations without problems - other than the one bug that was
documented above and fixed in the 1.6 version of the mods.

 1.4 Pre-activate
 1.4 Post-activate
 1.6 Pre-activate
 1.6 Post-activate

  Because the two levels are equivelent, except for the one bug
fix, and the documentation, I would strongly recommend that only
the newer 1.6 version of the mods be used in any JES2
installation running 1.2 or later.  Prior to 1.2 an older version
of the mods will be needed to accommodate for JES2 macros
changes.

  This level of forward and backward compatibility was able to be
accomplished by the rewrite that we went through a few years ago
when the massive source changes to JES2 were all converted to
standard JES2 exits.


I hope this helps,
