This note is from Frank Lawrence of Sun Trust, who is the current
keeper of the Mellon JES2 Mods, or a number of them, such as they
are nowadays.

Sam,

Our complete JES2 mods are attached in a TSO XMIT file.  That is
probably more than other folks want, but it will serve to remove
any ambiguities if they wonder why something is the way it is.  I
should also note that these are pre-z/OS 1.4 newest "activate"
for things like extended job number range.  We have some OEM
products that can't handle the extended job numbers in their
current release, so we have had to delay implementing those
features in z/OS 1.4.  We have tested them with these mods, but
that isn't the same as having them in production.

Let me know if you have any questions.

- Thanks,
       Frank
