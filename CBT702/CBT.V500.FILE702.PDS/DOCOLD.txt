    THE FOLLOWING IS A BRIEF EXPLANATION OF THE MELLON BANK MODS
MADE TO JES2.  IT IS INTENDED FOR THOSE WHO ARE UNFAMILIAR WITH
PREVIOUS VERSIONS OF HASP OR JES2 SHARED SPOOL SUPPORT AND IS
BEING PROVIDED IN LIEU OF THE FORMAL DOCUMENT ORIGINALLY
DISTRIBUTED WITH THE HASP V4 MELLON MODIFICATIONS.  IF THE WRITE-UP
LEAVES YOU WITH SOME UNANSWERED QUESTIONS, YOU MAY GIVE US A CALL.

RESOURCE ROUTING CONTROL CARDS

     PROVIDES A FACILITY BY WHICH JOBS CAN BE ROUTED TO SPECIFIC
CPUS DEPENDING ON THE AVAILABILITY OF A PARTICULAR RESOURCE NAME
ASSIGNED TO A CPU.  RESOURCE NAMES ARE USER DEFINED (SYSTEMS PROGRAMMER)
AND SPECIFIED IN THE JES2 MACRO  $RESTABL.  ONCE DEFINED, THESE
RESOURCE NAMES ATTACHED TO A CPU REMAIN IN EFFECT UNTIL THEY ARE
DETACHED VIA THE $QD COMMAND, OR A COLD START IS DONE AND ALL
RESOURCES ARE THEN UNASSIGNED.

     RESOURCES SPECIFIED IN THE $RESTABL MACRO CAN DEFINE PHYSICAL
I/O GEAR WHICH MAY BE ATTACHED TO ONLY ONE CPU AT A TIME, OR
POSSIBLY A SOFTWARE NAME WHICH MAY ONLY PERTAIN TO ONE PARTICULAR CPU.


SPECIFICATION ... IN $RESTABL MACRO


ASSIGNMENT....... $QA,resource       attached a resource name from
                                     the table to this system.


                  $QD,resource       remove a resource name from this
                                     system if no jobs executing using
                                     specified resource.

                  $QD,resource,FORCE remove resource name from this
                                     system even if jobs executing are
                                     using the resource name.

USE............... /*ROUTE XEQ resource     ...  FOLLOWING JOBCARD

                   JOB WILL AUTOMATICALLY BE SCHEDULED TO THE CPU(S)
                   BEARING THIS RESOURCE NAME IN ITS QSE


EXAMPLE:    SYSTEM #       RESOURCES ATTACHED
            ________       __________________

               1           DUALD,IMS

               2           3525

               3           IMS,TSO,NOINQ


   //BSPROUT JOB (,,7551,429),'TEST RESOURCE',MSGLEVEL=(1,1),CLASS=A
   /*ROUTE XEQ IMS
   //S1 EXEC PGM=IEFBR14


THIS JOB WILL BE SCHEDULED TO EITHER SYSTEM #1 OR SYSTEM #3


     THE $DC COMMAND IS USED TO DISPLAY THOSE JOBS WHICH HAVE USED
THE /*ROUTE XEQ RESOURCE CONTROL CARD AND NO CPUS HAVE THAT RESOURCE
NAME ATTACHED....  FOR EXAMPLE, USING THE ABOVE LIST, IF A JOB WERE
SUBMITTED WITH A   /*ROUTE XEQ SCANNER   CONTROL CARD, THE JOB WOULD
NEVER EXECUTE NO MATTER HOW MANY INITIATORS WERE AVAILABLE UNTIL
A SYSTEM IN THE COMPLEX WOULD ISSUE A $QA,SCANNER.  THIS WOULD
BE DETECTABLE BY ISSUING A $DC COMMAND WHICH WOULD DISPLAY THOSE
JOBS WAITING FOR RESOURCE NAMES.


     THE $DR COMMAND WILL LIST THE RESOURCE ATTACHED TO EACH CPU.

 EXAMPLE

     $DR          NO OPERANDS  DEFAULTS THIS CPU

     $DR,&SID     LIST SPECIFIC CPU RESOURCES.


     OTHER /*ROUTE CONTROL CARD FORMATS.........

      /*ROUTE XEQ HERE
          JOB WILL BE SCHEDULED FOR EXECUTION ON THE CPU WHICH
          READ THE JCL.  (CONTROLLING THE CARD READER)



---------------------------------------------------------------


           .............. /*CNTL CARDS ..............


     THIS FEATURE PROVIDES THE ABILITY TO SINGLE-THREAD JOBS
THROUGH EXECUTION WHICH NEED A DEVICE OF WHICH THERE IS ONLY ONE
AND MUST BE USED SERIALLY.  SOME EXAMPLES WOULD BE THE 3525,
DUALD DENSITY DRIVE AND THE OCR SCANNER.


     BY USING THE /*CNTL CARD, YOU CAN DEFINE A RESOURCE NAME THAT
YOU NEED EXCLUSIVE CONTROL OF.  IF ANY OTHER JOBS COME INTO THE SYSTEM
WITH THE SAME CONTROL NAME, THEY WILL NOT EXECUTE SIMULTANEOUSLY ON
THE SAME OR OTHER CPUS IN THE COMPLEX.  THIS PROVIDES BETTER CONTROL
OVER THE RESOURCES WE HAVE THAT MUST BE USED SERIALLY.  THIS DOES NOT
AFFECT JOBS RUNNING WITHOUT THE /*CNTL CARD OR RUNNING IN A SYSTEM
WITHOUT SHARED SPOOL.


   THE FORMAT FOR RESOURCE CONTROL IS :

         /*CNTL name,EXC     OR
         /*CNTL name,SHR    (DEFAULT SHR)


     USERS MAY ALSO PROTECT DATASETS FROM BEING BEING UPDATED BY
DIFFERENT JOBS ON THE SAME OR DIFFERENT CPUS BY USING THE /*CNTL CARD.
EACH /*CNTL CARD MAY HAVE A 1 TO 8 CHARACTER CONTROL NAME AND AN EXC
OR SHR SPECIFICATION.

     JOBS WITH THE SAME CNTL NAME WILL NOT EXECUTE SIMUTANEOUSLY
IF ONE OF THE JOBS HAS AN EXC CONTROL SPECIFICATION. JOBS WITH SHR
MAY EXECUTE SIMUTANEOUSLY ON ANY CPU.


EXAMPLES:

    //JOB1 JOB
    /*CNTL MASTER,EXC


    //JOB2 JOB
    /*CNTL MASTER,SHR


  IN THE ABOVE EXAMPLE, WHICHEVER JOB BEGAN EXECUTION FIRST, WOULD
LOCKOUT THE OTHER JOB FROM BEGINNING UNTIL IT HAS COMPLETED.



    //JOB1 JOB
    /*CNTL MASTER,SHR


    //JOB2 JOB
    /*CNTL MASTER


    //JOB3 JOB
    /*CNTL MASTER,SHR


  IN THE ABOVE EXAMPLE, ALL 3 JOBS COULD RUN SIMULTANEOUSLY AS THEY
ALL SPECIFY THE SHR OPTION.

/*BEFORE, /*AFTER, /*WITH dependent job control cards


FORMAT :      /*BEFORE jobname
              /*AFTER  jobname
              /*WITH   jobname


     Provides a means to schedule jobs before, after, or with another
     JOB/TSU/STC in the execution queue.  These cards must follow the
     JOB card.

     IF THE BEFORE OR AFTER JOBNAME IS NOT IN THE JOBQ, THERE IS
     NO ACTION TAKEN ON PREVENTING THE JOB FROM BEGINNING.

     IF THE WITH jobname IS NOT IN THE JOBQ, THE JOB WILL
     WAIT FOR THE JOB/TSU/STC TO BEGIN EXECUTION.

EXAMPLE #1:


    /*PRIORITY     13
    //BSPTEST  JOB (,,7551,429),KALISH,MSGLEVEL=(1,1),CLASS=A
    /*AFTER BSPFIRST
    //S1 EXEC PGM=IEFBR14
    /*
    /*PRIORITY     2
    //BSPFIRST JOB (,,7551,429),KALISH,MSGLEVEL=(1,1),CLASS=A
    /*CNTL DUALD,EXC
    //SA EXEC PGM=IEFBR14
    /*


  IN THE ABOVE EXAMPLE, JOB BSPTEST WOULD NOT EXECUTE UNTIL JOB
BSPFIRST HAS FINISHED EXECUTION, EVEN THOUGH BSPTEST HAS A HIGHER
PRIORITY.




EXAMPLE #2:


    /*PRIORITY     10
    //cicst900 JOB (,,7551,429),KALISH,MSGLEVEL=(1,1),CLASS=A
    /*WITH CICSTEST
    //S1 EXEC PGM=IEFBR14
    /*


  In the above example, job CICST900 would not execute until JOB/TSU/STC
CICSTEST began executiion.  At that time, CICST900 would be eligible
for selection by an initiator in the same system as CICSTEST.

*  MELLON BANK SHARED SPOOL FOR SP 4.2.0 JES2 FMID(HJE4420)
*
*  THESE CHANGES WILL REQUIRE A COLD-START SINCE THEY MODIFY JES2
*  CONTROL BLOCKS (IE. QSE, JQE)...
*
*  SINCE SP 1.3.3 JES2 THE VAST MAJORITY OF THE MELLON MOD CODE
*  HAS BEEN REMOVED FROM INSTREAM HASPSRC UPDATES AND HAS BEEN
*  PLACED INTO JES2 EXIT CODE THAT IS TAKEN BY THE JES2 MAIN
*  TASK.
*
*
*     ADDITIONALLY, DEPENDENT JOB CONTROL HOLD/OWNERSHIP IS DISPLAYED.
*
*  $  THE FOLLOWING MODULES, MACROS, AND CONTROL BLOCK ARE CHANGED.
*
*      $JQE, $QSE, $RDRWORK, $HCT, HASPCOMM
*
*
*  $    THE FOLLOWING STATEMENTS NEED TO BE ADDED TO THE JES2 PARAMETER
*       LIBRARY TO ESTABLISH THE NECESSARY JES2 EXIT ENVIRONMENT AT

              2.0  Mellon Bank Supported JECL Statements
              ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

 The /*AFTER statement




   #~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~!
   |                                                                 |
   |  /*AFTER jobname                                                |
   |                                                                 |
   %~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~¢


  Use the /*AFTER statement to insure that a given job executes after
  another job that is currently in the spool complex awaiting execution
  or executing.

  The value, jobname, is any one to eight byte valid JES2 job name.

  Only one /*AFTER card is supported per job.  If more that one
  /*AFTER card is present in a job stream, only the last one has
  any meaning.

  The use of a /*AFTER card reduces by one the maximum allowable number
  of /*CNTL cards available for use by a given job.
1






 The /*BEFORE statement




   #~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~!
   |                                                                 |
   |  /*BEFORE jobname                                               |
   |                                                                 |
   %~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~¢


  Use the /*BEFORE statement to insure that a given job executes before
  another job that is currently in the spool complex awaiting execution.

  The value, jobname, is any one to eight byte valid JES2 job name.

  Only one /*BEFORE card is supported per job.  If more that one
  /*BEFORE card is present in a job stream, only the last one has
  any meaning.

  The use of a /*BEFORE card reduces by one the maximum allowable
  number of /*CNTL cards available for use by a given job.
1






 The /*WITH statement




   #~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~!
   |                                                                 |
   |  /*WITH jobname                                                 |
   |                                                                 |
   %~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~¢


  Use the /*WITH statement to insure that a given job executes in the
  same complex member as the specified jobname.  If the named job is
  not currently active when the job using the /*WITH card enters
  the job queue, the job with the /*WITH card will wait for the named
  job to become active.

  The value, jobname, is any one to eight byte valid JES2 job name.

  Only one /*WITH card is supported per job.  If more that one
  /*WITH card is present in a job stream, only the last one has
  any meaning.

  The use of a /*WITH card reduces by one the maximum allowable
  number of /*CNTL cards available for use by a given job.

 The /*CNTL statement




   #~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~!
   |                                                                 |
   |                #    !                                           |
   |  /*CNTL anyname|,EXC|                                           |
   |                |,SHR|                                           |
   |                %    ¢                                           |
   |                                                                 |
   %~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~¢


  Use the /*CNTL statement to declare a user defined abstract resource
  name that will be used by the given job as well as the disposition
  of the named resource.

  The value, anyname, is any one to eight byte name defined by the
  user to represent an abstract resource.

  Up to six /*CNTL cards are supported per job stream; however, the
  use of /*AFTER /*BEFORE and /*WITH cards reduces this number.

  EXC denotes that the job requests exclusive control over the named
  abstract resource.  A job specifying this option will not begin
  execution if any other job currently executing in the MAS spool
  complex has requested the same abstract resource name either shared
  (SHR) or exclusively (EXC).

  SHR denotes that the job requests shared control over the named
  abstract resource.  A job specifying this option will not begin
  execution if any other job currently executing in the MAS spool
  complex has requested the same abstract resource name exclusively
  (EXC).  However, multiple jobs are permitted to execute if they all
  request shared control over the same abstract resource name.

  If neither EXC nor SHR are specified, the requested control over the
  named abstract resource is assumed to be shared (SHR).

 The /*ROUTE statement




   #~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~!
   |                                                                 |
   |  /*ROUTE XEQ resource                                           |
   |                                                                 |
   %~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~¢


  Use the /*ROUTE statement to insure that a given job executes in
  a MAS member that contains the named JES2 abstract resource.

  The value, resource, is any one of the JES2 systems programmer
  defined abstract resource names.  Use the TSO HELP RESOURCE command
  to determine all of the available resource names.

  As many /*ROUTE cards as necessary may be present in the job stream.

  The /*ROUTE cards may be in any order in relation to all other
  JCL or JECL cards in the job stream.

  The value, HERE, may be used in place of a resource name.  It denotes
  that the job must execute on the MAS member upon which the job was
  entered.
