Add ability to display/update addtional DSCB formats
As of Feb, 2010, the only type supported is format 1

Add a "sanity" check if the user wants.
Verify RECFM, LRECL, BLKSIZE, other fields are consistent.
Warn the user if things are not consistent and allow them to
confirm or abort.

Add logic for extended volumes.
