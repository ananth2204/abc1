From the CBT you should have
    DOC
    ISPPLIB
    JCL
    MACLIB

VTOCZAP calls RACF to restrict use.
The level of access is always READ.
As is the CLASS name is VZAP
          Resource names   READVTOC     To use VZAP at all
                           UPDTVTOC     To update any VTOC DSCBs
                           DISPFMT1     To view any FMT1 information
                           UPDTFMT1     to update any FMT1 DSCBs
Add the RACF resources and give the users READ access.
As is, VZAP uses LOG=NONE on the RACF checks.  If you want to
log the use of VZAP, change the LOG= parameter on the RACROUTE
macro in the VZAPAUTH member of the SOURCE library.


.  VTOCZAP will dynamically APF authorize itself only when it needs
   the authorization.  If you have an SVC or other means of
   dynamic APF authorization, edit member VZAPAPF in the SOURCE.



.  Edit the JOBs in the JCL library
   . add JOB cards
   . Update the data set names

.  Run the ALLOC member to allocate the OBJECT and LOADLIBs

.  Run the ASM member to assemble and link the VTOCZAP utility

.  If you have TSOPLUS,
     Copy the VZAP and VZAP2 members of the DOC library to a
     CLIST or REXX library available to your TSO address space
   If not,
     Copy the VZAP and VZAPX (as VZAP2) members of the DOC library to a
     CLIST or REXX library available to your TSO address space
     You will need to make the LOADLIB available to your TSO users
     via STEPLIB, LINKLST, etc

.  Edit VZAP and VZAP2 REXX exec's
   Change the data set names you used
