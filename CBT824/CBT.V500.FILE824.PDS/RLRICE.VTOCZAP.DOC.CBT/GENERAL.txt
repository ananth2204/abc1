VTOCZAP is intended to let you fix botched DSCBs in a VTOC.

It does not enforce any rules.

It does not ENQ or serialize the VTOC, DSCB, device, anything

For example for a file with fixed blocked records, the block size
should be a multiple of the record length.  Variable length records
should have block size at least four bytes larger than the record
size.  VTOCZAP will let you change the record size, block size,
record format.. without checking.

Make sure you know what you are doing.  VTOCZAP can get you into
trouble just as fast as (probably faster than) it can fix problems.


Why would you want to use VTOCZAP?  If a DSN or other info in a
DSCB gets clobbered (who knows how), you can fix it.  Ever have
a data set that you need to delete or rename, but can't get it
because another data set with the same name is allocated on another
volume?  VTOCZAP can change the DSN without the ENQ.  You can
rename the data set.  Once it has been renamed, you can delete it.




Before using VTOCZAP to change a DSN, turn the VTOC index off.

   //INDEXOFF EXEC PGM=ICKDSF
   //INDEXOFF DD UNIT=SYSALLDA,VOL=SER=vvvvvv,DISP=OLD
   //SYSPRINT DD SYSOUT=*
   //SYSIN    DD *
    BUILDIX DDNAME(INDEXOFF) OSVTOC
   /*

Change the DSN.
Re-create the index.
   //INDEXON  EXEC PGM=ICKDSF
   //INDEXON  DD UNIT=SYSALLDA,VOL=SER=vvvvvv,DISP=OLD
   //SYSPRINT DD SYSOUT=*
   //SYSIN    DD *
    BUILDIX DDNAME(INDEXON) IXVTOC
   /*
