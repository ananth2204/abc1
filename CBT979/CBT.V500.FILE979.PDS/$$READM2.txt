General Philosophy Regarding This File.  (An advanced look.)

Why is there a load library, and source for NODSI (which is an
unrelated program), and a listing?

Why is there an emphasis on the "type over zap" capability here?

It seems to me that the purpose of this whole thing is to train
z/OS people in using this tool.  The Herc stuff is just incidental,
providing a vehicle to create a "practice environment".  I also
understand that ZZSA is not the "environment of choice" for dealing
z/OS.  It is only a fixing tool, when nothing else is available.
But it has capabilities that are considerable, including a "type
over" zap, which is kind of rare, as tools go.  Question is, to
find the right place to zap and get there accurately.  That skill
is what I'm trying to help with.

That piece of it is not for "the casual user".  So you need a lot
of practice, if you want to take the tool that far.  I have even
installed a disassembly listing of NODSI, on the CYL005 pack,
so they can try and learn to navigate to the correct place to zap.

The usual use for the zap (with ZZSA) is clipping a pack by
changing its id record (in record 3, track 0).  That record is
easy to get to (0000000003).  But load module locations are very
hard to find with ZZSA, and I don't want to exclude the
adventurous user who may want to learn to do that too.
