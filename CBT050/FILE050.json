Sometimes they update their\nthings very often, not in coincidence with when the CBT Tape gets\nupdated.  And also, sometimes the stuff can't be easily put into\nthe CBT Tape partitioned dataset format, such as a free UNIX based\nC compiler I recently discovered.  So, we'll point you to them,\nand you can grab 'em for youselves, if you want them.\n\n      Anyone can feel free to inform me about a useful MVS site.\nI'll be the proprietor of this file, but if you have any useful\nupdates, just send them to me via email and I'll merge them in.\nIf you can put the info into my (standard?) format, then please do\nso.

Most of these have been\n  verified to exist, but not all.  Web sites change......\n\nThe greatest site for free MVS software on the web is of course the\nhome page for the CBT Tape;\n http://www.cbttape.org/\n\nIf you are lucky enough to work for a company that subscribes the\none of the XEPHON Update periodicals you will be able to download\nrecent programs.  They have kindly made the archives accessible to\neveryone, there is a lot of older code there which is still useful.\n http://www.xephon.com/down1.html\n\nThere are a lot of IBM sites with downloads available. These are\nbeing updated frequently, so I will not list them. Start from one of\nthe main IBM sites and see what you can find\n(Hint: look at RACF and Unix System Services).\n\nOther vendors give away MVS Freeware, try;\n http://www.dignus.com/\nand many others.\n\n\nPERSONAL SITES                  (this character ~ is a tilde)\n==============\n\nBill Lalonde (<billlalonde@rocketmail.com> has a site with links to\nmany freeware sites.\n http://members.tripod.com/~billlalonde/\n\nDave Alcock's site includes his own contributions and links to other\nfreeware sites;\n http://planetmvs.com\n\n\nDavid Pitts has ported the GCC and EGCS compilers to USS. His site\nis at;\n http://www.cozx.com/~dpitts/gcc.html\nMake sure you read the instructions.\n\nAnother general interest site with downloads on it is at\n http://mainframes.com/\nIt appears to be the personal site of Mike Muuss <mike@arl.mil>\n\nIf you like ISRDDN, take a look at the website of the guy who wrote\nit, Doug Nadel;\n http://www.sillysot.com/mvs/\nThis is the site where you can find TASID.\n\nAshley Street <a.street@btinternet.com> has a page with some TSO and\nREXX stuff at;\n http://www.btinternet.com/~ashleys/fadh_software.htm\n\nMichael Cleary has a freeware page at;\n http://home.pacbell.net/mcleary/freeware.html\n\nYou can download Michael A. Newell's brilliant PDS2PDS dialog from;\n File 649 of the CBT Tape.   http://www.cbttape.org/ftp/cbt/CBT649.zip\nI cannot speak too highly of this contribution.\n\nGerard Nicol can be contacted at:\n gerard.nicol@tapetrack.com  Files 323 and 324 of the CBT Tape\ncontain his REXX Function Pack.\n\nMike Porter has a site at;\n http://manatee.nss.udel.edu/\nwhere you can download his SAPI code.\n\nThere is a lot of REXX and other TSO stuff at;\nhttp://users.arn.net/~mvsopert/\nfrom Rodney Hinds.\n\nDavid Elder-Vass has put a lot of his book about Systems Programming\nonto the web at;\n http://www.mvsbook.fsnet.co.uk/index.htm\n\nI had a lot of trouble with the frames on Nigel Pentland's site at\n http://www.cairnleck.co.uk/nigel/\nbut the RACF link did take me to a page of RACF downloads, although\nI haven't tried them.\n\nSam Knutson\n http://www.cbttape.org\nhas a lot of links to freeware sites which he updates faster than I\ncan update this list!\n\n\nRob Scott has some downloads at\n http://www.rocketsoftware.com/portfolio/mxi/index.htm\nwhich includes his MXI system information tool.\n\nThere does not appear to be any shareware at\n http://www.rexxla.org/index.html\nbut it's a good site to bookmark if you are looking for hints and\ntips on the REXX language.\n\nThierry Falissard's Home Page at\n http://www.os390-mvs.freesurf.fr/\nis one of those sites that gets indexed from lots of other places.\nBecause it's good.  He has not got much of his own freeware there,\nbut he has a lot of links to other freeware sites.  He does have\ndocumentation for IPOUPDTE, which is becoming hard to find, so\nthanks, Thierry.\n\nWhere would the CBT tape be without Gilbert Saint-flour? You can\ndownload his latest work from;\n http://mywebpages.comcast.net/gsf/\n\nCBT contributor Lionel B. Dyck puts his contribuions on the SHARE\n site;\n http://www.lbdsoftware.com\n\nAnother long time CBT contributor is Leonard Woren.

In\nServerPac, CPPUPDTE is supplied in the hlq.order_number.LOADLIB data\nset with an alias of IPOUPDTE.  IBM supports this program only\nwithin the documented installation processes for ServerPac and\nCBIPO.  They used to supply the instructions for using it in the\nDOCLIB data set, but do not do this in ServerPac.

Slightly\n       harder to install, but starts up faster.\n\n       To install this, create the load module and panel library\n       according to the installation instructions in the README file.\n       Then allocate the panel library to ISPPLIB and the load\n       library to ISPLLIB, or STEPLIB, or Linklist or LPA.\n\n tasid.zip  If you don't have access to the allocations, use a\n            CLIST like this:\n\n      ISPEXEC LIBDEF ISPPLIB DATASET ID('NADEL.TASID.PANELS') STACK\n      ISPEXEC LIBDEF ISPLLIB DATASET ID('NADEL.TASID.LOAD') STACK\n      ISPEXEC SELECT PGM(TASID) NEWAPPL(ISR) PASSLIB\n      ISPEXEC LIBDEF ISPPLIB\n      ISPEXEC LIBDEF ISPLLIB\n\n        The version with the panels built into the load module. Very\n        easy to install, takes a little longer to start.\n\n        To start this version, just create the load module and either\n        place it in one of the places listed above, or simply use the\n        TSO CALL statement, similar to:\n\n tasid0.zip       Option ===> TSO CALL 'NADEL.TASID.LOAD(TASID)'\n\n            or\n\n                  Option ===> TSO CALL TASID(TASID)\n\n  -------------------------------------------------------------------\n               Introduction from Doug Nadel's Home Page\n  -------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n                    A Few OS/390 Tools and Toys.\n\n  ------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nWelcome to my OS/390 Freeware page.
