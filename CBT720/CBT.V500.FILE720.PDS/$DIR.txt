ASMLAOPS - JCL to Assemble and Link MSGTABLE to IEAVMXIT

ASMLTABL - JCL to Assemble and Link MSGTABLE to IEAVMXIT, and then
           refresh IEAVMXIT with new messages
ASMLVMXT - JCL to Assemble and Link changes to IEAVMXIT

CATCLEAN - Old Assembler program that is provided as an example. It was
           written in MVS/SP, and it does the following: EXCP read
           of the VTOC, use of SVC 26 for Catalog function, read an
           ICF Catalog as a VSAM KSDS, and use SVC 99 dynamic allocation

CBR3750I - REXX EXEC sample that is placed in the SYSEXEC file defined
           in the OPSAUTO Started Task JCL. Entry must be defined in
           the MSGTABLE AutoOps member to be used by the IEAVMXIT exit

CLEANPDS - Assembler program to compare two PDS files, and delete
           members that are duplicate. Good for cleaning up old Linklist
           libraries, when vendor put all products in one library

COPYISPF - REXX EXEC that uses supplied Assembler REXX functions to
           copy PDS members and change the ISPF statistics. It is what
           was used to create this PDS with the squirrely CREATED and
           CHANGED dates (day I was born, and end of day if and when I
           turn 75)

COUTCPCM - Assembler program to issue VM CP commands (DIAGNOSE command)
           Good when running as a guest under VM, and you want to issue
           CP commands

COUTLOGC - Assembler program to create the next file on a multi-file
           tape. As an example, used when wanting to stack monthly
           SMF data on the same tape.

DASDBOX  - REXX EXEC that used the ALXRDASD REXX function to provide
           output of all defined DASD volumes in a BOX format. Uses
           a call to IDCAMS, and the DCOLLECT command to get the free
           space information. You must add IDCAMS to the IKJTSOxx member
           in PARMLIB, under AUTHPGM, in order to issue the CALL.

EZACICSE - Assembler CICS security exit for the TCP/IP Listener. I
           included it because I remember trying to find a sample when
           I had to write it

E0016    - REXX EXEC sample that is placed in the SYSEXEC file defined
           in the OPSAUTO Started Task JCL. This EXEC was used to
           track OAM messages issued by the VTS, and if a problem is
           identified, then the Operator's are told to use the 'Phone
           Home' feature of the VTS. EXEC is invoked because of the
           CBR3750I message, and is invoked from the CBR3750I EXEC

E0017    - REXX EXEC sample that is placed in the SYSEXEC file defined
           in the OPSAUTO Started Task JCL. This EXEC was used to
           track OAM messages issued by the VTS. EXEC is invoked because
           of CBR3750I message, and is invoked from the CBR3750I EXEC

IEAVMXIT - WTO/WTOR exit that will process all MVS messages that are
           defined for automation in the MSGTABLE entry

INRECXIT - Assembler Network Print Facility (NPF) input record exit
           for inserting HP PCL in the print stream. NPF was free from
           IBM, so if you are using it, the exit might help

LCB      - REXX EXEC that can be executed from ISPF 3.4 data set list,
           to issue an IDCAMS LISTCAT and return the information in
           an ISPF Browse session. EXEC includes the code to display
           the last modified TIMESTAMP as something you can read

MESSAGE  - Assembler MACRO used to build MSGTABLE used by IEAVMXIT.
           Macro is located in SYS2.ISPF.LOCAL.MACLIB

MSGTABLE - Assembler table created by the ISPF/REXX AutoOps interface,
           and contains all of the messages to be processed by IEAVMXIT

MSGTABLE - Assembler Table used by AutoOps application. It is built
           using the supplied ISPF/REXX panels and EXECs included in
           this PDS. It currently contains sample entries that should
           be removed when you are ready to use it.

OPSAUTO  - JCL PROC used by the AutoOps application and invoked as
           an MVS START command from the IEAVMXIT

PDSPCLOD - PC REXX EXEC to take the output from PDSUNLDV program and
           place the members in a directory on your PC

PDSRELDV - Assembler program to rebuild a PDS from the PDSUNLDV program.

PDSUNLDV - Assembler program to create a sequential file from an FB
           or VB PDS, for unloading from the mainframe. Use PDSPCLOD
           REXX EXEC on your Personal Computer to unload the members
           into a directory (you can download REGINA if you want to
           run REXX on your PC). Does not retain the ISPF STATs info.

SSCLKPDS - Assembler program that allows the SSCUCPDS program to issue
           Multiple change commands. The name of the SSCUCPDS program
           is contained in this program, so if you change it, you must
           change it in this program as well.

SSCUCPDS - Assembler program written in 1984 to perform mass edits of
           multiple PDS or sequential files. Originally used as a
           migration tool for doing massive changes to libraries with
           JCL. Program only works on RECFM FB, LRECL 80 files, because
           it maintains the integrity of column 72 within the code.
           The default is to show you what the changes would look like
           before actually changing the files. Once satisfied, specify
           PARM=CHGE to perform the change. Program also has a
           parameter function to SCAN PDS files, without doing any
           changes. SSCLKPDS program was written later, so that
           multiple change input control cards could be supplied.

SYSURDR  - Assembler program that will allow you to build and submit
           a job from the Operator Console. Program issues WTORs, and
           when complete, submits the job for execution. I saw this
           done on DOS/VSE and thought it was a good idea if the
           network was done. REXX using the ALXRWTOR assembler
           function would be easier to maintain, but I figured I'd
           include this program.

SUBTTIME - REXX EXEC that will take two date/time fields as input
           arguments, and calculate the time difference. Found it
           useful in AutoOps when making a decision on the frequency
           of an occurrence

TAPESTCK - Assembler program that was originally written to convert
           from 3480 tape to 3590 tape. Program will stack the input
           files on to the output tape, and build the necessary IDCAMS
           DELETE/DEFINE control cards to recatalog the input files to
           the new media. Also builds CA1 SCRATCH control cards, if you
           need them. Will support 64k blocks.

VARYOFF  - REXX EXEC that uses ALXRDASD REXX function and input control
           cards to vary selected DASD offline at IPL time. Allows you
           to specify selection criteria

VARYOFFJ - Started Task JCL for invoking VARYOFF EXEC

VARYOFFP - Control card input to VARYOFF EXEC
