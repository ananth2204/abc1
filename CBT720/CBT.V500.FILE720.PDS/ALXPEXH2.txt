+      The use of the SEARCH facility allows you to SELECT a message if
+   argument or JOBNAME is found. This might save you from having to
+   process the message with an EXEC.
+
+      The Multi-Line option must be used for WTOs that contain multiple
+   lines, and you wish to process the subsequent lines. A specification
+   of Y (yes) informs the exit that you wish to process a Multi-Line WTO.
+   If you were to specify a Search argument, then the WTO line that
+   contains the search argument will be what is presented to the EXEC.
+   If you specify A (all), then the exit will pass all lines of WTO once
+   it finds the search argument. If you specify Y, and no search
+   argument, then every line of the WTO will be passed to the EXEC.
