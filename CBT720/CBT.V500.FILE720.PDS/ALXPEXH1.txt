+     xxxxx   is taking advantage of the WTO exit IEAVMXIT to process
+   WTO/WTOR messages generated on the OS/390  system. Rather than modifying
+   the exit every time a new message must be added the exit was written to
+   be table driven. The use of these ISPF Panels and a REXX EXEC will
+   allow you to add new messages to the table used by IEAVMXIT.
+
+     The six  Functions available are: REPLY (which allows you to reply
+   to an outstanding WTOR), COMMAND (which allows you to issue a command
+   to MVS), EXEC (which takes the message and invokes a REXX EXEC to
+   process the specified MSGID), HIGHLITE (which takes the message and sets to
    not roll and color Red), SUPPRESS (which will suppress the message from
    both SYSLOG and consoles), or EVENT (which takes the message and invokes
+   REXX EXEC $E to process). Remember, if the EXEC Function is selected then
+   someone must create a REXX EXEC in SYS2.ISPF.AUTOOPS.REXX with the same
+   name as the MSGID. The EXEC will be executed and as much of the
+   message that can fit within the 100 byte Parameter limit will be passed to
+   the EXEC (Actually, (100 - MSGID - 1) (subtract 3 more if a WTOR)).
