Hi Sam

Here is now the corrected version:

CHANGES by Eugene Vogt:
2010-09-017 FIXED SYSOU MVI ERROR
2010-09-018 INSERTED ESA AND Z/OS RELATED MISSING TEXT UNITS
            ALL CHANGES HAVE BEEN MARKED WITH EUGENE VOGT
            BUT HAVE NOT BEEN TESTED.

I tested Subsystems with subparms and it works ESA - z/OS .

I stuffed all documentation found into ONE macro called CECDYN
(at the bottom).

I guess it is the most up-to-date MACRO concerning SVC 99 text
unit generation found on CBT or the internet.

If there is as mentioned a new version around let me know so I
can cross check.

So paid my tribute I hope so anyway;)

Cheers
Eugene
