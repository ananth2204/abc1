//***FILE 857 is from Marco Serafini and contains a REXX EXEC and   *   FILE 857
//*           several panels, to execute an interactive report      *   FILE 857
//*           against the active LOGREC dataset, or against any     *   FILE 857
//*           archived copy of LOGREC.  Tested at z/OS 1.6 thru     *   FILE 857
//*           1.10 by the author, and at 1.12 by Sam Golob.         *   FILE 857

//*           This system is very nice, to be able to see what is   *   FILE 857
//*           in LOGREC, with almost no effort.                     *   FILE 857

//*           There is also some word doc, but it is in Italian.    *   FILE 857
//*           Still, you can get a ton of use out of this package   *   FILE 857
//*           without reading the words of the doc, but by looking  *   FILE 857
//*           at the illustrations.                                 *   FILE 857

//*           Just copy 6 panels into your panel library and run    *   FILE 857
//*           the EXEC.                                             *   FILE 857
