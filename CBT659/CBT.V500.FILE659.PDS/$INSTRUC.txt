      (If you already have an MVS system running, then you only
       need what's in-between these comments.                    below
  --------------------------------------------------------------------
  0. Member HERC306 is just about the entire HERCULES, Level 3.06,
      which is in zip format.  Download in BINARY to a PC, unzip it,
      and execute Hercules directly from the directory.  Execution
      command is:

      hercules -f c:\path\of\config.file     (example)

      How to make a config file is another question entirely.  Go
      to the Hercules web site for that:  http://www.hercules-390.org/

      This version of Hercules runs on Windows (MSVC) and does not
      need Cygwin at all.

      It would be helpful if you had a TN3270 emulator.  I'd suggest
      VISTA from www.tombrennansoftware.com, but any emulator should
      do.  Set the emulator to 127.0.0.1 and IP port 3270.  If you
      are an "advanced user", do as you see fit.  After you have
      run the hercules -f command, and before you issue the IPL
      command, open the emulator window, and the HERC initial screen
      should pop up.  Then IPL the target MVS system.

      If you want to run FTP from MVS, you will have to install the
      Win-P-Cap package on your MVS machine.  Use member WINPCAP,
      and download it in BINARY to your PC.  Give it an .exe designation
      on the PC and execute it.  It will install WinPcap 4.0.2 on your
      PC.  This is needed, to get TCP/IP to work.  Then you have to
      customize the PROFILE member of your TCPIP proc on MVS, and
      make a similar designation on your Hercules config file.

      If you want to run the latest operating systems, use members
      HERC306 and WINPCAP, and DO NOT use member HERC216, which is
      too old to run them.

  1. Backup a DASD volume to a disk file using DFDSS.  You must be
      licensed to use DFDSS.  For this file you will need about half the
      amount of space of the total usage of the volume you are backing
      up.  An empty volume would be best.  You will need RACF access to
      resource class FACILITY profile STGADMIN.*
      Use member DFDSSBK to create this file.

  1A. Once you have a DFDSS backup on the source system, and you have
      made an XMIT file from it, using the command:

      XMIT node.uid DSN(your.backup.dataset) OUTDSN(volser.XMI)

      and you have sent it off the MVS system to your PC, making
      sure you have done the (FTP) transmission in BINARY, you have
      all the info to re-create the pack under Hercules.  Use the

      RECEIVE INDS(volser.XMI)

      command on the target MVS system (making sure the XMIT file is
      FB and LRECL=80), and run the INITPACK and DFDSSRS jobs on the
      target MVS system, to initialize and restore the target disk
      pack.  Remember that the pack must be OFFLINE for INITPACK to
      run, and ONLINE for DFDSSRS.  Then you won't need the
      subsequent steps.  You only need them if you have NO MVS under
      Hercules at all.  Then you'll have to create it from scratch,
      and that is what the rest of the steps below, will accomplish.

      If you want to use FDR instead of DFDSS, I've included FDR jobs.
      But the output files still have to be put into XMIT format for
      transportation off the source MVS system, and onto the target
      MVS system.

      (If you already have an MVS system running, then you only
       need what's in-between these comments.                    above
  --------------------------------------------------------------------

  2. Create an AWSTAPE formatted disk file from the backup disk file.
      For this file you will need the same amount of space as the backup
      file.  Another empty volume would be best.
      Use member AWSTAPE to create this file.

  3. Create an XMIT formatted disk file from the AWSTAPE disk file.  For
      this file you will need the same amount of space as the backup
      or AWSTAPE format.  Another empty volume would be best, but at
      this point you can delete the backup file from step 1 and use that
      volume.  You will need to increase the OUTLIM parameter in
      IKJTSOxx in SYS1.PARMLIB OUTLIM(50000000) should do, while your
      there you may as well increase the OUTWARN parameter to
      OUTWARN(500000,150000) also.  After you create the new IKJTSOxx
      member with the new limits, you'll need to activate it with the
      parmlib update command PARMLIB UPDATE(xx) under TSO or READY.
      You will need RACF access to resource class TSOAUTH profile
      PARMLIB
      Use member XMITAPE to create the file.

 **** If you don't want to use GZIP proceed to step 9 ****

  4. Download member GZIP from this dataset to your PC in binary as
      GZIP.EXE into a new directory called C:\GZIP

  5. Get MVS GZIP loadlib from member GZIPXMIT by entering the
      following under TSO or READY replacing youruserid with your userid
      or what ever this dataset name is.  This will create a datset
      youruserid.GZIP.LOADLIB
      RECEIVE INDA('youruserid.FILE659.PDS(GZIPXMIT)')

  6. Create a GZIP formatted disk file from the XMIT disk file.  For
      this file you will need less space then the XMIT disk file.
      Another empty volume would be best, but at this point you can
      delete the AWSTAPE file from step 2 and use that volume.
      Use member GZIPFILE to create the file.

  7. Download the youruserid.vvvvvv.XMI.GZ to your PC in binary as
      vvvvvv.XMI.GZ into directory C:\GZIP
      Replacing vvvvvv with the DASD volume you're creating.

  8. Unzip the vvvvvv.XMI.GZ on your PC.  Startup a DOS session, for
      WIN/xp click Start then Run then type in CMD then click OK.  In
      the DOS session change the directory to C:\GZIP with command
      CD\GZIP now enter the command to unzip the XMI DASD file:
      gzip -d vvvvvv.XMI.GZ
      Replacing vvvvvv with the DASD volume you're creating.
      Proceed to step 10

  9. Download the youruserid.vvvvvv.XMI to your PC in binary as
      vvvvvv.XMI
      Replacing vvvvvv with the DASD volume you're creating.

 10. Download and install Hercules Version 2.16.5 onto your PC.
      Download member HERC216 to your PC in binary as Herc216.zip
      then unzip this file to it's own directory called C:\HERC216

 11. Download and install XmitManager Version 3 to your PC.
      Download member XMITMAN to your PC in binary as XmitManager-v3.zip
      then unzip this file to it's own directory.  Install XmitManager
      by executing Setup.exe.  This is a great tool.

 12. Extract the AWSTAPE file from the XMI file with XmitManager by
      opening the vvvvvv.XMI file and click Extract, change the name to
      remove your userid prefix to look like this vvvvvv.AWSTAPE.bin
      into directory C:\HERC216\TAPE
      Replacing vvvvvv with the DASD volume you're creating.

 13. Create a DFDSSSAR card image disk file.  You must be licensed to
      use DFDSS.
      Use member DFDSSSAR to create this file.

 14. Download the youruserid.DFDSSSAR to your PC in binary as
      DFDSSSAR into directory C:\HERC216\CARD

 15. Create a empty DASD volume with Hercules DASDINIT.  Startup a DOS
      session, for WIN/xp click Start then Run then type in CMD then
      click OK.  In the DOS session change the directory to C:\Herc216
      with command CD\HERC216 now enter the command to create an empty
      DASD file:
      DASDINIT vvvvvv 3390-3 vvvvvv
      Replacing vvvvvv with the DASD volume you're creating.
      This will create a empty CKD_P370 3390-3 device that can be read
      by a P/390, Flex-ES and Hercules emulators.  The file names will
      be vvvvvv_1 and vvvvvv_2 the volser will be vvvvvv.
      Since there is a 2 Gig limitation it creates two files.

 16. Startup Hercules under a DOS session, for WIN/xp click Start then
      Run then type in CMD then click OK.  In this DOS session change
      the directory to C:\Herc216 with command CD\HERC216.
      To start Hercules enter command:
      HERCULES -F CONFGSAR.CNF
      Hercules should now be running in this DOS session.  You should
      see the following on the topline:
      Hercules Version 2.16.5
      and at the bottom line you should see:
      HHC602I Waiting for console connection on port 33

 17. Configure your PC Telnet 3270 emulator to talk to Hercules.
      Set the Host Name or IP Address to: 127.0.0.1
      Set the Type to: Telnet
      Set the Port to: 33
      Set the Device Name to: 0AE0
      Click Connect
      At this point you should see the following on your Telnet session:
      Hercules version 2.16.5 built at Jul  8 2002 08:42:33 device 0AE0
      running on yourpc (CYGWIN_NT-5.1 1.3.10(0.51/3/2))
      At the bottom of your DOS Hercules session you should see:
      HHC604I Client 127.0.0.1 connected to 3270 device 0AE0

 18. Attaching devices needed to restore a DASD volume to the CKD_P370
      file under Hercules.  Enter the following attach commands on the
      DOS session Hercules command line:
      attach 000D 1442 C:\HERC216\CARD\DFDSSSAR
      attach 0120 3480 C:\HERC216\TAPE\vvvvvv.AWSTAPE.bin
      attach 0100 3390 C:\HERC216\vvvvvv_1
      Replacing vvvvvv with the DASD volume you're creating.

 19. It's now time to IPL the DFDSSSAR.  Enter the following on the
      Hercules command line in lower case:
      ipl 000D
      On the connected Telnet 3270 terminal hit enter four times until
      you see the following message separated by blank lines.
      ENTER INPUT/COMMAND:
      Then enter the following:
      RESTORE NOVERIFY FROMADDR(0120) FROMDEV(TAPE) TOADDR(0100)
      You will then receive the following message.
      ADRY003D  0100 REPLY Y TO ALTER VOLUME CONTENTS, ELSE N
      Reply
      Y

 If you have to repeat step 19 you will need to detach 000D and 0120
 then attach them again as in step 18, these are tape and card files and
 need to be rewound for the tape file and placed back in the hopper for
 the card file. Detach command: detach 00d

 That's it.  You can now use this CKD_P370 3390 file on any of the
 following hardware emulators:
 P/390, Flex-ES and Hercules.

 All comments welcome.
