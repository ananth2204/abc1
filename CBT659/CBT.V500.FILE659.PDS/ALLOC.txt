//IBMUSERM JOB ,'my name here',CLASS=B,
//    MSGCLASS=X,NOTIFY=&SYSUID
//*
//*  Sample allocation job for an XMIT of a large DASD volume
//*   backup.  You can add more potential work volumes to hold
//*   large datasets.  Make sure that the XMIT file is FB-80.
//*   You can do that using the ZAP 'format4.dscb' VOL(vvvvvv)
//*   command on the vvvvv1 volume, and zap +54 from the Format1
//*   VTOC entry for the XMIT file to X'90', and +58 to X'0050'.
//*
//*  The ZAP command can be found in the LOADLIB member of this
//*   pds, which is in XMIT format.
