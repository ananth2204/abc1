Here is the IRXFLOC rexx function package.

There are 20 functions in the package. I am also attaching the
"usage instructions" for all the functions in the package.

To be most efficient, IRXFLOC should be in LNKLIST but will work
as a member of STEPLIB.

    * Two members are an .XMI  format of a PDS.

this.pds(IRXFLOC)  will yield a single loadmodule member
this.pds(HELP)  will yield a FB80 library of 20 members
