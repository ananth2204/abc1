 Name:        @CURSOR

 Purpose:     Extract the data at the cursor position of an ISPF panel.

 Environment: REXX subroutine/function for ISPF.
              @CURSOR resides in the IRXFLOC "function package".

 Features:    @CURSOR can be used within any ISPF application
              regardless of the panel.

              Non-ebcdic characters from the panel are replaced
              with blanks (if no argument is specified).

 Arguments:
           1. (optional) Specify an argument of any value
              (even a "null" literal) to cause @CURSOR not to
              replace non-ebcdic characters with blanks.

 Results:     Four values as follows:
                 - the "word" (within REXX context) in which the
                   cursor is positioned.
                 - the position of the cursor within that string
                 - the (screen) column number where the cursor was
                   positioned
                 - the data of the entire (screen) row where the cursor was
                   positioned

              Note that the entire screen row is the image of the
              panel line. Attibute positions are mainatained but
              will contain a blank unless an argument is specified
              for @CURSOR

              If the cursor was not positioned at a "word", @CURSOR
              returns the four values as above except that "word" is
              assigned the value of hexadecimal zero and the
              position of the cursor within the word is zero.

 Errors/Warnings:
              @CURSOR returns -3 when used outside a valid ISPF
              environment.


 Examples:    Refer to the @SYSDSN command.
