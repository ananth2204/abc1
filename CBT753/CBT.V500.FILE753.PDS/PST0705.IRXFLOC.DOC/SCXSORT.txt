 Name:        SCXSORT

 Purpose:     Sort from and/or into REXX stem variables.                e

 Environment: REXX subroutine/function for all MVS/ESA environments.
              SCXSORT resides in the IRXFLOC "function package".

 Features:    All the capabilities of the system sort program are
              available.

              Use of stem variables is not mandatory. SCXSORT may be
              used to manipulate files as per normal.

              SORT's control statements are coded as values assigned
              to specific REXX variables. Each control statement
              uses a REXX variable name of the format SCX._____
              where _____ is the name of the control statement
              e.g. SCX.SORT = 'FIELDS=(1,8,BI,A)'

 Arguments:   There are two possible arguments; both are optional.

           1. The name of the stem variable containing the
              input "records". (If this argument is omitted, SORT
              will obtain the input records from SORTIN or as per
              the MODS control statement.)

              The argument (when used) must specify a stem variable
              name including the period. It should/must be enclosed
              within quotation marks.

              If there are non-existent variables within the range
              of stem.1 and stem.n, then stem.0 must contain the
              value of "n" to cause SCXSORT to ignore the
              non-existent variables.

           2. The name of the stem variable to receive the output
              "records".  (If this argument is omitted, SORT will
              dispose of the output records to SORTOUT or as per the
              MODS control statement.)

              The argument (when used) must specify a stem variable
              name including the period. It should/must be enclosed
              within quotation marks.

              SCXSORT normally uses stem.1 for the first output
              "record".  If stem.0 is assigned the value "n", then
              output begins at stem.n. This technique can be used
              to add entries to an existing range.

 Results:     Direct results for the REXX exec are only produced
              when argument two is used. In that case the stem
              variables are (re)filled and stem.0 contains the value
              of the number of the last stem filled.


 Notes:
    It is recommended that scx.RECORD always be used.  Default for
    stemmed input is scx.RECORD = 'TYPE=F,LENGTH=(length(stem.1))'.
    SCXSORT will abort when scx.RECORD is not assigned and stemmed
    output is requested but stemmed input is not.

    Misrepresentation of RECORD TYPE/LENGTH will create
    unpredictable results.

    If SCXSORT is to be used multiple times within one exec, ensure
    that only those scx.____ variables required for each SCXSORT are
    in force before the invocation. It may be necessary to DROP
    SCX.___ variables (e.g. scx.SUM = 'FIELDS=NONE')

    Control of SORT's message is accomplished through the $ORTPARM
    DDname. Once a particular use of SCXSORT is stable and SORT's
    messages are to be suppressed (and allocation of SYSOUT
    avoided), then $ORTPARM should be allocated to
    SYS1.UTILPARM(SORT@NOL)

    In certain situations, SCXSORT can be an alternative to EXECIO.
    SCXSORT can be used to read a VSAM dataset into REXX stem
    variables
