 Name:        SCCALLOC

 Purpose:     Provide native REXX with the equivalent of TSO
              ALLOCATE and FREE

 Environment: REXX subroutine/function for Address TSO or MVS

 Features:    Refer to argument 1 formats


 Arguments:
           1. The first argument is the ddname operand. It may be
              specified in one of six  formats.
            .1  A single ddname representing the dd to be
                allocated/freed.
            .2  A list of ddnames to be freed. The ddnames must be
                separated by at least one blank. With this format,
                argument two is ignored.
            .3  A single ddname with a plus sign (+) appended as a
                suffix. This is to indicate that the dataset(s)
                specified at argument 2 are to be concatenated ahead
                of those aleady allocated to the specified ddname.
                Note that the ddname does not necessarily have to
                be pre-allocated for this format.
            .4  A single ddname with a question mark (?) appended as a
                suffix. This is to indicate that the dataset(s)
                specified at argument 2 are to be allocated only if
                the ddname is not already allocated. Note that the
                dataset(s) specified at argument 2 are verified
                even if the ddname is already allocated.
            .5  A single ddname with a equal sign (=) appended as a
                suffix. This is to indicate that the ddname
                specified at argument 2 is to be allocated to the
                datasets already allocated to the ddname (without
                the suffix) at argument 1.
            .6  A single ddname with an underscore (_) appended as a
                suffix. This is special means of telling SCCALLOC
                not to check the catalog and existence of the dataset(s)
                specified at argument 2. This format should be reserved
                for temporary (i.e. VIO) datasets.
            .7  A single ddname with left parenthesis appended as a
                suffix. This format will cause SCCALLOC to allocate a
                system determined ddname to a member (specified in
                argument 2) within the (first) dataset represented by the
                ddname specified (without the suffix) at argument 1.
                SCCALLOC will return the system determined ddname.
           2. (optional - if omitted the specified ddname is freed)
              The (list of) dataset name(s) to be allocated. Names
              must be specified in JCL format; quotes are not used,
              high level node is required.

              If allocating to the member level, specify the member
              name as per JCL; i.e. enclosed in parenthesis and
              appended to the library name.

              If allocating to a relative GDG, specify the GDG
              level as per JCL; i.e. enclosed in parenthesis and
              appended to the GDG index name.

              For formats 2, 5 and 7 of argument 1, argument 2
              also  has special format

            .2  null

            .5  The ddname from which the new allocation will be
                made.

            .7  The member name to which allocation is required.

 Results:     The direct result of the subroutine/function is a
              logical value indicating whether or not the requested
              function was performed. Refer to the example 1 below.

              The variable RC is set as per the return code from
              LOCATE/OBTAIN/DYNALLOC.

              For format 7 of argument 1, the result is the system
              determined ddname. If the dynamic allocation fails the
              the result is 0 (zero).

              In error situations, appropriate messages are generated.
              The messages after a DYNALLOC failure are formatted to
              assist the programmer maintaining the SCCALLOC program
              and are to be used in conjunction with the IBM manual
              "Authorized Assembler Programming Langauge Programs"
              (GC28-1645) chapter 23.  Error code 0218 0000 will be
              generated if the dataset is catalogued to a tape (i.e
              "not mounted") device.


 Examples:
  1. Conditional allocates as well as multiple frees.
      /* REXX */
      Call Initailize
      Call Process
      Call Terminate
      exit
      Initialize:
           dd_s = ''
           if SCCALLOC('DD1?','MY.DATASET')   then dd_s = dd_s 'DD1'
           if SCCALLOC('DD2?','YOUR.DATASET') then dd_s = dd_s 'DD2'
        return 0
      Terminate::
           if dd_s \= '' then SCCALLOC(dd_s)
        return 0

  2. Remove a specified dataset from the SYSEXEC allocation.
      /* REXX */
      ? = dsn4dd('SYSEXEC')
      if ? == arg(1) then dsn_s = ''
      else dsn_s = ?
      do i = 1 to rc-1
           ? = dsn4dd('SYSEXEC+'i)
           if ? \== arg(1) then dsn_s = dsn_s ?
      end
      call SCCALLOC 'SYSEXEC', dsn_s
      exit

 Notes:
   SCCALLOC will allocate only to existing datasets. It always uses
   a disposition of SHR.

   A relative GDG is automatically resolved to its absolute dataset
   name. Do not use SCCALLOC to achieve that resolution; rather use
   SCC@DSN to determine an absolute gdg name without allocating it.

   SCCALLOC provides only limited allocations operands i.e. DSNAME
   DDNAME/FILE and SHR. SCCALLOC's purpose is to allow a non-TSO
   application to allocate to existing datasets.  TSO applications
   should utilize the ALLOCATE command unless a feature of SCCALLOC
   is required.

   If an uncataloged dataset is (pre)allocated and format 3 of
   argument 1 for that ddname is requested, a DYNALLOC failure will
   occur.

   Failures may render an unexpected allocation environment i.e
   partial unallocates/allocates
