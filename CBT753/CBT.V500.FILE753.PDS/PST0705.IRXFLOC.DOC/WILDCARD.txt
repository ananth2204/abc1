 Name:        WILDCARD

 Purpose:     Set a logical value as to whether or not the first
              argument is 'matched' to the second argument.

 Environment: REXX subroutine/function for all MVS/ESA environments.
              WILDCARD resides in the IRXFLOC "function package".

 Arguments:
           1. The selection criterea. The criterea is composed of a
              combination of natural characters and/or two 'wildcard'
              values. The natural characters must be matched (within
              positional context) to the second argument value.

              The 'wildcard' values and their action are:
                 '*' (asterisk) will 'match' to any value of any
                     length (including zero) in the 'target'.
                 '%' (percent sign) will 'match' any value in the
                     'target' but the corresponding 'target' position
                     must be occupied i.e not null

              'Wildcard' values can be specified multiple times.


           2. The 'target' field. This argument contains the value
              the selection criterea will attempt to match.


 Results:    1 means the 'target' is matched.

             0 means the 'target' is not matched.


 Examples:
             wildcard('PST*','PST0705') --> 1

             wildcard('*705','PST0705') --> 1

             wildcard('*07*','PST0705') --> 1

             wildcard('*0%0*','PST0705') --> 1

             wildcard('PST0705%','PST0705') --> 0

             wildcard('PST%','PST0705') --> 0

             if wildcard('ANYMEM*',mem) then
               do
                  call sccpdsr('PDS1',mem,'MEM.')
                  do i = 1 to mem.0
                       if find(mem.i,'COPY') then call read_copy
                  end
               end
