 Name:        SCCQWVAR

 Purpose:     Extract QwikRef text into (REXX stem) variables.

 Environment: REXX subroutine/function for Address TSO or MVS.
              Also available to CLISTs

 Features:    Optionally 'stack' the output

              Environment independence

              Echo return codes from QWIKREF1


 Arguments:   (For REXX, SCCQWVAR should only be used as a subroutine
              or function.)

           1. (required) The name of the QwikRef item to be retrieved.

           2. (optional) The name of the REXX variable stem to be
              populated. This specification should be terminated by
              a period (a period is generated if not specified) and
              enclosed in quotes (to avoid inadvertent symbolic
              substitution).

              If argument 2 is omitted, the extracted items are
              placed in the program stack.


 Results: (REXX)
              The variable name specified at argument 2 is
              popualated.  stem.0 is assigned the value of the
              number of stems used.

              Alternately if argument 2 is not specified, the items
              are placed in the program stack.

 Results: (CLIST)
              The variable name QWTXTVAR is assigned the value of
              the entire string of text.

              The condition code is set to the length of the value
              in QWTXTVAR

 Results: (exceptions)
              SCCQWVAR will abend (S806) when the load module
              QWIKREF1 is not available (via the LINK macro).

              The REXX variable 'rc' (return code) is set as per
              QWIKREF1. Refer to the MVS QwikRef manual for details.

              If IKJCT441 (CLIST processing) fails, its return code
              is reflected as a negative value.

 Notes:

   All extraction from the QwikRef databases is performed by the
   program QWIKREF1. SCCQWVAR is the interface between REXX/CLIST
   and QWIKREF1. Refer to the MVS QwikRef Guide for more details.

   Despite the fact that SCCQWVAR is environment independent, the
   proper dataset allocations (for QWIKREF1) must be
   pre-esatablished.

   The items retrieved are 78 bytes each even when that 78 bytes is
   all blanks.

   SCCQWVAR has an arbitrary limit of 3000 * 78 bytes for the data
   interface to QWIKREF1.
