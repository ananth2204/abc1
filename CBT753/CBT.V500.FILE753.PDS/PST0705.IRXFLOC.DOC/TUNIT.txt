 Name:        TUNIT

 Purpose:     Convert JCL syntax into SVC 99 parameters (for DYNALLOC)

 Environment: REXX subroutine/function; can not be run as a TSO command
              The function has no TSO dependencies.

 Features:


 Arguments:   If only one argument is specified, it is presumed to be the JCL
     1. DDname

     2. JCL to be converted.


 Results:     A series of 'tunit' values ready for the DYNALLOC function


 Notes:
 1. JCL validity is not verified and incorrect syntax may cause the
    function to abort.

 2. Some non-JCL mnemonics can be used. They include  SVC 99 parameters
    makes it very versatile. Unfortunately, understanding how to
    properly code the SVC 99 parameters is not simple. The IBM manual
    "Authorized Assembler Programming" (GC28-1645) chapter 25. must be
    studied in order to exploit this function.

 3. Although it is possible (see note 2), DYNALLOC can perform all
    the functions that SCCALLOC does but Rexx programmers will find
    SCCALLOC much easier to use (and no less efficient) for:
       - allocating to an existing dataset with DISP=SHR
       - de-allocation
       - conditional allocation
       - re-assigning a DDname
       - obtaining a system determined DDname

 Examples:
  1. Allocate ddname SYSPRINT as DUMMY
       call dynalloc '00010052000000240000000100010008'x || 'SYSPRINT'

  2. Allocate ddname PDS to VIO
       call dynalloc '00010052000000530000'x                ||,
                tunit('PDS','DISP=(NEW,KEEP,KEEP),UNIT=VIO' ||,
                ',SPACE=(8880,(6,6,2))'                     ||,
                ',LRECL=80,BLKSIZE=8880,RECFM=FB,DSORG=PO')
