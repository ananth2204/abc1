 Name:        XDATE

 Purpose:     Convert a date from one format to another.

 Environment: REXX subroutine/function for all MVS/ESA environments.
              XDATE  is part of the system function package
              IRXFLOC as modified by Stelco.

 Features:    Various date formats are supported.

              Logical dates can be converted to actual dates

 Arguments:
           1. (optional) The date to be converted. This argument can
              be specified in one of eight formats.

              The default is to extract the current (calendar) date
              from the system.

            . (Gregorian)  yymmdd   yy-mm-dd   yy mm dd
            . (U.S.)       mm/dd/yy
            . (Julian)     yyjjj   yy jjj
            . (shipping)   yy ww d
            .              YESterday TODay TOMmorrow SUNday MONday ...
               'yy' = two digit year
               'mm' = month of year
               'dd' = day of month
              'jjj' = Julian day of year
               'ww' = (Stelco shipping) week number
                'd' = day of week (1=Sunday, 2=Monday, ..., 7=Saturday)
              The punctuation characters of '-' (dash), '/' (slash) and
              ' ' (blank) must be used as shown.  Formats which include
              punctuation may omit high order zeros except that in the
              'yy mm dd' format the 'dd' value must always be 2 digits
              to distinguish it from the 'yy ww d' format.  Formats
              without punctuation must specify all (high order) digits.

              For the 5th format (alpha abbreviation), only the first 3
              characters are significant to the XDATE function. The
              day-of-the-week is presumed to be in the future (e.g.
              next FRIday) unless the specifications is prefaced with
              '-' (minus sign) (e.g. -SUN=last SUNday).  Similarily the
              minus sign prefix can be used with YESterday, TODay and
              TOMmorrow to yield a date a week earlier.


           2. (optional) This argument is significant only when date is
              specified as 'YESterday', 'TODay', or 'TOMmorrow'. It
              specifies when the day's schedule begins.  Many
              application schedules do not align with the start of a
              calendar day, i.e. midnight. Thus, for a shift which
              overlaps midnight, 'today's schedule at 02:00 a.m. refers
              to the previous calendar day.

              The default value is 08:00:00


           3. (optional) A code indicating how the result is to be
              formatted
                 U - U.S. format             - mm/dd/yy
                 E - European format         - dd/mm/yy
                 I - International format    - yy-mm-dd
                 J - Julian format           - yyjjj
                 S - Stelco shipping format  - yy ww d  ('d' = numeric day of we

              The default value is "U" which is also used (without
              warning) if argument is specified as a value other than
              those listed.

           4. (optional) Any value (including a null character string)
              to indicate an extened result is required.  The format of
              the extended result is:
                 result  yy  mm  dd  ww  d  jjj  mon  day  l  yyyy
              where:
                 'result' is as per the 'format' requested.
                 'yy'     is the (two digit) year (excluding century)
                 'mm'     is the month of the year
                 'dd'     is the day of the month
                 'ww'     is the (Stelco) week of the year
                 'd'      is the day of the week (1 = Sunday; 7 = Saturday)
                 'jjj'    is the Julian day of the year
                 'mon'    is the 3 character abbreviation for month.
                 'day'    is the 3 character abbreviation for the day of the wee
                 'l'      is the leap year indicator
                          (1 = leap year; 0 = non-leap year)
                 'yyyy'   is the (4 digit) year including the century


 Results:     The date in the format requested.

 Usage Notes:

 1. The input date may represent a 'logical' date. The month, day,
    and week values may be overstated or zero. When a value is
    overstated only the rightmost significant digits are used. (e.g.
    if 'ww' is specfied as 456, then 56 is used.). 'Logical' dates
    are converted to their actual equivalent.

    Use zero for day-of-month and overstate the value of month by
    one to obtain the date for the last day of the required month.
       e.g. XDATE('92 03 00',,'I') ==> '92-02-29'

 2. Use of the extended results for Stelco shipping dates is
    discouraged.  Year-end dates can be confusing.
      e.g. XDATE('930102',,,'')  ==> 01/02/93 93 01 01 53 7 ...
           XDATE('930102',,S,'') ==> 92 53 7  93 01 01 53 7 ...

 3. A request to convert TODay may not yield the same result as a
    request for the system date. The system date is always the current
    calendar date. "TODay" may be adjusted according to the time of day
    when the request is made. If a request for 'TODay' (using default
    time) is made before 08:00, then the result is one day earlier than
    calendar day.

 3. XDATE is a REXX interface to Stelco's corporate date routine
    named STSS011.
