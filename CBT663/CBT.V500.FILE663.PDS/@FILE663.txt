//*      This project is to create a public domain runtime          *   FILE 663
//*      library which conforms to ISO/IEC 9899:1990.  It is        *   FILE 663
//*      expected to be highly OS-specific, but hopefully not too   *   FILE 663
//*      compiler-specific.  It is the job of C library             *   FILE 663
//*      developers to make unportable but fast code, not that of   *   FILE 663
//*      the application developers.  Anyone wishing to             *   FILE 663
//*      contribute to this project, please contact Paul Edwards    *   FILE 663

//*      Borland have some restrictions on the use of their         *   FILE 663
