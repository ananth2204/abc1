Naming conventions for File 663 members:

    Because C naming conventions on the pc were used in the
    distribution of this file, and they had to be moved to an
    MVS format, several things were done:

 1.  ASCII was translated into EBCDIC throughout.

 2.  Members of this pds, were created with the suffix name,
     and the individual sources were IEBUPDTE (or PDSLOAD)
     combined into each pds member.  For example, ASSERT.C
     as distributed in the original distribution, can be found
     in the pds member called C, as submember ASSERT.  The only
     exception to this convention is the MAKEFILE member, where
     the submembers are the SUFFIX.  For example, MAKEFILE.BCC
     is submember BCC in member MAKEFILE.

 3.  Two sources in the distribution which didn't have suffixes
     are included as members of the base pds.  These are:
     MVSOPTS and MVSZIP.

To re-create all the pds'es necessary, from this pds, please
customize and run the job called $PDSLOAD.  The load library
containing the PDSLOAD load module is in XMIT format in this
pds, as member PDSLOAD.  To retrieve the load module, do:

  TSO RECEIVE INDS(this.pds(PDSLOAD))
