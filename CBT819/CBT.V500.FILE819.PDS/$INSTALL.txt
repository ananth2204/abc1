         Installation Steps for the "ICH" Facility

 1) Choose an APF-Authorized Load Library to link program
    "ICHLOADR" into.  It must be an APF-Authorized
    Load Library.

 2) Edit member "ASSEM" (assembles/links program "ICHLOADR")
    and meke tailoring changes (Change the Source location
    and the Load Library etc).
    The load library that "ICHLOADR" resides in must be
    APF-Authorized and program "ICHLOADR" must be Link
    Editted with AC=1.

    Submit member "ASSEM" to assemble/link program
    "ICHLOADR" into the Load Library chosen in step
    step 1) above.

    Alternately, member "LINKEDIT" is included if you only
    want to run the LINKEDIT (BINDER) step.  You must
    tailor this member per the comments before submitting
    it.

 3) If program "ICHLOADR" was placed into a LinkListed
    Load Library (in step 2) above), no changes are
    necessary for REXX exec "ICH" (member "ICH") and
    you can procede to step 4).

    If exec "ICH" will NOT be placed into a LinkListed Load
    Library, EDIT member 'ICH' and do a FIND for the word
    "Uncomment". Find the  occurance of the word which
    contains the "CALL" statement with the explicit CALL
    to program "ICHLOADR".

    Uncommnent the explicit call statement and change the
    Load Library in the CALL statement to the dataset name
    chosen in step 1) above.

    COMMENT out (nullify) the LinkListed Call statement
    just below it. (/* CALL *(ICHPROGR) */)

 4) Copy REXX exec member "ICH" into a PDS or PDSE which
    resides in an exec allocation (SYSPROC SYSEXEC etc.) to
    allow it to be invoked as a REXX exec.  The PDS or PDSE
    dataset that you choose should be RACF protected so that
    only authorized users have UPDATE access to it.

 5) Add program "ICHLOADR" to the IKJTSOxx MVS Parmlib
    member in the Authorized Programs Table section so it
    can be executed as an authorized program.
    (Or whatever Authorization equivalent you have).

 6) Issue the following TSO command to Syntax check the
    IKJTSOxx member that you have changed.

       PARMLIB CHECK(xx)

 7) If the Syntax is acceptable, isse the following TSO
    command to implement the IKJTSOxx member that you
    changed.

       PARMLIB UPDATE(xx)

    (Or you can use the MVS Command:  SET  IKJTSO=xx

       SET IKJTSO=xx

     if your OS is at Z/oS V1.R3 or above)

 8) Add Load Library 'SYS1.LPALIB' (or whatever Load Library
    you put your RACF exit into when you run REXX exec 'ICH')
    to the APF LIST if it is not presently in the APF List.

 9) Tailor and Submit member "PROGCNTL" to Add RACF
    program-control protection for program "ICHLOADR" to
    allow only authorized users from executing this program.
    It updates the RCVT pointer addresses, so access to it
    should be restricted to only authorized users.

10) Tailor and SUBMIT member "COPYHELP" to copy the HELP
    member for REXX exec "ICH".
    Choose a PDS or PDSE library which is concatenated to
    the SYSHELP ddname allocation list.
    The HELP member will be RENAMED on the copy from
    "HELPICH" to "ICH".

11) Test the HELP panel by issuing TSO command HELP ICH.
    Read the HELP Screen to learn how to use the "ICH" exec
    facility.  This is your MVS README file.

12) Now you are an expert.  Test this on a test system first
    before implementing on a production platform.

13) Browse member "@FILE819" and READ my "DISCLAIMER OF
    LIABILITY".  In other words, USE AT YOUR OWN RISK
    or "Implementer caveo" - (Implementer Beware).

14) Happy RACF User Exit updating and loading.
