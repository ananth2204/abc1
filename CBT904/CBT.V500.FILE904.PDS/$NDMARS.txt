Instructions on how to install the C:D ARS SAS members.
-------------------------------------------------------

Step 1.  Copy some or all of the following members into the dataset
         referenced by the DD name SDGAMAP (or your equivalent)

         (o) ACTIVTY1
         (o) ACTIVTY2
         (o) ACTVSECP
         (o) EXCEPT1
         (o) NPDSCPY1
         (o) PDSCOPY1
         (o) RUNJOB1
         (o) RUNTASK1
         (o) SUBMIT1
         (o) SUMMACTC
         (o) SUMMARY1

Suggestions on execution of the C:D ARS SAS programs.
-----------------------------------------------------

1).      You can reference and modify the sample JCL provided in member
         DGAJARS2 of the SDGAJCL library. This sample job executes two
         job steps. The first, DGADBATC, performs a SELect STATistics
         command and stores the statistics records in a temporary
         dataset. The second job step executes the ARS SAS program(s)
         using the temporary dataset created in the previous step as
         input.

2).      See the sample JCL members; CDJARS2$ and CDJEXTR$ provided in
         this library. These samples illustrate a method of extracting
         STATistics records to a "Catalogued" dataset and executing the
         ARS (SAS) reports against that dataset. As a Service Bureau, we
         execute many ARS reports for various clients. We have found
         that repeated "SEL STATs" commands can adversely effect the
         performance of the Connect:Direct task. To remediate this
         situation, we perform one extract per day and then execute ALL
         subsequent reports against this "extracted" dataset.
