Instructions on how to install the C:D Netview Automation members.
------------------------------------------------------------------

Step 1.  Copy some or all of the following members into a dataset
         referenced by the DD name DSICLD in your Netview PROCedure.

         (o) SNDMAIL6              (written in Rexx)
         (o) SVTM083I              (written Netview Clist language)
         (o) SVTM105I              (written Netview Clist language)

         If you seperate your Rexx code from the Netview Clist code
         then segregate as appropriate!


Step 2.  Copy some or all of the MPFLST statements provided in member
         MPFLSTXX into your production MPFLSTxx member. You only need
         to copy statements for those messages that you wish to suppress
         or automate.

         Refresh your MPF list after making any changes:

                - SET MPF=xx


Step 3.  Copy some or all of the Netview MAT statements provided in
         members CDXOR01X and SVTMxxx to your production Netview
         Message Automation Table. You could usea %INCLUDE statement
         include the entire tables fragments in your production tables.
         You only need to copy or include those statements for messages
         that you wish to automate.

         Refresh your Netview Message Automation Table after making any
         changes:

                - AUTOTBL MEMBER=xxxxxxxx,TEST

         It is always a good idea to TEST the Message Automation Table
         first, to esure there are NO errors.
