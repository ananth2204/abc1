Instructions on how to install the C:D OPLIST members.
------------------------------------------------------

Step 1.  Reference the Connect:Direct initialization member and locate
         the MCS.CLIST statement.

         (o) MCS.CLIST = SYS2.NDM.OPLIST

Step 2.  Copy some or all of the following members into the dataset
         referenced in (1):

         (o) IDBG
         (o) QUI
         (o) QUIESCE
         (o) RES
         (o) RESUME
         (o) XO

Step 3.  Ensure that you have a valid MCS.SIGNON statement specified in
         the Connect:Direct initialization dataset/member:

         (o)  MCS.SIGNON = (SIGNON USERID=(SUPERUSR,SUPPASS1) -
                            CASE=NO                           -
                            NETMAP=$CD.NETMAP)

Step 4.  Ensure that the USERID specified in the MCS.SIGNON statement
         (SUPERUSR in this example) is defined in the Connect:Direct
         AUTH VSAM file with the correct password (SUPPASS1) and the
         appropriate functional authority.


    NOTE ** Depending upon the security software that you have **
         ** installed, you may have other options or different **
         ** standards for defining and authorizing the CONSOLE **
         ** USERID!!!                                          **


Step 5.  You can choose between the pair of Resume and Quiesce Oplists.
         The QUIESCE and RESUME Oplist will quiesce and resume the LOCAL
         node if a node name is not provided in the commands.

         ** Quiescing the LOCAL node will SOP ALL processes.   **

         Using the QUI or RES Oplists will result in an SRTA032I or
         SRTA031I error message respectively, if a node name is NOT
         provided on the command invocation. Use the latter two Oplists
         if you do NOT want the ability to Quiesce or resume the LOCAL
         node !!!
