Instructions on how to install the Perl script members.
-------------------------------------------------------

Step 1.  Unload the PERL member of this PDS using the TSO RECEIVE
         command:

         (o) RECEIVE INDA('this.pds.name(PERL)')

Step 2.  When you get the following prompt:

         INMR901I Dataset SCNS.HDGA510.PERL.PDS from SCNS03T on MVSJEST
         INMR906A Enter restore parameters or 'DELETE' or 'END' +

         Provide your desired restore parameters. If you simply press
         ENTER, you should load a dataset named 'hlq.HDGA510.PERL.PDS'
         Where 'hlq' is your TSO high level qualifier!


    NOTE ** The Perl scripts in this PDS all have an LRECL > 80**
         ** Consequently the restored PDS will have a LRECL=255**
         ** Once it is restore you can copy the members into   **
         ** a HFS of your choice!!                             **

    NOTE ** These Perl scripts were originally developed for   **
         ** Connect:Direct Unix (V3.5) running on Solaris 9 in **
         ** the 2004 time frame. They ran in this environment  **
         ** up to and including C:D Unix V3.8.                 **
         ** After the upgrade to V3.8 our Production Groups    **
         ** were reorganized and there was a desire to produce **
         ** these reports and archive them on the mainframe.   **
         ** At that time, we installed Perl on z/OS (the FMID  **
         ** is HPRL110) and the perl version was:              **
         **                                                    **
            This is perl, v5.8.7 built for os390-thread-multi

         ** These scripts were easily moved to z/OS with very  **
         ** little modification.                               **
         ** From 2012 on, these scripts were executed on z/OS  **
         ** USS and the resulting reports were archived on SAR **
         ** (CA-View) for historical reference.                **
