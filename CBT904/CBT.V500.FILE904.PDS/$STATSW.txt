Instructions on how to install the C:D STATs SWITCH process.
------------------------------------------------------------

Step 1.  Reference the Connect:Direct initialization member and locate
         the STAT.SWITCH.SUBMIT statement.

         (o) STAT.SWITCH.SUBMIT = your.ndm.process.lib(member)

Step 2.  Code the STAT.SWITCH.SUBMIT parameter to reference the PDS
         and the member that contains the statistics switch process.
         If your process library is named SYS2.NDM.PROCESS and you use
         the process member name provide in this example, then code:

         (o) STAT.SWITCH.SUBMIT = SYS2.NDM.PROCESS(STATPRC4)

Step 3.  Copy the statistics switch job (STATJOB4) into the JCL library
         referenced in the RUNTASK statement in the STATPRC4 process.
         If your JCL library is named SYS2.NDM.CNTL and you use the
         the jobname member provided in this example, then code:

         (o)      RUN TASK (PGM=DGADTSUB,
                  PARM=("DISP=SHR,DSN=SYS2.NDM.CNTL(STATJOB4)",
                               "DSNAME &EDSN"))


    NOTE ** The statistics switch process runs as a PNODE=SNODE**
         ** process. You must have an adjacent node coded in   **
         ** your NETMAP to support Pnode=Snode processing. In  **
         ** the process you must code both the PNODE and SNODE **
         ** parameters to be your node name. You could also    **
         ** PNODE=%PNODE, but my experience has been that the  **
         ** intrinsic variable, %PNODE does NOT work for the   **
         ** SNODE parameter. Consult the Connect:Direct Admin  **
         ** Guide for more details!!!                          **


Step 4.  Depending upon your security requirements, you may also need
         to code a userid in the STAT.USER parameter. This userid will
         need sufficient access to submit the process and JCL provided
         in the previous steps.

    NOTE ** Depending upon the security software that you have **
         ** installed, you may have other options or different **
         ** standards for authorizing the STAT.USER userid.    **


    NOTE ** In this example, the JOB submitted when the Stats  **
         ** file switches contains two steps. The first step   **
         ** executes ListCat Plus (PGM=LSTCAT) to produce the  **
         ** VSAM statistics report. If you do NOT have ListCat **
         ** Plus, you can change the first job step to use the **
         ** IDCAMS utility instead. The second job step runs   **
         ** the Connect:Direct utility named DGASSTAT. This    **
         ** program provide additional statistics on the VSAM  **
         ** file including a report of All of the record types **
         ** in the statistics file and the space they consume. **
