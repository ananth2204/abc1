Instructions on how to install the TSTA3390 C:D Allocation exit
---------------------------------------------------------------

Step 1.  Modify and Run the TSTA339$ JCL from this dataset to assemble
         and link the TSTA3390 source code. Any "lower case" characters
         must be changed to suit your environment. This JCL member was
         coded with the assumption that Connect:direct was installed
         into libraries with a high level qualifier of IBM.HDGA510. You
         must change these entries to match your install dataset names!


Step 2.  Change the Connect:Direct initialization member to include
         a statement to load the exit:

         (o) ALLOCATION.EXIT = TSTA3390


Step 3.  Place a DD Card in the DTF JCL for DISPLAY output. (optional)

         (o) //USRINFO  DD SYSOUT=A


Step 4.  Restart the Connect:Direct task - installation is complete!




Instructions on how to install the TSTSMF2 C:D statistics exit
--------------------------------------------------------------

Step 1.  Modify and Run the TSTSMF2$ JCL from this dataset to assemble
         and link the TSTSMF2 source code. Any "lower case" characters
         must be changed to suit your environment. This JCL member was
         coded with the assumption that Connect:direct was installed
         into libraries with a high level qualifier of IBM.HDGA510. You
         must change these entries to match your install dataset names!


Step 2.  Change the Connect:Direct initialization member to include
         a statement to load the exit:

         (o) STATISTICS.EXIT = TSTSMF2     /* test exit for XO records*/


Step 3.  Place a DD Card in the DTF JCL for DISPLAY output. (optional)

         (o) //USRINFO  DD SYSOUT=A


Step 4.  Restart the Connect:Direct task - installation is complete!




Instructions on how to install the TSTSUBMY C:D submit exit
-----------------------------------------------------------

Step 1.  Modify and Run the TSTSUBM$ JCL from this dataset to assemble
         and link the TSTSUBMY source code. Any "lower case" characters
         must be changed to suit your environment. This JCL member was
         coded with the assumption that Connect:direct was installed
         into libraries with a high level qualifier of IBM.HDGA510. You
         must change these entries to match your install dataset names!


Step 2.  Change the Connect:Direct initialization member to include
         a statement to load the exit:

         (o) SUBMIT.EXIT = TSTSUBMY      /* test exit to disable COMP*/


Step 3.  Place a DD Card in the DTF JCL for DISPLAY output. (optional)

         (o) //USRINFO  DD SYSOUT=A


Step 4.  Restart the Connect:Direct task - installation is complete!



Instructions on how to install the TSTXSIZP C:D submit exit
-----------------------------------------------------------

Step 1.  Modify and Run the TSTXSIZ$ JCL from this dataset to assemble
         and link the TSTZSIZP source code. Any "lower case" characters
         must be changed to suit your environment. This JCL member was
         coded with the assumption that Connect:direct was installed
         into libraries with a high level qualifier of IBM.HDGA510. You
         must change these entries to match your install dataset names!


Step 2.  Change the Connect:Direct initialization member to include
         a statement to load the exit:

         (o) SUBMIT.EXIT = TSTXSIZP      /* test exit to display size*/


Step 3.  Place a DD Card in the DTF JCL for DISPLAY output. (optional)

         (o) //USRINFO  DD SYSOUT=A


Step 4.  Restart the Connect:Direct task - installation is complete!
