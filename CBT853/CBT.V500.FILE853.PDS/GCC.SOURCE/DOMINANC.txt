/* This file implements the well known algorithm from Lengauer and Tarjan
   to compute the dominators in a control flow graph.  A basic block D is said
   to dominate another block X, when all paths from the entry node of the CFG
   to X go also over D.  The dominance relation is a transitive reflexive
   relation and its minimal transitive reduction is a tree, called the
   dominator tree.  So for each block X besides the entry block exists a
   block I(X), called the immediate dominator of X, which is the parent of X
   in the dominator tree.

   The algorithm computes this dominator tree implicitly by computing for
   each block its immediate dominator.  We use tree balancing and path
   compression, so its the O(e*a(e,v)) variant, where a(e,v) is the very
   slowly growing functional inverse of the Ackerman function.  */
