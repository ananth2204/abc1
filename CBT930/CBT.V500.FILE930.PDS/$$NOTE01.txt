Sam,

Now, for the detailed explanations, you can use any (or all) of
the following:


CALFILE IS A DIGITAL CALENDAR IN A FILE FORMAT With unique
features not available elsewhere.  It provides easier solutions
for date-interval issues with its continuous stream of individual
date records.  For the first time, every date is identified by
its correct weekday name.  Each date is also identified by the
exact occurrence of when that date falls within that month, i.e.,
the First Monday, the Last Friday, etc.  And all date conversions
between Gregorian and Julian are a snap regardless of whether a
leap year is involved or not.

    A dependable, accurate calendar that requires no maintenance
    Each Date is identified by its correct weekday name
    The exact interval between any 2 dates is easily determined?
    There are no issues with overlapping Months and/or Leap Years
    Can be used on a DB2 table or on any other platform
