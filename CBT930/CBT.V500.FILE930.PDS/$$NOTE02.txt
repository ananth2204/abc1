      Notes on Installation of the CALFILE and CALPRINT Programs
      ----- -- ------------ -- --- ------- --- -------- --------

1.  Create the load library containing the programs.

    Execute the $RECEIVE job in this pds, after changing the
    appropriate dataset names and output volume name to conform
    to your installation standards.

2.  Download the documentation member CALREF in BINARY to a PC.
    This is the reference manual in PDF format, which tells you
    how to use the CALFILE and CALPRINT programs.

3.  I have attempted to create a few sample jobs, called
    $CALFILx and $CALPRTx.  These are just a very few examples
    of what these programs can do.  See the reference manual
    for many more possibilites on how to set things up and
    print different kinds of calendars.

4.  Most of the message datasets used by the CALPRINT program have
    LRECL=125.  See member $CALPRT2 for a bit of guidance.  Actually
    the reference manual is the definitive place to go for help.
