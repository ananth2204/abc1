              CALFILE - The Interval Calendar File

The Interval Calendar File is an actual calendar in a file format
containing a continuous flow of individual date records.  This file
can be easily moved and used on other platforms.

The file contains individual date records in accurate and
sequential order where:

o 366 sequential Date Records exist for each Leap Year
o 365 sequential Date Records exist for each Non-Leap Year

All dates are identified by their correct weekday name and as the
first, second, third, fourth, fifth, or last time when it occurs
in a month.  This makes it easy to identify the last Friday or
the second Wednesday, etc.

Every record contains a sequential counter which then provides
quick answers for date interval questions.  The exact interval
between any 2 dates can be easily calculated.  It is also just as
easy to find another date simply by adding or subtracting a
number of days to the counter in the first date record.

The first record in the file is January 1st and has a value of
"000001" whereas the last record is December 31st of the final
year.

The file contains fixed-length 35-byte records.  The sample below
has a "starting year" of 2011 and has been intentionally spaced
for easier viewing.
