Have you ever needed to figure out the amount of time that has
elapsed between a couple of dates?  I frequently need to do this
and it isn't something I enjoy "tallying" up using my fingers.
Back in 1997 I wrote a C++ program to do the computation for me.
I was sort of curious to see how difficult it would be to write
in COBOL and I also wanted to make the output a bit more
polished.

The result is this small "main" program with an embedded
subprogram to process the command line parameter.  I use a call
to the Y2KLAGE subprogram to actually compute the period between
the dates.  Naturally, the most complex part of the problem is
isolating and validating the input parameter(s), so the most
significant portion of the program is the nested subprogram
'GETPARM'.

If you want to execute the program, you can download the compiled
executable.  It may be run from a DOS window under Windows
95/98/NT/2K.  It may also be run under a DOS window under OS/2.
Of course, it will also run just fine under MS/PC-DOS.  If you
execute the program without any parameter it will display the
parameter syntax.
