 See the 'Change history' section at the end for changes in this build.
 Download the 'FINDMEMP' as FINDMEMP.PDF and open it with a PDF viewer
 to see a perhaps better documentation.

 There are no changes to the database definitions, so a working product
 can be replaced by this build.


Introduction

 The WFM application is an ISPF application which allows you to find
 PDS/PDSE member(s) which existed at the latest WFM update run.

 The basis  for member info  load is  disk, so uncataloged  datasets are
 processed too.  This means that the  real name of a  dataset is stored,
 not any symbolic datasetname.

 Member(s) can be located by full name, name prefix or using
 Wildcards.

 The generated member list allows browse, edit and view of the member
 and the dataset where the member is found

 WFM is build using REXX + freeware programs, so is not as resource
 lean as a purpose built application probably would be. On the other
 hand a lot of thoughts have gone into making it perform reasonably. See
 the section 'Performance considerarions' later for hints.


Principles of operation

 The WFM infrastructure consists of 2 VSAM databases, one containing
 dataset names and one containing member names. The member database
 refers to the dataset database during member lookup.

 The databases are initially loaded using VTOC listings.

 The databases are updated by a daily run which scans SMF data for
 dataset update, scratch and rename. Both old-fashioned SMF history
 datasets and SMF logstreams are supported. Use either job JOBUPDSL or
 JOBUPDSH as reference.

 You can use the application while the update is running.

 The application is built using some freeware programs PDSMAIN (PDS86),
 RXVSAMBA and VTOC from www.cbttape.org file 192, 112 and 669
 respectively. A copy of those programs is provided as part of the WFM
 package.
 An alternate to PDSMAIN can be used by modifying the PDSMAIN=
 operand in the WFMSET member. SERENAs STARTOOL program has the same
 functionality and syntax as PDSMAIN as I recall.

 Several of the jobs use IBM DFSORT and ICETOOL. If you do not have
 those installed, I hope that you have useful equvivalents. Otherwise
 drop me a note and I shall see what I can do.

 Members with invalid names like 'B+......' are dropped durning load.


Getting started

 Unload the LIB dataset (you probably have done that already if you are
 Reading this).

 If you do not have either of the freeware programs PDSMAIN (PDS86),
 RXVSAMBA or VTOC installed, then un-xmit the program from the package
 lib to a loadlib. Update the JOBLIB parameter and statement in the
 WFMSET member accordingly.

 Edit the WFMSET member.

 Edit the WFMSTEPL member.

 Edit and run the JOBPRMCR and JOBDBCR jobs.

 Edit and run the JOBUPDVT member. If the VTOC and PDSMAIN programs are
 not available through LINKLIST/LPALIST then you must un-comment the
 STEPLIB statement. You might want to run the job several times with
 disk subsets. This will also allow you to monitor the size of the
 databases as you go along. Note that a lot of SMF type 14 will be
 generated, one per dataset scanned.

 Edit the WFMDIAGO member and tryout the dialog. Note that the RXVSAMBA
 program must be available.

 Continue with the section 'Daily update'


The ISPF dialog

 Execute the WFMDIAGO member.

 Enter HELP to see available primary- and line commands


Daily update

 Determine which job to use, depending on whether a SMF logstream is
 avaiable or not. Sample job JOBUPDSL reads from a logstream, JOBUPDSH
 reads from a history dataset.

 Edit the latest run info in the PARM dataset member LASTDATE. Enter
 the date when you started to add data to the databases.

 Edit and run the JOBUPDSH or JOBUPDSL member.
 The DATE= parameter is only used if you want to extract from a specific
 date range. The default is to read the parm member LASTDATE.

 Run the dialog to verify the updates.

 You can use the WFMSMX to pull SMF types 15, 17 and 18 as part of a
 SMF Dump process. This will make a much smaller dataset for WFMSMH.


Resync update

 This should be run at regular intervals. All disks are read so you may
 want to do this only once per week or even once per month.

 Edit and run the JOBUPDVT member.


Ad-hoc update

 Run this to update specific datasets.

 Edit and run the JOBUPDDL member.


Special considerations

 You can filter the disk volser list just before the update steps by
 using the WFMVSL proc. This can be usefull if you are not quite sure
 what VTOC ALL or the SMF extractor steps will pull in. See JOBUPDSH for
 a sample.

   JOBDBRLD  Reload DB from unload dataset
   JOBDBUNL  Unload DB to dataset
   JOBUPDDL  Update db using a ad-hoc dataset list
   JOBUPDSH  Update db from SMF history dataset
   JOBUPDSL  Update db from SMF logstream
   JOBUPDVT  Update db using VTOC list

 xxxx.UPD contains updates for the WFMDBA and WFMDBD procs.

 xxxx.DSN dataset database

 xxxx.MBR member database


Performance considerations

 The PDSMAIN (PDS86) program should be in  LPALIB as it is used a lot by
 the load and update jobs. The RXVSAMBA and VTOC programs are used a lot
 less, but may also be copied to LPALIB.

 If you cannot add the programs to  LPA, then you could at least execute
 them from VIO as follows:

   Edit the  JOBUPDxx member you  want to  run, add the  following after
   EXEC WFMCTL:

   //          EXEC WFMVPG,LOADLIB='loadlib.with.programs'

   Update the WFMSTEPL member:

   //STEPLIB DD DISP=SHR,DSN=&&VIOLIB


Security considerations

 The databases are read directly by the dialog, so must have universal
 access READ.
 The userid for the update job must be able to read all PDS(E) datasets
 and update the databases, so it is recommended that the userid has
 OPERATIONS attribute.


Change history

 Build 002 (current)
  The SMF filters have been modified, so at the very least you must
  replace the members WFMSMHI2 WFMSMLI3 and WFMSMXI1.
