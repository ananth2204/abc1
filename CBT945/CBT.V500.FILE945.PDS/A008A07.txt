IDCAMS EXAMINE

The IDCAMS EXAMINE command can be used to analyse the
index and data components of a KSDS to produce reports on
the structure of the individual components. The format of the
command is presented below. We have found the command to
be useful in checking that our ICF user catalogs are not corrupt
in any way, and also in providing us with statistics on each of
the user catalogs in the system. This job uses IDCAMS to list
all the user catalogs relating to the system it is being executed
on, and then stores the associated output in a temporary
dataset. This output is then used as input to the REXX EXEC,
EXAMREXX. This EXEC builds a jobstream similar to that
presented below. This jobstream is then input to the internal
reader in STEP3 of the process below.

The jobstream that is built will issue the EXAMINE command
for each user catalog's index and data components. The source
for the EXAMREXX program is presented below.

We execute the program on a regular basis and by doing so we
can ensure that no structural errors are found on the catalogs
and also obtain statistics on catalog activity, control intervals,
and space usage. The output for a single catalog is presented in
Figure 1.

By utilizing the REXX EXEC we have ensured that when we
remove catalogs or add new ones the process requires no
amendment because the EXAMINE statements are built
dynamically. Further modification to the initial jobstream could
be performed to add a final step that would process the output
from EXAMINE and report automatically on structural errors
or if the Free Space in a catalog had fallen below a certain
level. We have not done this because we do not have too many
catalogs in our environment; however, if your Data Centre
utilizes a lot of catalogs it may not be feasible to review the
output manually.


FORMAT OF IDCAMS EXAMINE COMMAND

EXAMINE   NAME(cluster) -
          INDEXTEST|NOINDEXTEST -

          ERRORLIMIT

Note: ERRORLIMIT can be used to restrict the number of
output messages but continue with the test.
