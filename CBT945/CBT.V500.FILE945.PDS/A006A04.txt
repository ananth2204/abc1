Use of VBS in VSAM

We have a large, variable blocked ESDS VSAM dataset that is
created in batch for subsequent read-only access from our
production CICS system (Version 1.7 under MVS/XA 2.2). It
was defined with a CISIZE of 6144 with a maximum logical
record length of less than 6144.

It was determined that we would have to cater for the record
size being increased beyond 6144 and so decided to research
the use of variable block spanned record format. We found that
we could change the VSAM definition to use VBS without
having to change any application programs on our CICS
system. Potentially the maximum logical record size will be
26,000 bytes.

Having changed the definition of the production file the next
time it was loaded we noticed that the disk space the file
occupied was significantly less. The saving is in the order of
12% on an original file size of 3,413 megabytes, a saving of
over 700 cylinders on our 3380s.

Obviously this percentage of saving is unique to this file but a
conversion from VB to VBS format, which is invisible to CICS
and the application, will almost always make some saving.
