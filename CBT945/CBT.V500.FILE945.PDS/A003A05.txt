Deleting uncatalogued VSAM datasets

Have you ever experienced VSAM datasets that could not be
deleted because the master or user catalog where the dataset
was catalogued had been deleted?  Using ICF catalogs, the
dataset has entries in the VTOC for both the data and index
parts of the cluster, and this may result in a lot of unusable
space on the volume.

If you are not able to recatalogue the dataset in another catalog,
then, of course, you could back up the volume, create a new
VTOC, and restore all data except the unwanted dataset.  But
in most cases this cannot be done during prime-time, and if the
volume contains linklist libraries, APF libraries, or other
critical datasets, this may not be possible at all (except by
IPLing another system).

One way to get rid of the dataset is by zapping the VTOC.
This article describes how you can do it.

First, you list the VTOC entries for the dataset (both data and
index part) in hex dump format, to get the cylinder-track-record
address of the format 1 DSCBs, and the contents of the fields
you want to change.

Then you run the VTOCZAP1 job to remove the expiration
date, to flag the dataset as physical sequential (PS) instead of
VSAM, to remove the ICF catalog flag, and to remove the
password required flag.  After this job, the system believes that
the dataset is a straightforward physical sequential dataset (if
the dataset has no more than 16 extents), and you can easily
delete it in any way you like.

When updating the VTOC by AMASPZAP you must answer Y
to the following message on the system operating console:

      AMA1I7D REPLY Y OR N TO UPDATE VTOC volser cuu jobname.

If the VSAM dataset has more than 16 extents and you try to
delete the dataset at this stage you will get a permanent I/O
error message and lose your VTOC index (message: IEC606I
VTOC INDEX DISABLED ON cuu,volser,.....).  In this case
you must run job VTOCZAP2 to reset the extent counter to 16
and remove a pointer from the format 1 to the two format 3
DSCBs.  (The format 1 DSCB contains information for the first
three extents, and a pointer to a format 3 DSCB which contains
information for 13 additional extents.  In the case of an ICF
dataset with more than 16 extents, two or more format 3
DSCBs are linked together, but for other types of dataset 16
extents is the maximum allowed.)

Now you can delete the dataset, but the additional extents are
lost, and must be taken care of separately.

This could be done in two ways.  If the original two format 3
DSCBs are intact, you could allocate a dummy dataset and fill
it with enough records to make exactly three extents (to fill the
extent information in the format 1 DSCB).  Then you can run
job VTOCZAP3 to update the extent counter to the total
number of extents, update the pointer from the format 1 DSCB
to the format 3 DSCB, and update the extent sequence numbers
in the format 3 DSCB.  Now you can delete your dummy
dataset.

On one occassion, the original two format 3 DSCBs were
zeroed out when the VSAM dataset was deleted, therefore I
allocated a dummy dataset with just one extent.  Then I ran job
VTOCZAP4 to fill in extent information for two extents at a
time.  The extent information (lower and upper limit addresses)
you can get from the listing of the original format 3 DSCB.
After deleting the dummy dataset, this must be repeated until
all extents are taken care of.
