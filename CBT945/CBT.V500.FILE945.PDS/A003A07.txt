Correction

Jesse Joyner  has written with a correction to his article Delete
VSAM user catalog, which was published in issue 1 of VSAM
Update.  The execution JCL has an error in VSAMLIST.  The
line

      // DLBL IJSYSLS,'VSAM.DEL.SYSLST',1,SD

should be replaced by:

      // DLBL IJSYSLS,'INFOPAC.SYSLST',1,SD
