VSAM for VM users

For sites running VSE under VM it is possible to use the more
user-friendly facilities associated with CMS to develop and test
VSE/VSAM programs before they go live.

In order to do this, a virtual machine must be created under
VM. The directory entry for this virtual machine must contain
MDISK statements for each VSAM volume used and must also
LINK to the VSE system residence volume. Because the
volumes used for VSAM are effectively VSE disks, they
require a VTOC. Initializing the disk space and installing the
VTOC can be carried out using the DSF (Device Support
Facilities) program.

Before VSAM can be used from VM it is necessary to SET
DOS ON. This creates an environment similar to a VSE
partition. It is necessary to include in the command the
filemode of the VSE system residence pack, for example V, in
order to access system libraries etc. Also, to indicate that
VSAM will be used, the VSAM option must be included with
the SET command. An example of the command is:

      SET DOS ON V (VSAM

It does no harm to specify the command more than once. In Â¨
order to check whether DOS is on, the QUERY DOS command
can be issued.

To perform any VSAM-related task from CMS involves
placing the AMS commands and parameters in a file. The file
can have any filename, but must have a filetype of AMSERV.
The commands are executed by the Access Method Utility
(AMSERV) program. This is achieved by entering:

      AMSERV filename

Where filename is the name of the file containing the AMS
commands and parameters. AMSERV processes the commands
and produces a report with the same filename as the original
AMSERV file, and a filetype of LISTING.

The next task to be performed is the creation of the VSAM
master catalog. The steps necessary to create the master catalog
are:

      ASSGN SYSCAT B

This is emulating VSE and assigns the system logical unit for
the master catalog to the filemode letter of the disk.

      DLBL IJSYSCT B DSN VSAMCAT (SYSCAT PERM EXTENT

This creates a disk label for the master catalog. The system will
respond by asking for the starting track and total number of
tracks. These are entered with a single space separating the two
numbers.

The master catalog can then be defined, for example:

DEFINE MASTERCATALOG (-
 NAME (VSAMCAT) -
 VOL (VSAM01) -
 CYL (2) -
 FILE (IJSYSCT))

These commands are placed in the AMSERV file.

Other VSAM entities such as space and clusters can be defined
in a similar way, although space does not require an ASSGN or
DLBL. The AMS REPRO command can be used to place
records in files. This, again, requires the use of ASSGN and
DLBL to describe the input file.

Before a user can make use of VSAM under VM it is necessary
for them to go through a number of steps. First they must
ACCess the VSAM disks and the VSE system residence
volume, eg:

      ACC 123 V

They must then go into VSE emulation mode, ie:

      SET DOS ON V (VSAM

Finally, ASSGNs and DLBLs must be specified for the master
catalog and any clusters that have been defined, eg:

      ASSGN SYSCAT B
      DLBL IJSYSCT B DSN VSAMCAT ( SYSCAT PERM

For convenience, these commands are usually placed in an
EXEC that can be started by a user, or included as part of their
PROFILE EXEC.

When the user has finished working with VSAM it is necessary
to RELease the disks that have been accessed, terminate DOS
mode, and remove the DLBLs. For example:

      REL V
      SET DOS OFF
      DLBL IJSYSCT CLEAR

These commands are also usually run from an EXEC.
