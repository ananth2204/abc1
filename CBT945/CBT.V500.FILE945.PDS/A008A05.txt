Synchronizing catalogs and CRAs

The RESETCAT job will allow you to synchronize the catalog
with the CRA on each volume. For example, the catalog
CATTP01 owns 10 volumes (LYO007 to LYO010 ), and has
been defined with the recoverable attribute. If you have a
multi-volume file, you will sometimes need to use the
RESETCAT job, which will access the file. It can be useful,
for example, when you cannot delete a file with the attribute of
IGNORE ERROR.

An example of the output is shown in Figure 1.
