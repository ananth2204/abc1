REUSE and performance

Although the REUSE parameter is not directly related to
performance, it can be used with performance-related
parameters when the physical location of a dataset on a DASD
is to be fixed.

The BINDDATA command can be used to put the index
component tracks in cache, when cache controllers are being
used. There are many occasions when it is necessary to ensure
that the physical address of the index component on the DASD
does not change. This can be achieved by using REUSE. The
advantage of doing this is that there is no need to delete or
reallocate that particular cluster in order to reorganize it. When
the dataset is REPROed with the REUSE parameter, or when it
is opened for OUTPUT by a COBOL program, all the old
records are apparently deleted by automatically setting to zero
the HURBA (High Used Relative Byte Address) in the catalog.
The net effect is that the file appears to be newly allocated
except that the physical location of the index and data
components on the DASD are exactly the same as before.
