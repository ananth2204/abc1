IMBED and performance

When defining a KSDS (not an ESDS or RRDS) it is possible
to specify the IMBED parameter.  IMBED, which can be
shortened to IMBD, affects the sequence set component of an
index or an alternate index.  When IMBD is used, the sequence
set is duplicated around  a track on a disk as many times as it
will fit.  The use of IMBD should reduce the amount of time
taken to access the data on a disk because, theoretically, it will
take less time for the disk to rotate to a position such that the
heads are over the start of the sequence set.  Once the sequence
set has been read, the data component can be accessed.  If
there was only one copy of the sequence set, the disk would,
on average, have to rotate more before the heads were over the
start of the sequence set.  Therefore, IMBD should, in general,
be used in preference to the default NOIMBD.

However, there is a price to pay for the performance
improvements.  If duplicate copies of the sequence set are to be
made, more disk space will be used to store the file.  With
IMBD, the sequence set occupies the whole of the first
physical track of the data Control Area.

If the Control Area allocation is two tracks, the IMBDed
sequence set will use one of them.  This reduces the effective
data CA utilization by 50%.  Therefore, when using IMBD,
performance improvements can best be achieved by allocating
space for the data component in cylinders.
