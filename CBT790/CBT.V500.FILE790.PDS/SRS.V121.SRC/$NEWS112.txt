What's new in SRS 1.1.2 ?

1. Support for HELD datasets.
   Prior to release 1.1.2, only 'ready', non-held output datasets could
   be processed.  The new STATUS= parameter allows NONHELD (the
   default), HELD, or ALL datasets to be selected.

2. Elimination of S001-3 abends.
   Prior to 1.1.2, when SRS attempted to process a sysout dataset that
   was not closed properly by JES (usually as a result of a system
   crash), the SRS subtask would receive a S001-3 abend and processing
   would terminate.  In 1.1.2, SRS intercepts the abend and generates
   messages similar to the following:

   SRS050E DWDSRS  ,SRS     ,JES ,I,SYSSAPI ,GET   ,READ ERROR     ,
           **************,QSAM
   SRS051E I/O error reading spool dataset RMF.RMF.STC37951.D0000102.?

   Note that SRS050E reports error information provided by the SYNADAF
   service routine.  SRS will then continue as if end-of-file had been
   encountered on the dataset, and will resume normal processing,
   selecting more datasets if appropriate.  If SRS encounters an I/O
   error reading a dataset, it will not count the dataset for LIMIT
   checking.

3. STC/TSU support for JOBID (JI=) parameter.
   Prior to 1.1.2, users had to specify JOBnnnnn on the JI= parameter,
   even to select STC and TSU output.  The JI= keyword now honors
   STCnnnnn and TSUnnnnn specifications, and will select only the
   desired jobid type (for example, JI=STC1234 will not select JOB1234).

4. Miscellaneous.
   Several bugs have been corrected:
      ABEND0C4 HASCHAM+4F6
      Loop when WAIT=YES specified
   A few messages have been clarified with expanded error text.
