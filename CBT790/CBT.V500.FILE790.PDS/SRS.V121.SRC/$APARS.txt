Problem: Message SRS100E SSOB RETN=32 RESN=36 when an 8-character DEST
         and a JOBNAME is specified.
         SRS supports up to 8 character destination ID's via the
         DEST= keyword.  SAPI supports up to 18 characters in the SSOB
         SSS2DEST.  Code in SRSTASK incorrectly moves 18 bytes from
         the DEST field in the TBLK to the SSOB.  When the adjacent
         field in the TBLK (which happens to be the JOBNAME) is
         non-blank, a logic error results on the SAPI SSI call.
Fix:     Expand the SRS DEST field to 18 characters.
