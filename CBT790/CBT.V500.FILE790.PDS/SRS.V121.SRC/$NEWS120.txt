What's new in SRS 1.2.0 ?

1. Select by DDNAME.
   The DDNAME= keyword filters the selection of spool data to data
   sets with a specific DDNAME.  For example DDNAME=JESJCL will
   select only the JES JCL listing data set.  Wildcarding is supported.

2. PARM support for despool program.
   The PPARM= keyword can be used to pass up to 80 characters to the
   despooler program.  If the string contains commas, it must be
   specified within parentheses.

3. WTO changes.
   - Minor changes were made to SRS505I
   - The DDNAME of the data set selected is now included on SRS001I
   - SRS010I is no longer issued with DESC=2
   - New message SRS002I is issued when DDNAME= was specified and a
     job was found that matched the selection criteria but did not
     contain the desired ddname.

4. SRSGENER Enhancements:
   Several enhancements were made to the default despooler program.

   - New parameters can be passed on the PPARM= keyword:

     OUTFILE= can be used to specify the DDNAME despooled records
     are to be written to.  In prior releases, SYSUT2 was the only
     choice.  SYSUT2 is the default.

     DEFER_OPEN=YES/NO specifies whether the OUTFILE= file should
     be opened at SRS initialization or after the first record is
     despooled.  If 'YES' (which is the default) is specified and
     no LRECL is specified on the OUTFILE= file, SRS will use the
     record length of the first record despooled as the LRECL.
     If 'NO', LRECL must be specified on the OUTFILE= file or a
     S013-34 abend will occur.  'NO' may be useful if OUTFILE=
     specifies a tape device and SRS ends with RC=4 (indicating no
     spool files matched the selection criteria) before the tape
     is mounted.

   - New message SRSG01I indicates the DDNAME and DSN despooled
     data is being written to.

   - Corrected a problem where if multiple data sets with different
     LRECL's were despooled, the smaller data sets were sometimes
     written with data from a previous data set.

   - Message SRSG02W will now be issued for each data set that has
     a record length greater than the OUTFILE= file LRECL (indicating
     possible data truncation).  In prior releases, this message was
     issued only once per output group for the first data set
     truncated.

5. Miscellaneous.
   - A warning message is issued if the SYSPARM DD is used to specify
     SRS PARMS.  Support for SYSPARM will be dropped in a future
     release.  (Specify SRS parms on the EXEC PARMS= keyword).

   - Fixed S0C4 when the despooler program requests termination on
     the initialization call.

   - Set RC=8 when SRS510E (No SYSOUT selection criteria specified) is
     issued.
