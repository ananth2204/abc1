Hi Sam,

I have found an error in the FRAC function as submitted by Deru
on file 670.

I have been in touch with him, and I have coded a fix to it. He
said I should submit it back to CBT as long as I put my name in
the updates.


The fix to the FRAC function corrects the following error:
frac(1.65)= 0.625

after the fix it now returns
frac(1.65)= 0.649999976

The problem was with the use of an unnormalized result forcing a
bad alignment when adding back to the original normalized value.
I have added a normalized "ADD of Zero" to correct this.
