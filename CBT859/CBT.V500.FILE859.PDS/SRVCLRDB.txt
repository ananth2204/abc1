         MACRO
*---------------------------------------------------------------------*
*
*  MACRO:      SRVCLRDB
*
*  TITLE:      Clear Debug Area
*
*  PURPOSE:    This macro is used to reset the debug stack pointed to
*              by the ESV.  It has no parameters.
*
*  SPECIAL     This macro is only intended for use by environment
*  NOTES:      support modules.  The same function is performed
*              by the CLRDEBUG option of the OS environment block
*              macro.  Environment support modules can not specify
*              this option because is has functions that process
*              the debug stack.
*
*  CHANGE
*  HISTORY:    05/13/87 MGG - NEW
*              01/10/91 MJM - Added code to check a flag in the ESV
*                             and skip resetting the debug stack if
*                             the flag is on.
*              06/01/06 MGG - Changed BNE to an IF for ARCHLVL=1.
