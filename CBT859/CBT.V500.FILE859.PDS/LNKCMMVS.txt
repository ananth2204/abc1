//* This job creates a composite module containing:                    *
//*    (1) Environment Support,                                        *
//*    (2) A standard module name table for &<SRVES>, and              *
//*    (3) The service processors referenced by the table.             *
//*                                                                    *
//* The composite load module will have an alias of the same name as   *
//* Environment Support so that when an application program loads      *
//* SRVESMVS it will get the composite module instead. The application *
//* program will never know the difference, except that fewer actual   *
//* LOADs may occur than would have otherwise.                         *
//*                                                                    *
//* Warning: Since the composite module has an alias of SRVESMVS, it   *
//*          obviously should not be placed in the same PDS as the     *
//*          real SRVESMVS load module.                                *
