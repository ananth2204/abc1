Service processors were created at Clemson University to assist in the
development and maintenance of assembly language programs.  They provide
an efficient, flexible, environment that can be used as a foundation for
constructing large and complex programs.  Service processors provide a
variety of functions, including most of those directly available to
programs written in high-level programming languages, and are designed
so that new functions can be added as needed.
:p.
In conjunction with the :hp3.Clemson University Structured Macros:ehp3.,
service processors bring assembler language programming to a level
approaching that of high-level programming languages.  However, their
use is not restricted to assembly language programs: any program written
in a language that supports standard System/370 calling conventions can
benefit from service processors.
:p.
The Clemson University Service Processors are packaged in a load library
and accompanying macro library.  The load library is accessed through
the system linklist or link pack area, so no :#x.STEPLIB:e#x. is
required for its use.  The macro library should be concatenated to the
assembler's :#x.SYSLIB:e#x. file, and requires Assembler H.
