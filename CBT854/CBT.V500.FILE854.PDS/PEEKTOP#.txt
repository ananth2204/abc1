       How to prepare and use 'peektop2'

1. When you open the program in the ISPF editor the first
   time, be sure to issue the command

    ===> caps off



2. I compiled and bound this as RENT into SCOMSTO.TR.PDSE.
   You can compile and bind into a reguler PDS also.


3. To test under ISPF option 6:

   ==> call 'scomsto.tr.pdse(peektop2)'

   should issue the prompts, read your reply, and
   display the first two lines of the file

   if you get a message like:

     CEE3501S The module PRINTF   was not found.

   then you will need to go back into the source and
   on the first line change 'dynam' to 'nodynam' and
   re-compile and bind



4. To run under the shell (your id must have been set
   up to have an omvs segment):

    a. from ISPF 6:

       ==> omvs convert((bpxfx437)) esc('^')


    b. the above puts you in your home directory; next, issue
       these commands:

       ==> mkdir demo
       ==> cd demo
       ==> touch peektop2
       ==> chmod 1755 peektop2
       ==> export STEPLIB=SCOMSTO.TR.PDSE (point to your
                                           library, of course)
       ==> peektop2


        Note: after you have done this once, you can
        run peektop2 just by reiussuing the last command - as
        long as you are in the same omvs session.

        If you exit omvs and then get back in later, you will
        need to issue these commands:


       ==> cd demo
       ==> export STEPLIB=SCOMSTO.TR.PDSE (your library)
       ==> peektop2
