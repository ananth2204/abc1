The datasets CBT489.FILE918 and CBT489.FILE919 are good to
go right now. They should be fully functional, not beta.

Here is some documentation and description.

This is a port of BASH 4.2, patch level 53, to the z/OS UNIX
environment. It should work substantially like it does on other
platforms. This includes all of the current patches, including the one
for the SHELLSHOCK exploit. Of course, this functionality only applies
to the BASH shell, and does not supply other GNU utilities such as GNU
grep, sed, gawk, and so on. This port was developed on z/OS 2.1 and
has been successfully tested on both z/OS 2.1 and 1.12. It may, or
may not, work on z/OS releases prior to 1.12. It does not have any
release dependent code it in, but it may have implicit dependencies in
Language Environment levels due to it being written in C. This port
does _NOT_ implement the "local spawn" functionality which the
standard /bin/sh shell for z/OS UNIX does. This means that the
_BPX_SHAREAS environment variable has no effect and there is no way to
share an address space with the shell process. This could have an
impact on performance and functionality of some UNIX commands and
shell scripts. This lack does not stop the sharing of an address space
by UNIX commands run under BASH. That is, the command can share its
(not BASH's) address space by use of the _BPX_SHAREAS and the spawn()
functionality. Assuming that said command is set up to do so. BASH
neither enables nor disables another command's ability in this
respect. One other possible "gotcha" is that many shell scripts start
with a line like: "#!/bin/sh". This is supported by BASH, but results
in the script running under the IBM supplied /bin/sh instead of under
BASH.

For FILE918,  only you might want to add another paragraph such as:

This software is licensed under the GPL. If you want the source, it is
available on this site in file #919.

For the FILE919 only, you might want to add another paragraph such as:

In compliance with the GPL license, the entire source has been
included in this distribution, along with the support files used to do
the configuration and compile of BASH. These reside in a PAX archive
which will need to be unwound into a UNIX directory. There is an
example job in the distributed PDS which can be customized to do this.

I just now did some minor editing of the README files.
