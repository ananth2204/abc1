         HELP MEMBER FOR LISTHEAD TSO COMMAND PROCESSOR
         ---- ------ --- -------- --- ------- ---------

)F FUNCTION -

    The LISTHEAD TSO command was written by Jeff Broido, with the
    purpose of finding out whether modules from the system, have
    standard headers.  In the "old days", before the greatly
    extended instruction set for z/OS, there were just a few
    standard ways for starting a module, and displaying a header
    for it, which would tell you which version of the module you
    have.  Now, there are a lot more ways of starting a module,
    and IBM has taken advantage of them.  Therefore, there are a
    lot more ways to create "IBM standard headers".

    Jeff's original program is kept here as member LISTHE01.

    LISTHEAD operates by doing a LOAD macro instruction, to attempt
    to load a module into your private storage.  Then it looks at
    the beginning of the module to determine if there is a standard
    header for it, in some standard IBM format.  The way Jeff wrote
    this program, if the header was not standard, the program would
    not display it.  I wanted to generalize the program so that all
    normal header information, "IBM standard" or not, would be
    displayed.

    So I added a display to show the first 300 bytes from the
    beginning of the module's storage, in any case, so you can see
    what's there.  If the format of the eyecatcher at the beginning
    is "somewhat standard", in other words, the program branches
    past it, and goes on to execute "real instructions", then I
    attempt to display the stuff that has been branched around,
    considering it as "header information".

    New instructions that can be used to start a module are BRC
    (Branch Relative on Condition - unconditional JUMP), and LARL
    (Load Address Relative Long).  IBM uses these to start a module
    VERY OFTEN nowadays.  So these are now looked for, by LISTHEAD.
    Also, BAS (Branch and Save) sometimes also occurs at the
    beginning of a module.

)X SYNTAX  -

    LISTHEAD modname  (operands)

)O OPERANDS -

    none (default)  -  Show everything

    ENTRY   -  Loads the module starting from the entry point

    NOHEX   -  Does not "hex display" the first 300 bytes at the
               beginning of the module.

    NOTITLE -  Does not display the title line saying which module
               was loaded.

Notes:

  Here is some sample output from this program.  The program now
   filters out most unprintable characters.

Sample Outputs:                         (extend to 100 bytes out)
