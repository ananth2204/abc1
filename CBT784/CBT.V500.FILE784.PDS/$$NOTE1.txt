This is another submission for you to look at. What this does is display
a Web page via IBM's HTTPD server on z/OS. The user can fill in a
dataset name or pattern as they would in ISPF option 3.4 and get a
response. The input and output from this function looks very similar to
ISPF option 3.4.

This PDS contains two REXX programs, an installation document, a
documentation document, an XMITted pax file, and a JCL file to help with
the installation.

I hope that I've gotten everything "ship shape" for distribution.
