//***FILE 784 is from John McKown and contains two implementations  *   FILE 784
//*           of a web page under z/OS Unix System Services which   *   FILE 784
//*           allow the user to obtain ISPF 3.4-like information    *   FILE 784
//*           about datasets.                                       *   FILE 784
//*                                                                 *   FILE 784
//*     Author : John A. McKown                                     *   FILE 784
//*     Email  : "McKown, John" <john.archie.mckown@GMAIL.com>      *   FILE 784
//*     Support: None guaranteed, but I would like "bug"            *   FILE 784
//*              reports.                                           *   FILE 784
//*                                                                 *   FILE 784
//*     This contains two different implementations of a Web        *   FILE 784
//*     page which allows a user to get data set information        *   FILE 784
//*     similar to ISPF option 3.4.                                 *   FILE 784
//*                                                                 *   FILE 784
//*     Both implementations use AJAX to update the Web page        *   FILE 784
//*     "in place".  The first is the simpler because the CGI       *   FILE 784
//*     actually creates the HTML for the Web page and the          *   FILE 784
//*     Javascript on the Web page simply puts that HTML on         *   FILE 784
//*     the page. The second is more complex in that the CGI        *   FILE 784
//*     actually creates the text form of a JSON object.  The       *   FILE 784
//*     Javascript on the Web page then initatiates this            *   FILE 784
//*     object which it uses to dynamically create the HTML to      *   FILE 784
//*     display. The second form is more powerful in that the       *   FILE 784
//*     JSON object can be used in other ways by other AJAX         *   FILE 784
//*     code.                                                       *   FILE 784
//*                                                                 *   FILE 784
