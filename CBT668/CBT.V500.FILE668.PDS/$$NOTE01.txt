Hi Sam,

I have created a package OFFLOAD to offload JES spool job output
to dataset level using SAPI.  It is used to offload the joblog in
our environment.

The features are:
1. The program can offload the spool data in JES OUTPUT queue
    into system catalogued datasets as following format.
    hlq.jobname.Ddate.jobid.TtimeIid

2. The spool data selection criteria can be given in EXEC PARM,
   which includes:

    * one or more output classes, maximum 36 classes
    * Submit USERID, support wildcards (* and ?)
    * Jobname, support wildcards (* and ?)
    * Output destination, support wildcards (* and ?)
    * Output form, support wildcards (* and ?)

3. Output dataset features:

    * Use VBA to remove trailing spaces, in order to save disk
      spaces.
    * Add message JOF700I at the beginning of each offloaded DD,
      in order to separate the DDs in job log.
    * Use higher level qualifier at the execution time, more
      flexible for different usage.
    * Spool data is offloaded when it's ready to offload in JES
      spool.

4. Operation features:

    * Provide logs in SYSPRINT DD with more meaningful
      information.
    * Support MVS system command STOP to stop the task. When the
      program is started in JCL batch, it must be stopped by MVS
      STOP command.

For example, PARM='H=LG.JOBLOG,C=8,J=@*' means offload all spool
data with output class 8 and job name started with @, the output
dataset HLQ is 'LG.JOBLOG'
