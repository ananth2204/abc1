Hello Sam,

When migrating from z/OS v1r13 to v2r1 the subject program
encounters problem with DYNALLOC output:

IGD17101I DATA SET ????????.????????.DATASET
NOT DEFINED BECAUSE DUPLICATE NAME EXISTS IN CATALOG
RETURN CODE IS 8 REASON CODE IS 38 IGG0CLEH

The problem will only surface if programs are recompiled at v2r1.
The load module from v1r13 will still work on v2r1 until
recompiled.

As a temporary fix, the program code can be changed as follows:

*        MVI    SSS2VER,SSS2CVER   Set version ß------ now a comment
         MVI    SSS2VER,SSS2VCTP   Set version, revert back to v2
*                                  ß---- now in effect to fix the bug.

This instruction is unique in the program and can easily be
located and fixed.

Best Regards,
Ed Tobias
