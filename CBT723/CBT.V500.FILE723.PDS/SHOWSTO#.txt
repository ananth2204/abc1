Sam,

The Assembler code is attached.  Note that this is for CA-IDMS
(DC only, no DB).  If you know the CICS macro-set, perhaps you
could convert this to run in CICS as well.

In the code, any macro (or DSECT) that begins with a # or @ sign
is a CA-IDMS macro.#GETSTG is like GETMAIN, #LINEOUT is straight
screen line mode (no BMS mapping, like REXX say), #FREESTG like
FREEMAIN and so on.  @MODE assembles non-executable code,
branched around.

All of the "MVS" stuff should be identical (PSA, ASCB,LDA, etc).

Also for CICS, in the comments at the front of the program,
substitute DFHRPL for CDMSLIB and PPT for "SYSGEN a program".
The Dynamic DCMT (think CEMT) thingies are just a temporary way
to get the program/task in place on-the-fly without bouncing the
region.

Does CICS have that too?

Have a whack at it.

Jim
