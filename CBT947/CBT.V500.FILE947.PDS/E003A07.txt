VSE/ESA - an early user experience - revisited

In issue 2 of VSE Update we published an article by Keith
Nush describing his experiences when installing VSE/ESA.  In
that article Keith said "Computer Associates is using ESA as an
excuse for increasing prices.  You now have to pay extra for an
ESA feature (for every product of theirs you have) that lets the
product work on VSE/ESA.  This is true even if you are
already leasing the product.  This ESA feature charge is costing
my company thousands of dollars.  Computer Associates is the
only company I know of that is doing this".

Computer Associates in the UK have written to say "all our
VSE products already support VSE/ESA.  All our VSE
products can run under VSE/ESA without payment of any
additional licence or maintenance fee.  We have developed for
certain of our VSE products chargeable, but optional, ESA
product modules that exploit the ESA extension of VSE".
