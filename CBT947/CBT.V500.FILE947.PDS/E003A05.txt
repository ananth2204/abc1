POWER commands from a program

The following program was originally developed to serve one
particular need, but is now widely used in our organization.
Our Data Centre's method for handling system usage
accounting of the batch VSE machine consists of collecting
data from the POWER job accounting file, merging it onto a
history tape, and then periodically (usually monthly) running a
report sorted by the USER field available in the POWER
accounting record.  (The EXEC we use for submitting a job
from VM ensures that the VM user-id is placed into the
POWER JOB card.)

The use of the POWER "PACCOUNT" ("J") command allowed
us to place the data onto tape, and the accounting information
was later deleted.  If, however, an unnoticed tape error
occurred, the operator could mistakenly erase the accounting
file, thus completely losing all of the data.

The COMMAND program allows the use of the EXEC card
PARM operand to pass an actual AR or POWER command to
the program, which in turn causes VSE to execute the
command just as if it had been entered at the console.  We
originally used the COMMAND program to automate the
deletion of the POWER accounting data based on the return
code from the previous job step.  Thus, no operator
intervention was needed and we prevented the possibility of
data loss.

Provision has been made in the program to accept commands
up to 50 characters in length.  If this is not sufficient for your
needs, simply increase the length of fields CMD and
PARMAREA equally.

Note that the PARM operand of the JCL EXEC statement
places the actual data at offset 2 from the address found in the
parameter list pointed to by register 1.  Thus, you will notice
that I incremented the register being used for the DSECT by 2.
