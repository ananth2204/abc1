Running CSP batch

We are a VSE/SP 3.2 shop using CSP/AD and CSP/AE for
developing on-line applications.  While we were satisfied with
CSP as an on-line development tool under CICS, we wanted to
explore the possibility of running CSP applications in VSE
batch partitions.  The ability to share record definitions and
code among on-line and batch applications eliminates
redundancy.  In addition, the batch applications can be
developed and tested on-line, using CSP/AD MSL and tracing
facilities.  Since most of our developers were already
conversant with CSP, using this language for batch applications
was attractive.

A CSP batch application is invoked by executing program
DCBYINIT.  The Application Load File (ALF) and application
name are specified in a control card (SYSIPT).  Applications
are fetched and executed from the ALF.  This is similar to the
way CSP/AE works under CICS.  Although no run statistics
are available, the performance of these batch programs has
been good.

The JCL might be challenging to some programmers because
of CSP's rather arcane control card syntax.  Here is an example
of a batch application using SQL/DS tables and VSAM
datasets.  The following points are noted:

o      Under CSP/AD, the application is defined as main batch.

o      This application was tested on-line under CSP/AD and then
      generated to an ALF.

o      Make sure that all VSAM datasets are shareable if the files
      are also used under CICS.

o      We use the standard label area for // DLBL definitions.
      This saves redundant JCL coding.
o      Follow the control statement syntax carefully (see CSP/AD
      and CSP/AE System Administration manual).

o      All naming conventions for on-line CSP apply.

o      An 8 byte field may be passed to the application
      (U=userparm).

o      All control statements must have ;; starting in column 71 if
      they are to be continued on the next card.

o      Note ';; END OF CSP PARAMETER DATA'.
