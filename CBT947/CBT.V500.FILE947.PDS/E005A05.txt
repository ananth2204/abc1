Unload magnetic tape drive for reuse

This routine allows a COBOL program to close a magnetic tape
file such that the tape is unloaded. This will allow the tape
drive to be used to read a number of tapes with the same
filename.

The routine must be called prior to the tape file being closed, eg:

CALL 'UNLOADTP' USING filename.
CLOSE filename.

Assemble the source code and catalogue the relocatable module
into a relocatable library. The relocatable library should be in
the standard relocatable library searchlist, so that the module
may be included in the calling program at link-edit time.
