VSE/ESA - an early user experience

My company's decision to install VSE/ESA was driven by the
need for more virtual storage.  With over 600 terminals and
printers, using two production CICS systems, VTAM was
pushing its VPBUF pool limits.  There was talk of putting
VTAM in a private address space on our existing VSE.  Since
we currently run on VSE/SP 3.1.2, this meant that we would
have to apply some PTFs and set up a CICS AOR and TOR.
There were concerns whether we could still process over 350
000 transactions per day and keep our current response times
without a CPU upgrade.  Luckily, VSE/ESA was announced
and made it unnecessary to use a CICS TOR.

We run on a 32MB 3090 with PR/SM using three LPARs.
LPAR A  is used for our production jobs and most of our
remote terminals and printers.  LPAR B is used for production
and by our programming staff.  LPAR C is used exclusively for
the system programming staff, consisting of two people.  There
are five 3480 tape drives attached to all three LPARs and one
3420 tape drive attached to LPARs A and B.

Our ESA tapes arrived in mid-January and we began installing
the tapes immediately.  After restoring DOSRES and
SYSWK1, we tried to IPL in ESA mode.  We found out that
you cannot IPL VSE/ESA in ESA mode in only 3MB of
memory as shipped by IBM.  There is a new parameter on the
SVA IPL statement: SHARED=LOW/HIGH.  This allows you
to put the SVA area right after the supervisor
(SHARED=LOW), or put it at the high end of storage
(SHARED=HIGH, which is where the SVA resides in pre-ESA
VSEs).  IBM ships VSE/ESA with SHARED=LOW.  We
could not IPL in ESA mode with less than 7MB of memory.
This meant we had to wait for the weekend, steal 4MB of
memory from another LPAR, IPL and get CICS up so we
could change the SVA statement to SHARED=HIGH, then
give the 4MB back to the LPAR we stole it from and re-IPL.
The minimum in which VSE/ESA in ESA mode could run is
3MB.  As you would expect, it does not run very fast, but
speed is not our main concern in our test environment.

The installation of VSE/ESA is the same as installing VSE/SP,
so I will not go into detail here.  The file layouts for DOSRES
and SYSWK1 have changed somewhat.  If you have used any
of the free space on the volumes for other files, you will need
to review those locations.

We decided to let our OEM packages test VSE/ESA for us.
During our testing, we found a couple of the VSE internal
changes that were made to make the new features work.  The
most widespread change was done to the partition's COMREG
area.  To support and run in the new dynamic partitions, new
full-word fields were added to the COMREG.  This means that
any program that uses half-word fields in the COMREG must
be changed to use the full-word field if running in a dynamic
partition.  If the program is only going to be run in a static
partition, no changes are needed to access the COMREG
fields.  Another change was made to some POWER control
blocks.  If you have a program that accesses POWER control
blocks, or bypasses POWER and reads the queue and data files
directly, these must be changed.

With the changes, any OEM products that use VSE or POWER
control blocks will need new versions.  This includes DASD
and tape management packages, schedulers, VSE monitors,
POWER queue files to CICS printer packages, VSAM dynamic
buffering packages, and SORT packages.  You should call the
vendor and make sure that their product will work under ESA
and with what kind of restrictions, if any.  The reason I
mentioned the restrictions is explained below.

The following is a list of packages that we are testing/running
under ESA:

o      Computer Associates      -      DYNAM
o      Computer Associates      -      SORT
o      Computer Associates      -      SCHEDULER
o      Computer Associates      -      VOLLIE
o      Computer Associates      -      LIBRARIAN
o      Computer Associates      -      RAPS
o      Pansophic      -       CORPORATE TIE
o      Pansophic      -       EASYTRIEVE PLUS
o      Goal      -      EXPLORE/VSE
o      SDS      -       POWERTOOLS.

CA-DYNAM - Version 5.5 of the DYNAM family is needed.
Most of the serious problems that we encountered were caused
by IBM code.  All were fixed by existing PTFs.  DYNAM has
no problems running in a dynamic partition.

CA-SORT - Version 7.4 is needed to run under ESA.  CA-
SORT will run in a dynamic partition.  There were no new
features besides the capability to run under ESA.

CA-SCHEDULER - Version 7.2 is needed to run under ESA.
There are some new features for coordinating job runs on other
CPUs.  You must make sure you re-link the phases that access
JCL from other library types (ie VOLLIE, LIBRARIAN,
ICCF, CONDOR).  These other packages have new ESA
modules that need to be included when link-editing CA-
SCHEDULER.  So make sure these packages are already
installed.

CA-VOLLIE - VOLLIE is still at Version 4.3.  However, you
need to order an ESA option tape that will allow VOLLIE to
work under ESA.  This tape contains the object code and
phases needed for ESA.

CA-LIBRARIAN - LIBRARIAN is still at 3.8.  It also needs
an ESA option tape to function under VSE/ESA.

CA-RAPS - Version 4.2 of RAPS is needed.  It needs the ESA
option tape to run under VSE/ESA.

Pansophic's Easytrieve Plus - Version 6.0.D will run under
ESA in static partitions only.  It will not run in a dynamic
partition.  I asked Pansophic about their plans for enhancing
Easytrieve Plus to run in a dynamic partition.  They said there
were no immediate plans for providing this capability.  Also,
Easytrieve Plus cannot run under ESA if the SVA is set up as
SHARED=LOW.  Easytrieve checks some addresses to
determine whether it may be run in the SVA.  If the SVA is set
up as SHARED=LOW, Easytrieve will display a message then
cancel.  The SVA must be set up as SHARED=HIGH in order
for Easytrieve Plus to run.

Pansophic's CORPORATE TIE - Version 2 was tested, and we
found no problems running under ESA with CICS 2.1.

Goal's EXPLORE/VSE - We are new to using
EXPLORE/VSE.  Under VSE/SP, we ran IBM Performance
Tool to monitor our VSEs.  IBM has announced that PT will
not run under ESA and has no plans to make it run under ESA.
IBM advised that we try EXPLORE/VSE.  So we installed
EXPLORE/VSE and gave it a try.  We were pleased with what
EXPLORE could do.  I have been told by Goal that the disk
XA I/O reporting was new.  They can take the actual timings
from the hardware and not depend on sampling to get their
numbers.  If you are looking for a VSE monitor, make sure
you take a look at EXPLORE/VSE.

SDS POWERTOOLS - The most current version available will
work under ESA.

During the testing of these products, we did encounter some
bugs.  Some were the vendor's code, some were ESA code.
Some of the problems went away after we applied the PTFs
from the PSP PUT buckets.  It is very important to apply the
PTFs from the bucket list.  These solved some of the serious
errors between the OEM packages and ESA.  I would also
recheck the buckets every few weeks.  ESA is new, and new
PTFs appear in the buckets.

One area our OEM products could not test was in the
communications area.  We have a 3745 running NCP Version
5.3.  VTAM 3.3 had no problems communicating with the
3745.  We tested remote SNA terminals and printers, POWER
RJE, POWER PNET, VTAM cross domains, and the dial-up
connection to an EDI network.

One IBM product that is a disappointment is FCOBOL, which
will not compile in a dynamic partition.  We were planning to
set up a dynamic class for compiles and testing.  Since neither
FCOBOL nor EASYTRIEVE PLUS will compile in a dynamic
partition, dynamic partitions do not give us any benefits.

Pricing of VSE/ESA depends on what type of CPU it is
running on.  Generally speaking, there is a big increase in the
monthly cost going from VSE/SP 3.1.2 to VSE/ESA.  I am
told that going from VSE/SP 4.1 to VSE/ESA is not as big an
increase.  Computer Associates is using ESA as an excuse for
increasing prices.  You now have to pay extra for an ESA
feature (for every product of theirs you have) that lets the
product work on VSE/ESA.  This is true even if you are
already leasing the product.  This ESA feature charge is costing
my company thousands of dollars.  Computer Associates is the
only company I know of that is doing this.  We are considering
the possibility of dropping Computer Associates' products and
replacing them with products from companies who do not
charge extra for VSE/ESA.

Our target date for moving VSE/ESA into production is the
middle of March.  All of our OEM ESA versions can run in
VSE/SP.  So we are moving each product into production
under VSE/SP before we convert to VSE/ESA.  This will serve
two purposes.  One, it will make converting to ESA easier.
Two, it will give us a chance to stress test the new versions and
find any problems before we move to VSE/ESA.

VSE/ESA has given us room for growth by putting VTAM in
its own address space.  This should last us for about 2 years.
By that time, IBM should have announced the availability of
31-bit virtual addressing.
