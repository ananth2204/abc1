How to obtain volume characteristics information

It may often be useful for a program to provide information
about DASD characteristics or actual DASD status.  For
example, it may be useful to know a DASD device type;
whether it is shareable; the VTOC start address; the track
balance information (number of remaining data bytes on a
track); and so on.  This, and other useful information related to
DASD (and also tape) devices, can easily be obtained by
calling the macro GETVCE (SVC99, X'63') from an Assembler
routine.

A simple application might consist of a test from a batch
program to check whether a specific DASD VOLSER exists
and is operational.  (This is similar to the information obtained
with AR command VOLUME.)  For example, it is possible, at
an unattended site, to verify from a batch program whether a
specific VOLSER is used and operational, and to set a return
code to be tested with conditional JCL for a possible skip of a
//ASSGN STMT, that would otherwise get the message 1A67D
UNIT CURRENTLY UNASSIGNABLE.

The return codes from this macro are well explained in the
VSE Messages manual (page VSE-13 of SC33-6310 for
VSE/SP 3.1), but only in the Supervisor Program Logic
Manual is it possible to find out how to code it.  The simple
routine shown here shows only how to code the macro with the
VOLID parameter, and the possible return code that GETVCE
returns in register 15.  It is not a complete program.  A detailed
explanation of all the parameters may be found in the
Supervisor Logic Manual.  A DSECT of the information
returned from GETVCE in the program area addressed by the
AREA parameter may be found in the Supervisor assembly
listing (AVRADR DSECT).
