CPU-ids for VSE

We run several VSE virtual machines in our VM/VSE
environment, each with its own purpose and CPU-id.  Among
these are virtual machines running test CICS, development
batch, production CICS, production batch, and VSE pre-
upgrade test.  The start-up IPL parameters for the different
virtual machines are in a VSE procedure called the ASIPROC
(automatic system initialization procedure).

Since we run VM on two mainframe systems, each logical
VSE system has a virtual machine defined in both VM
directories.  The logical systems are known to the users in the
installation by their user-ids, which are linked to the use of the
virtual machine.  The correct ASIPROC entry for each machine
is decided by the CPU-id of the machine performing the IPL.

The CPU-id is composed of four fields:

o      Version code (always 'FF' under VM)

o      Serial number (can be set by directory option or CP SET command)

o      Model number (under VM, same as the base hardware)

o      Channel logout (under VM, always 0).

At start-up, a VSE machine does a store CPU-id operation to
get its CPU-id, and locate its entry in the ASIPROC.
Unfortunately, when the virtual machine runs on a different
physical system, its CPU-id will not be the same in the 'CPU
model' field, if the base hardware is a different model.  This
results in two major and one minor problem:

1      VSAM files defined with a file-id in the format
      %%SOMENAME are used to provide partition and CPU
      independence of file-id.  (The same user name
      SOMENAME can be used by jobs in different partitions
      and CPUs.)  The file-id built by VSAM consists of the
      user-supplied name (SOMENAME) with the CPU serial
      and model numbers appended to it.  A problem arises if a
      file is built in a particular CPU and partition, by a logical
      VSE which then moves to a different VM system.  For
      example, if a job builds file %%MYFIL while in F5 of
      PRODBAT, it gets a real file-id of
      MYFIL.F5.C222222.M3033.  If PRODBAT is stopped,
      and restarted on the other VM system, on a real 4341, the
      F5 job looking for file %%MYFIL will fail, as it needs to
      find MYFIL.F5.C222222.M4341.

2      VSE does not recognize the label area previously created,
      if the current CPU-id has a model number different from
      that in the original CPU-id.  This requires the label area to
      be reformatted at IPL when restarting the same logical
      VSE system on the other real CPU.

3      A minor annoyance is the need to build multiple ASIPROC
      entries for each logical VSE, with the same CPU serial
      number but different model numbers.  One entry for each
      model in the installation is needed for each CPU serial
      number used.  Entries must also be added if hardware is
      acquired with a model number not yet in use.

To solve these problems, and to ensure that logical VSE
machines will have a fixed CPU-id, without being affected by
the hardware model the virtual machine is running on, I
installed the following mod to CP.

A virtual machine can get its CPU-id in two ways, either by a
CP query (as a CMS user would do), or with the STIDP (store
CPU-id) machine instruction (which is what a VSE machine
does).  Since STIDP is a privileged instruction, it is caught and
simulated by VM.  The mod, in DMKPRV simply says: all
users performing a STIDP instruction will be given the same
CPU model number, regardless of the real hardware model.
(The CP QUERY CPUID command is unaffected by this mod.)
In this way, each of our VSE machines gets its standard

CPU-id, without being affected by the real machine in use.
The CPU model is always 4341, since that was one of the
models in use here when I wrote the mod, but this can be
whatever CPU model type you want.

The lines are inserted following 'MVC

label MAINMODL in the IBM source.

After the first part of this article was written we installed a new
CPU of the 3081 class, which for the first time required an
IOCP generation.  After setting up a basic IOCP definition
through the hardware frames, and IPLing VM, I attempted to
store the full IOCP which I had built in a CMS file.  Even
though Q CPUID displayed FFnnnnnn30810000 (nnnnnn being
the CPU serial number), I received the error message: ICP400I
READ/WRITE OF IOCDS IS INVALID ON THIS
PROCESSOR.

I immediately guessed that the IOCP program was checking the
CPU-id with STIDP, and verified this by running IOCP with
CP PER (PER I B202 R 20000-30000).  When PER caught the
STIDP operation (twice) I replaced the model number using CP
STORE.  This temporary measure at least allowed the IOCP to
finish normally.

We now decided that all references to 4341 in the CP mod
would be changed to 3081, to prevent this IOCP problem in the
future.  This entailed the following steps:

1      One VSE machine was started (still using the old CP mod,
      with 4341 as the CPU model).

2      The ASIPROC entries were recatalogued with 3081 in the

      CPU-id of the test batch VSE machine.

3      The CP mod was edited, DMKPRV reassembled, and the
      CP nucleus was rebuilt.

4      On start-up of the VSE test batch system, the lock file had
      to be reformatted, to remove all the old CPUs (with 4341)
      already recorded in it.

5      The label area got an 'OVERLAP ON UNEXPIRED FILE'
      message, and needed to be given a DELETE, since the file
      was under the name of a CPU of type 4341.

6      Other software, which recognized systems by CPU-id, had
      to be given the new CPU-ids to use.  These included
      ZEKE (scheduling system) and DYNAM/T (tape
      management system).

7      Now that at least one system was up and running with
      3081, all ASIPROC entries were changed and the other
      VSE systems could be started.  Each system required a
      DELETE of the old label area at the first VSE IPL.

The new version of the mod is given below.
