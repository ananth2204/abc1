Loading tables in VSE batch

Though CICS allows the dynamic loading of a phase into
storage from a high-level language program, batch VSE has
never offered this capability.

In our installation, numerous tables - eg postage and foreign
country and zip code tables - are used in programs.  To ensure
that changes made to these tables are always reflected in the
programs which access them, without the need for re-
compilation and without 'hard-coding' them, we developed the
TABLOADR program.

TABLOADR is designed to be called from a high-level
language (such as COBOL or PL/I), and issues a VSE LOAD
macro to accomplish the actual function.

When invoked from a COBOL program, for instance, the
CALL statement must pass two parameters: the data name of
where the phase is to be loaded into storage, and a data name
containing a value corresponding to the phase name which is to
be loaded, as in the following sample code:

01  W06-POSTAGE-AREA.
    03      W06-PHASE-NAME           PIC  X(08) VALUE 'POSTAGE '.
    03      W06-POSTAGE-TABLE.
        ---   actual layout of data   ---
    SKIP3
01  W07-FOREIGN-COUNTRY-AREA.
    03      W07-PHASE-NAME           PIC X(08)  VALUE 'FOREIGNS'.
    SKIP1
    03      W07-FOREIGN-COUNTRY-TABLE.
        ---   actual layout of data   ---
        SKIP3
        ---    PROCEDURE DIVISION statements   ---

    CALL 'LOADIT' USING W06-PHASE-NAME W06-POSTAGE-TABLE.
    CALL 'LOADIT' USING W07-PHASE-NAME W07-FOREIGN-COUNTRY-TABLE.

When invoked from a BAL program, standard linkage
convention is used.  Register 1 points to a parameter list
containing the address where the data is to be loaded and the
address of the field containing the phase name to be loaded.

The tables themselves are created by placing the values desired
in DCs in a BAL program.  The BAL program is then
assembled and link-edited.
