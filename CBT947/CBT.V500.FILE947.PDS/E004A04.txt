How to share ICCF in several VSE/SP4 systems


SITUATION

We run VM/XA on a 3090.  We had VSE/SP4 running under
VM/XA, installed as intended by IBM.  We needed eight more
VSE systems; five in VAE-mode and three in VM-mode.  All
eight systems had to share the two system mini-disks DOSRES
and SYSWK1.

Our users needed a CICS with ICCF in each machine, and to
save as much DASD space as possible, I had to share the CICS
and ICCF system generated in the installation, automatically,
between all machines.


WHAT I DID

Using the main system, I defined a new VSAM user catalog on
an extra mini-disk for the first system.  (Main system means
the original generated system; first system means the first extra
generated system.  The remaining seven systems are not
mentioned, because I simply repeated the method.)

This mini-disk was created especially for this purpose with a
size of 50 cylinders, including catalog and space.  (This size
was an assumption; I was unfortunately unable to find out the
minimum VSAM-size a shared CICS needs.)

I changed the standard label procedure of the first system so
that the following files came under the control of this new user
catalog:

IJSYSLN, IESCNTL, IESTRFL, IESTRWF, IESMSGS,
IESPRB, IESROUT, DFHSTM, DFHSTN, DFHNTRA,
DFHTEMP, DFHRSD, IJSYS01-04, SORTWK1, and
IKSYS11-54.

DFHDMPA, DFHDMPB, and DFHAUXT stayed in
VSESPUC with separate names.

I duplicated the procedure DTRCICST and called it
DTRCICS2 and catalogued DTRCICS2.PROC in SYSLIB.
(This procedure is called in the CICS start-up, therefore I had
to change the start-up procedure for the first CICS system so
that DTRCICS2.PROC was called.)

I duplicated the % sign for all the workfiles.

I IPLed the first system and then worked in this system and:

o      Defined and initialized the RSD file,

o      Defined and initialized the TEXT - REPSTORY file,

o      Defined the TD - INTRA file,

o      Defined the DFHTEMP file,

o      Defined the MESSAGE - ROUTING file,

o      Defined the ONLINE - PROB - DET file,

o      Defined the AUTO - STATS - A file,

o      Defined the AUTO - STATS - B file,

o      Defined the SYSTEM - LOG - A file,

o      Defined the SYSTEM - LOG - B file,

o      Defined the USER - JOURNAL - A file,

o      Defined the USER - JOURNAL - B file.

I backed up the DTSFILE from the ICCF-library of the main
system and restored it to the ICCF-library of the first system.

I backed up the VSE CONTROL file from VSESPUC and
restored it to the new user catalog.

I backed up the TEXT REPSTORY file from VSESPUC and
restored it to the new user catalog.

I defined DEFAULT - MODEL - ESDS - SAM in the new user
catalog.

I initialized the DUMP MANAGEMENT FILE in the first
system.

I started CICS-ICCF in the first system and logged on.

I changed the name of the standard-label procedure in the
member ADM$DTAB in library '50' in the newly-created
CICS-ICCF to the name used by the first system.
