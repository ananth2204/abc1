Reader's letter

We recently used a combination of two articles in the June
1991 issue of VSE Update. The articles were VSE batch
operator and Partition wait for a specified time. These two
articles saved our company a lot of time and money.

Using the two articles, we programmed an automatic operator
to bounce our system from night-production CICS to day-
production CICS every morning at 5:30am before the day
operators reported at 6:00am.

Other systems programmers with the same limited experience
may benefit from an additional note being added to the
Partition wait for a specified time article. The SETIME macro
will only allow a maximum wait time of 55924 seconds (15
hours 32 minutes and 4 seconds). This caused us several
headaches until we determined the problem.
