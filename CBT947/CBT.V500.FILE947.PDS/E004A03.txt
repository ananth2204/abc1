PR/SM versus VM for VSE users

For sites that have a 3090 or ES/9000 processor the PR/SM
feature is available.  By using PR/SM, VSE sites can run VSE
native on the hardware without needing  VM to run as a
hypervisor.  Many VSE sites are in the position of having to
choose whether or not to keep VM.

There are a number of benefits from removing VM completely
and using the PR/SM feature.  Savings in costs can be made
because payments for VM and related software licence fees no
longer have to be made.  However, sites with processors that
require PR/SM to be paid for as an optional extra will have to
compare the two costs carefully.  There are performance
improvements in VSE from using PR/SM rather than VM.
PR/SM allows VSE to achieve near native performance levels,
whereas with VM, VSE's performance is at best in the 90%
region of native performance.  PR/SM has much less of an
overhead than VM.  The PR/SM overhead has been measured
at around 2%, while the VM overhead has been measured at
anything between 8% and 25%.  PR/SM offers improved
reliability over VM.  Although VM is very stable it does
sometimes crash, whereas PR/SM is not known to crash.

On the downside, the loss of VM has associated drawbacks.
VM allows a great deal of flexibility when it comes to sharing
devices between several guest VSE systems.  This is achieved
with the ATTACH command.  VM can even allocate the
individual device address on the same control unit to separate
guest systems.  PR/SM does not offer anywhere near this
degree of flexibility, requiring a separate control unit per guest.
If a device does not have multiple channel connections it can
be attached to only one PR/SM guest.  With VM, guest
systems can communicate with each other easily using a virtual
CTCA.  With PR/SM it is much more complicated.  PR/SM
guests can communicate, but need real CTCAs or
communication hardware, eg 3745 with multiple channel
adapters.  VM is much better at allocating memory to guests
than PR/SM.  Guests under VM get memory from a common
pool which results in optimum real storage utilization.  With
PR/SM, the memory is allocated to a guest on a once and for
all basis.  Unused memory from one PR/SM guest cannot be
used by another PR/SM guest.  Perhaps the biggest negative
aspect of losing VM is the loss of CMS.  Neither VSE nor
PR/SM offer such a multifunctional user-friendly facility.

When deciding one way or another, VSE sites will have to give
their own weighting to each of the plus and minus points for
PR/SM and VM and see which of the two choices comes out
top.
