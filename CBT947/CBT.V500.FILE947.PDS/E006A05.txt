CICS commands from batch

The following Assembler source code allows any program to
feed a character string to the system console as if it were keyed
to the DOC handler in VSE/SP 2.1.7. I suspect it will function
on any Version 2 VSE supervisor.

I wrote this for a client installation so they could CLOSE and
OPEN CICS datasets from a batch partition during update runs
under the control of the batch program.

The client leaves a Terminal Control read outstanding at the
system console all the time, and this routine and the batch
program are able to issue a CEMT CLOSE or OPEN when
necessary.

One address, the system PSS, must be obtained from a
supervisor Assembly listing.
