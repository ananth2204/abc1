PF key support for VSE console

We are running VSE/SP 3.2.2 and I have noticed that IBM has
some undocumented supervisor commands, which may be
interesting for every VSE system programmer, but take care
when using these commands for the first time!  I have found
these commands and the parameters by trial and error and they
might not be complete.

These commands are: DEBUG, GETVIS, LOCATE, PFKEY,
PRTYIO, SHOW, STACK, STATUS and TAPE.

PFKEY and STACK are very nice, because now you have the
features you always wanted: ie retrieve key on VSE, and create
short names for long commands.  It is an IBM solution which
does not require changes in object code.


PFKEY

Format of command:

      PFKEY (ON PF10)

It is not standard to have a retrieve key for the VSE console.  If
a long command has been entered at the console and it contains
an error, the whole command must be rekeyed.  With this
command you can activate PF key support for VSE on PF10,
although you could use any key you wanted.

To activate this support you have to reassemble your supervisor
with the following undocumented options:

o      FOPT  - PARAMETER: DEBUG=YES
o      IOTAB -PARAMETER: DEBUG=4K

Example supervisor generation

SUPRV ID=T,                     SUPERVISOR $$A$SUPT                C
      MODE=370,                 MODE 370                           C
      NPARTS=9                  9 PARTITIONS
FOPT  DASDSHR=NO,               NO DASD SHARING                    C
      DEBUG=YES,        <---    DEBUG ON FOR PF-KEYS               C
      FASTTR=YES,               FAST CCW TRANSLATION               C
      RPS=YES,                  ROT. POS. SENS. ON                 C
      USERID='SUPRV.WITH.PFKEY' SUPERVISOR IDENTIFIER MESSAGE
IOTAB NPGR=2295,                255 X 9 PROG. LOG. UNITS           C
      DEBUG=4K,         <---    4K DEBUGGING AREA FOR PF-KEYS      C
      IODEV=254                 MAX I/O DEV.

If you do not have the debug option on, message "1I01I
INVALID COMMAND" will appear.

The major disadvantage of these definitions is a little
performance degradation (I think about 1 percent).

You must change and catalogue the IPL procedure to use the
new supervisor.

      01F,$$A$SUPT,VSIZE=40M,VIO=512K,VPOOL=64K,N,NOLOG

Next a VSE IPL must be performed.  Once the system is up the
following commands must be entered:

      DEBUG
      PFKEY ON PF10

This will ensure that the debug option is on and set the retrieve
key on PF10.

To test the retrieve key function you can adopt the following
procedure.  Type in MAP; MAP output is shown.  Press PF10;
MAP command is shown again.  Press the enter key and the
MAP output is reshown.

The set up works with VSE/SP 3.3.2.


STACK

Format of command:

      STACK short!command

With this command you can shorten every command for
POWER, VTAM or OCCF!  Your operator will be astonished
if you type in 'VB' and on the VSE console comes the VTAM
buffer statistic or you display the POWER queue by typing in
'PD'.  For example:

      VB!D NET,BFRUSE

Command 'VB' will show you VTAM buffer statistic.

Note: no blank characters should be between the short name
and the command; the separator should be an exclamation mark.


DEBUG

Format of command:

      DEBUG (on | off)

DEBUG without parameter shows actual debug status.
DEBUG ON activates IBM internal supervisor debug mode.
DEBUG OFF deactivates IBM internal supervisor debug mode.


GETVIS

Format of command:

      GETVIS (PARTITION)

Displays GETVIS statistic of an active partition


LOCATE

Format of command:

      LOCATE ' SEARCH-STRING '

This will locate a string in storage from 00000 to FFFFFF.

Every occurrence is shown with AR+15, and you must answer
with '15'.  '15 END' stops locating.  For example:

      LOCATE 'POWER'


PRTYIO

Format of command:

      PRTYIO (OFF|PARTITION)

This works like the PRTY command.

With this command you can favour I/Os for special partitions.
For example:

      PRTYIO F2,F3


SHOW

Format of command:

      SHOW ADR.LEN

Shows storage on address 'ADR' in length of 'LEN'.  For
example:

      SHOW 000001.0F


STATUS

Format of command:

      STATUS (iodev)

Displays status of all subtasks in a partition or for an I/O
device.  For example:

      STATUS 00E


TAPE

Format of command:

      TAPE (run=off,unl=unl)
'
TAPE ' without operands shows tape status.
'TAPE ' with operands changes tape's status.  For example:

      TAPE RUN=ON
