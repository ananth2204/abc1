LLCBAVAL EQU   X'80'                   The LLA search services are
*                                      available. LLCBAVAL is turned on
*                                      by LLA directory build to
*                                      activate a new directory. It is
*                                      initially off, and LLA turns it
*                                      off when it terminates.
*                                      LLA's recovery exit CSVLLESCH
*                                      and BLDL's ESTAE IGCT0018 turn
