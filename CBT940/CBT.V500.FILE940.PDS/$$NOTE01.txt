             Notes on the LLAPRINT program
             ----- -- --- -------- -------

This is a program to list the libraries that LLA controls.

The original author of this program was M. Schmidt from
Switzerland.  The program came to me through Gilbert Saint-flour,
after I looked in his libraries.

It is an old program, but it uses an undocumented IBM interface,
so therefore it must be customized for the z/OS or OS/390
operating system release.  Currently it was tested on z/OS 2.2.

The program as written, has two parts, LLAPRINT and LLASAC.
Both have to be APF authorized.  LLAPRINT does a LOAD for LLASAC.
In the current packaging, the two programs have to be assembled
separately.  You execute LLAPRINT, and it loads LLASAC to do its
"heavy work".

One "kludgey" part of the program, which depends on the level of
the operating system, is the undocumented extension to the IHALLCB
macro, which describes the extension to the LLCB control block.

Another "level-dependent" part of the program is the format of
the LLDS dsect.  This dsect apparently changes, and has a "type"
level to determine its format.

I added 7 extra fullwords to account for the additions to
the LLDS header, apparently between version 1 and version 2.
You can see the LLDS format inside the LLASAC source code.



               Installation Instructions
               ------------ ------------

You need to do assembly of the two source programs, into an
APF-authorized load library.  Assemble both programs using the
two jobs:  ASLLAPRT, and ASLLASAC.

Run the program, once it is installed, using job:  RUNPRINT
as a model.
