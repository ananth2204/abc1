WHY WAS IT WRITTEN?

THESE PROGRAMS ALLOW AN INSTALLATION TO DEINSTALL THE CA/OPTIMIZER
PRODUCT WITHOUT THE NEED TO RE-COMPILE ANY COBOL PROGRAM THAT WAS
PREVIOUSLLY COMPILED WITH OPTIMIZATION.

HOW DOES IT WORK?

A PAIR OF USER WRITTEN STUB PROGRAMS GET CONTROL WHENEVER AN
OPTIMIZED PROGAM ATTEMPTS TO LINK TO THE CA/OPTIMIZER RUNTIME
COMPONENT.

THREE STEP PROCESS

1) DURING SUBSYSTEM INITIALIZATION, PROGRAM ANCHOR BUILDS THE
   INSTALLATION COMUNICATIONS VECTOR TABLE IN ECSA AND LOADS
   THE ADDRESS OF STUB MODULE #2 IN ITS ASSIGNED TABLE ENTRY.
2) STUB MODULE #1 TAKES THE PLACE OF CA'S CACEMCKI PROGRAM. THIS
   FIRST STUB MODULE MODIFIES THE OPTIMIZED WITH NOOP INSTRUCTIONS
   SO IT'S NEVER LINKED TO AGAIN. THIS FIRST STUB PROGRAM THEN
   RUNS THE CONTROL BLOCK CHAIN TO THE INSTALLATION COMUNICATIONS
   VECTOR TABLE AND BRANCHES TO STUB MODULE #2.
3) STUB MODULE #2 DELETES STUB MODULE #1 AND RETURNS TO THE ORIGINAL
   OPTIMIZED PROGRAM.

HOW TO IMPLEMENT

CONTACT PETER RELSON, RELSON@US.IBM.COM FOR YOUR OWN OFFSET IN THE
CUSTOMER ANCHOR TABLE. ONCE YOU HAVE RECEIVED YOUR ASSIGNED VALUE
MODIFY THE CONSTANT AT THE 'CHANGEME' LABEL IN PROGRAMS ANCHOR AND
CACEMCKI.

PROGRAMS ANCHOR AND CACEMCKI SHOULD BE INSTALLED INTO A LINKLIST
LIBRARY. THE USRANC01 PROGRAM SHOULD BE INSTALLED INTO LPA.

ADD THE CONTENTS OF MEMBER IEFSSNXX TO YOUR OWN IEFSSNXX MEMBER AND
EITHER IPL OR PERFORM DYNAMIC SYSTEM CHANGES TO ENABLE THE FUNCTION
PROVIDED BY THESE PROGRAMS.

PERFORMANCE CONSIDERATIONS

THERE WAS SOME INITIAL CONCERN THAT THERE MIGHT BE A PERFORMANCE HIT
AFTER THE CA/OPTIMIZER RUNTIME ENVIRONMENT WAS REMOVED FROM THE
SYSTEM, BUT NO SIGNIFICENT DIFFERENCE WAS SEEN, YMMV HOWEVER.
