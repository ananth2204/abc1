 A possible address off the Customer Anchor Table, X'CC' off the ECVT,
 could be X'228' (assigned to a particular customer by IBM, but this
 is an example address).

 This is just an example.  For your site, you have to ask IBM to
 assign this address for your site, and they are obligated to do so,
 for a CUSTOMER.  Besides the fullwords that are assigned for VENDORS,
 there are also four fullwords that are assignable to customers, if
 they need a permanent address in the system to anchor some function.

 At the time of this writing, Peter Relson of IBM is in charge of
 assigning these addresses to either vendors or customers.

 You are obligated to make sure that no program or product at your
 site is already using this address.
