 FINDALL  - REXX EXEC to scan the user's ISPLLIB, STEPLIB, the
            LPALIST, the LINKLIST, the user's SYSPROC, and SYSEXEC
            concatenations for the specified member.  Calling
            sequence:
                    FINDALL member {listtype}
                            member is the program command CLIST or
                                   REXX to be located
                            listtype is either the word SHORT
                                     (default) or LONG.  SHORT will
                                     display only the library
                                     containing an instance of
                                     member.  LONG will display the
                                     entire list with the the status
                                     from SYSDSN.

 FINDPAN  - REXX EXEC to scan the user's ISPPLIB concatenation for
            the specified ISPF panel.  The calling sequence is the
            same as for FINDALL.

 FINDPARM - REXX EXEC to scan the system PARMLIB concatenation for
            the specified parm member.  The parmlib concatenation is
            built from the information stored in the IPA during IPL.
            The calling sequence is the same as for FINDALL.

 FINDPROC - REXX EXEC to scan the JES2 PROCLIB concatenation(s) for
            the specified PROC. The proclib concatenation must be
            built manually from the JES2 JCL since I was too lazy to
            write code to go cross memory to JES2 to get it from the
            $HCT.  (If anyone has some code to do this, please feel
            free to share it with me and I will incorporate it into
            the EXEC.)The calling sequence is the same as for
            FINDALL.

 #FINDLPA - REXX EXEC subroutine to extract the LPALST dataset names
            from the LPAT.  The LPA libraries are not allocated
            except as might occur for SYSDSN processing.  The EXEC
            is written so as to function as either a subroutine or
            as a main program.  If invoked as a main program, it
            will stop at the first occurrence of the target member
            and ask if the user wants to continue scanning the rest
            of the LPALST libraries.  The calling sequence is the
            same as for FINDALL.

 #FINDMOD - REXX EXEC subroutine to extract the LINKLIST dataset
            names from the caller's Link List Set.  The Link List
            libraries are not allocated except as might occur for
            SYSDSN processing.  The EXEC is written so as to
            function as either a subroutine or as a main program.
            If invoked as a main program, it will stop at the first
            occurrence of the target member and ask if the user
            wants to continue scanning the rest of the LPALST
            libraries.  The calling sequence is the same as for
            FINDALL.

 #GENFIND - REXX EXEC subroutine to scan the output of LISTA STA to
            find the target DDName concatenation and then to scan
            for the target member.  Calling sequence:
                   #GENFIND ddname member {listtype}
                            ddname is the target concatenation
                            member is the element to be located
                            listtype is either the word SHORT
                                     (default) or LONG.  SHORT will
                                     display only the library
                                     containing an instance of
                                     member.  LONG will display the
                                     entire list with the the status
                                     from SYSDSN.

 #SYSID   - REXX EXEC subroutine extract the System name from
            CVTSNAME.  If called as subroutine, it will simply
            return the system name.  If called as a standalone
            commands is will display it.  There are no parms in the
            calling sequence
