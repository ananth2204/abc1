//***FILE 734 is the original version of the PDS command, which     *   FILE 734
//*           still works, but which is being included here for     *   FILE 734
//*           nostalgia only.  The version of PDS on File 182,      *   FILE 734
//*           having been improved for so many years by Bruce       *   FILE 734
//*           Leland, Steve Smith, and John Kalinich, is so much    *   FILE 734
//*           better (and it now has PDSE support from Greg Price)  *   FILE 734
//*           that you shouldn't even THINK of using this version.  *   FILE 734
//*                                                                 *   FILE 734
//*           However, this is the version that I used to use on    *   FILE 734
//*           MVT, and it brings back very pleasant memories of     *   FILE 734
//*           a time gone by.  Try it and dream of the old days,    *   FILE 734
//*           way, way before any programmers ever got laid off     *   FILE 734
//*           (and way before any IBM'ers got laid off either).     *   FILE 734
//*                                                                 *   FILE 734
//*           Think 1975 !!!                                        *   FILE 734
//*                                                                 *   FILE 734
//*           But in a pinch, this program, renamed PDSORIG to      *   FILE 734
//*           avoid conflicts with any later and better versions,   *   FILE 734
//*           still works, and can still bail you out.  It is a     *   FILE 734
//*           tribute to the longevity of the old OS/360 design.    *   FILE 734
//*                                                                 *   FILE 734
//*           All the best to all of you ......                     *   FILE 734
//*                                                                 *   FILE 734
