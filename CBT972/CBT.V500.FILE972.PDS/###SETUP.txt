GENIE.PDS(###SETUP)

GENIE grants WISHes defined in a WISHLIST data set. The administrator
will define one or more WISHLIST data sets and populate each with TOPIC(s)
suitable for your role.

It is recommended to use the same high level qulifier (HLQ) on all of the
WISHLIST data sets for easy identification. Use the second level qualifer
for role based WISHLIST data sets.

Use WISHLIST for the low level qualifier.

During the next two tasks the $INSTALL program will copy the two REXX
programs to your named SYSEXEC (or SYSPROC) data set and define one
WISHLIST data set. If you choose to have multiple role based WISHLIST data
sets then after creating your first one, come back and update the HLQ and
select the MSICDEFN task and optionally receive the desired TOPIC(S) into it.
Remember to run GENIEBLD to update the $$$$$$$$ configuration member.
