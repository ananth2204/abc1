NTRACE
N-------
NTRACE .returns trace actions currently in effect and, optionally,
Nalters the setting.
N
NIf you specify option, it selects the trace setting. It must be one of
Nthe valid prefixes ? or ! or one of the alphabetic character options
Nassociated with the TRACE instruction (that is, starting with
NA, C, E, F, I, L, N, O, R, or S) or both. (See the TRACE instruction
Nfor full details.)
N
NUnlike the TRACE instruction, the TRACE function alters the trace
Naction even ifinteractive debug is active. Also unlike the TRACE
Ninstruction, option cannot be a number.
N
I
N
N
NSyntax:
D  old_option = Trace("prefix"||"letter")
N
I        prefix:
I          ? = interactive debug
I          ! = inhibit host command execution
N
I        letter:
I          A = All clauses traced
I          C = All host commands traced
I          E = host commands with non-zero RC traced after execution
I          F = host commands with negative RC traced after execution
I          I = all intermediate results shown
I          L = show labels
I          N = host commands with negative RC traced after execution
I          O = Off, no more tracing
I          R = Results shown
N

NExample
N-------
I  old_option = Trace()
I  Say "Trace state:" old_option"."
I  Trace Off
I  trace_value = Trace("?L")
I  Say "Tracing was:" trace_value"."
I  trace_value = Trace("?I")                         /* Also does 'R' */
I  trace_value = Trace("?IRS")
I  Say "IT WAS:" trace_value"."
I  trace_value = Trace("O")
N
M  Say "Trace messages"
M  Say "*-*  sourceline"
M  Say "+++  trace messages"
M  Say ">>>  result of operation"
M  Say ">.>  value assigned to placeholder during parsing"
M  Say ">C>  compound variable"
M  Say ">F>  result of function call"
M  Say ">L>  literal"
M  Say ">O>  Result of operation on two terms"
M  Say ">P>  Result of prefix operation"
M  Say ">V>  Contents of a variable"
