NExample 10: Add a New Character to a Character Arrangement Table
NModule
N
N3800 Model 3
N
NIn this example, an IBM-supplied character arrangement table module is
Nmodified to include another character, and then added to the
NSYS1.IMAGELIB data set as a replacement for the IBM-supplied module.

NThe control statements are discussed below:
N
N  The SYSUT1 DD statement includes DISP=OLD to ensure that no other
N  job can modify the data set while this job is executing.
N
N  The INCLUDE statement specifies that a copy of the character
N  arrangement table named GF10 is to be used as a basis for the new
N  module.
N
N  The OPTION statement with the DEVICE parameter specifies 3800 Model
N  3 compatibility mode processing.
N
N  The TABLE statement specifies updated information for four
N  translation table entries: X'2A', X'6A', X'AA', and X'EA'. (These
N  four locations are unused in the IBM-supplied GF10 table.) Each of
N  the four translation table entries is to point to the '2A' (43rd
N  character) position in the first WCGM, which contains the scan
N  pattern for a lozenge.
N
N  The name of the character arrangement table is GF10, and it is
N  stored as a new module in the SYS1.IMAGELIB data set. The data set's
N  directory is updated so that the name GF10 points to the new module;
N  the old GF10 module can no longer be accessed through the data set's
N  directory.
* End of wish.
