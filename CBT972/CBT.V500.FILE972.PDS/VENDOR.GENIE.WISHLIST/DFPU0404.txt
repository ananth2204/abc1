NExample 4: Use Members and Input Records as Basis of Output Member
N
NIn this example, two partitioned members and input records from the
Ninput stream are used as the basis of a partitioned output member. Each
Nblock of 12 output records contains 10 modified records from an input
Npartitioned member and two records from the input stream.

NThe control statements are discussed below:
N
N  PARIN1 DD defines one of the input partitioned members.
N
N  PARIN 2 DD defines the second of the input partitioned members.
N  (Note that the members are from different partitioned data sets.)
N
N  PAROUT DD defines the output partitioned member. This example
N  assumes that the partitioned data set does not exist before the job
N  step; that is, this DD statement allocates space for the partitioned
N  data set.
N
N  SYSIN DD defines the control data set, which follows in the input
N  stream.
N
N  DSD marks the beginning of a set of utility control statements and
N  refers to the DD statements defining the input and output data sets.
N
N  FD creates a 13-byte field in which the picture "DEPARTMENT 21" is
N  placed.
N
N  The first REPEAT statement indicates that the following group of two
N  CREATE statements is to be repeated 10 times.
N
N  The first CREATE statement creates 10 output records. Each output
N  record is constructed from an input record (from partitioned data
N  set INSET1) and from previously defined FIELD1.
N
N  The second CREATE statement indicates that two records are to be
N  constructed from input records included next in the input stream.
N
N  The $$$E record separates the input records from the REPEAT
N  statement. The next REPEAT statement group is identical to the
N  preceding group, except that records from a different partitioned
N  member are used as input.
N
N  END signals the end of a set of utility control statements.
