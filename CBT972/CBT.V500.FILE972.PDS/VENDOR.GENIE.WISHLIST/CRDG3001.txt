NChapter 30. TERMINAL resources
N==============================
NTERMINAL attributes
N-------------------
NDescribes the syntax and attributes of the TERMINAL resource.
N
NSyntax:
N-------
D  DEFINE
D    TERMINAL(name)
I      Specifies the terminal identifier. For a terminal,
I      the name can be up to 4 characters in length.
N
I      If the name supplied is fewer than 4 characters, it is
I      left-justified and padded with blanks up to 4 characters. You
I      should not have a TERMINAL definition and a CONNECTION definition
I      with the same name.
N
I      Note: If you use a comma (,) in a name, you cannot use commands
I      such as:
N
I        CEMT INQUIRE TERMINAL(value1,value2)
I        CEMT SET TERMINAL(value1,value2)
N
I      where the comma serves as a list delimiter. See CICS Supplied
I      Transactions for information about using lists of resource
I      identifiers.
N
I      Also, if you are allowing CICS to automatically generate session
I      names or terminal IDs for consoles, avoid using any of the
I      following symbols as the first or fourth character in the terminal
I      name:
N
I      -: The hyphen is used by CICS for automatically generated terminal
I        names for APPC sessions
N
I      > and <: The > (greater than) and < (less than) symbols are used
I        by CICS for automatically generated terminal names for IRC
I        sessions
N
I      ,: The , (logical not) symbol is used by CICS for automatically
I        generated terminal names for MVS consoles.
N
I      The name specified becomes the name of the TCT entry, when this
I      TERMINAL definition is installed. For this reason, the TERMINAL
I      name must be unique.
N
I      Note that the value CERR is reserved for the identification
I      generated for the error console. If you specify AUTINSTMODEL(ONLY),
I      you do not need a unique TERMINAL name, because it is not used as
I      the name of a TCT entry. If you specify AUTINSTMODEL(YES), the
I      TERMINAL name is used as the name of the TCT entry that is
I      installed in the TCT when the TERMINAL definition is installed;
I      the names of the TCT entries for the autoinstalled terminals are
I      determined by the autoinstall user program.
N
I      If the terminal is to be associated with a transient data
I      destination, the terminal name and the transient data queue name
I      in the TDQUEUE resource definition must be the same.
N
D    GROUP(groupname)
I      Every resource definition must have a GROUP name.
I      The resource definition becomes a member of the group and is
I      installed in the CICS system when the group is installed.
N
I      The GROUP name can be up to 8 characters in length. Lowercase
I      characters are treated as uppercase characters.
N
D    DESCRIPTION(text)
I      You can provide a description of the resource that
I      you are defining in this field. The description text can be up to
I      58 characters in length. No restrictions apply to the characters
I      that you can use. However, if you use parentheses, ensure that for
I      each left parenthesis there is a matching right parenthesis. If you
I      use the CREATE command, for each single apostrophe in the text,
I      code two apostrophes.
N
D    ALTPRINTCOPY(NO | YES)
I      Specifies whether the hardware COPY feature
I      is to be used to satisfy a print request on the printer named in
I      the ALTPRINTER attribute. For more details, see the PRINTERCOPY
I      attribute.
N
I      NO: CICS will use the hardware COPY feature.
N
I      YES: CICS will not use the hardware COPY feature.
N
D    ALTPRINTER(printer)
I      Specifies the name of a 3270 printer to be used,
I      if the printer named in the PRINTER attribute of this terminal
I      definition is not available. The name can be up to 4 characters in
I      length. For more details, see the PRINTER attribute. If you specify
I      an ALTPRINTER without specifying a PRINTER, ALTPRINTER is ignored.
N
I      The printer that you name must be owned by the CICS system that
I      owns this terminal definition.
N
I      To specify the hardware COPY feature for the alternative printer,
I      specify YES for ALTPRINTCOPY on this terminal definition.
N
D    AUTINSTMODEL(NO | ONLY | YES)
I      Specifies whether this terminal
I      definition can be used as a model terminal definition for
I      autoinstall. For more information on autoinstall and model terminal
I      definitions, see "Autoinstalling z/OS Communications Server
I      terminals".
N
I      NO: This definition is not used as a model for autoinstall. It is
I        used only as a definition for a specific device that is not
I        autoinstalled.
N
I      ONLY: This definition is used only as a model for autoinstall. It
I        is not used as a definition for a specific device.
N
I      YES: This definition is used for a specific device that is not
I        autoinstalled. The definition is also used as a model for
I        automatic installation.
N
D    AUTINSTNAME(autinstname)
I      Specifies the name by which this model
I      definition is known in the autoinstall control program. The name
I      can be up to 8 characters in length.
N
I      You specify this name only if AUTINSTMODEL is YES or ONLY. You can
I      default to the terminal name followed by four blanks, if this name
I      is acceptable to the autoinstall control program. For more
I      information about autoinstall models, autoinstall names, and the
I      autoinstall control program, see "Autoinstall control program".
N
I      This attribute is obsolete, but is supported to provide
I      compatibility with earlier releases of CICS.
N
N    CONSOLE
I      This attribute is obsolete, but is supported to provide
I      compatibility with earlier releases of CICS.
N
D    CONSNAME(console)
I      Using CONSNAME, you can install a CICS console
I      definition without having an existing console, and without the
I      console being previously defined in the CONSOLnn member of the
I      MVS SYS1.PARMLIB. However, before you can use the console, you must
I      define the name to MVS, either in the CONSOLnn member of
I      SYS1.PARMLIB or by dynamic allocation. The length of CONSNAME must
I      be 2 - 8 characters and must begin with an alphabetic character or
I      one of #, @, or $. It uniquely identifies the console device in a
I      CICS region, regardless of the MVS image to which it is connected;
I      that is, you cannot install two console definitions with the same
I      CONSNAME. The CONSNAME corresponds to the name defined for the
I      console in the MVS SYS1.PARMLIB member, CONSOLnn.
N
I      To define a TSO user as a console device, specify CONSNAME(name),
I      where name is the TSO user ID. This definition enables a TSO user
I      authorized to use the TSO CONSOLE command to initiate CICS
I      transactions. The TSO user ID does not have to be defined in the
I      CONSOLnn member of SYS1.PARMLIB member.
N
I      The equivalent of CONSOLE(00) is CONSNAME(INTERNAL) or
I      CONSNAME(INSTREAM), depending on the service level of CICS and the
I      release of MVS being used; specify this option if you want to
I      initiate a CICS transaction and issue a command to it in a JCL
I      statement. For guidance about using JCL to issue CICS commands,
I      see the CICS Operations and Utilities Guide.
N
D    INSERVICE(YES | NO)
I      Specifies the status of the terminal that is
I      being defined.
N
I      YES: Transactions can be initiated and messages are automatically
I        sent to the terminal.
N
I      NO: The terminal cannot receive messages or transmit input.
N
D    NATLANG(code)
I      Specifies the language in which all
I      globalization-enabled messages are displayed for this terminal.
I      Specify one of the following NATLANG codes. The default is the
I      value specified in the NATLANG system initialization parameter.
N
I      E: English, which is the system default (that is, is provided even
I        if you do not specifically code E).
N
I      C: Simplified Chinese, a Double-Byte Character Set language.
I        Translation is performed by IBM.
N
I      K: Japanese, a Double-Byte Character Set language. Translation is
I        performed by IBM.
N
D    NETNAME(netname)
I      Specifies the network name that identifies the
I      terminal to ACF/Communications Server. The name can be up to
I      8 characters in length. The name follows assembler language rules
I      and must start with an alphabetic character.
N
I      If you do not specify a name, the NETNAME defaults to the
I      TERMINAL name.
N
I      The NETNAME must be unique except in the case of a remote terminal.
I      That is, you cannot install two local terminals with the same
I      NETNAME, or a local terminal and any connection with the same
I      NETNAME. However, the NETNAME for a remote terminal can be the
I      same as the NETNAME for any other terminal or the NETNAME for any
I      connection.
N
I      If the CICS region supports z/OS Communications Server dynamic LU
I      alias; that is, LUAPFX=xx is specified on the CICS region APPL
I      statement, the terminal with this NETNAME is assumed to be in the
I      same network as the CICS region. If the terminal is in another
I      network, it must be defined to z/OS Communications Server on a
I      CDRSC definition with a predefined LUALIAS (LUALIAS=netname) to
I      override z/OS Communications Server dynamic allocation. In this
I      case, netname on the LUALIAS parameter must match the NETNAME
I      defined on this terminal resource definition.
N
I    OPERID:
I    OPERPRIORITY:
I    OPERRSL:
I    OPERSECURITY: These attributes are obsolete, but are supported to
I      provide compatibility with earlier releases of CICS.
N
D    POOL(poolname)
I      Specifies the pool name for a 3600 or 3650 pipeline
I      terminal pooled with other pipeline terminals.
N
I      When you define a 3600 pipeline logical unit, you generate a
I      TCTTE that is associated with a pool of TCTTEs. A pool of pipeline
I      TCTTEs can be used by one pipeline logical unit, or it can be
I      shared by a number of pipeline logical units.
N
I      The pool name is used only as a method of identifying the related
I      TERMINAL definitions on the CSD file. It is not used in the active
I      CICS system. The name can be up to 8 characters in length.
N
I      For a pipeline terminal, you must specify a TYPETERM with
I      SESSIONTYPE(PIPELINE) specified. You must specify a TASKLIMIT on
I      at least one of the pool of pipeline terminals. You must name the
I      same group for each of the pipeline terminals in a pool.
N
I        Here is an example of the definitions for a pool of pipeline
I        terminals:
N
I        DEFINE TERMINAL(ttt1) GROUP(g)
I          NETNAME(nnnnnnn1)
I          POOL(poolid)
I          TYPETERM(xxxxxxxx)
I          ...
I        DEFINE TERMINAL(ttt2) GROUP(g)
I          NETNAME(nnnnnnn2)
I          POOL(poolid)
I          TYPETERM(xxxxxxxx)
I          ...
I        DEFINE TERMINAL(ttt3) GROUP(g)
I          NETNAME(nnnnnnn3)
I          POOL(poolid)
I          TYPETERM(xxxxxxxx)
I          ...
I        DEFINE TERMINAL(ttt4) GROUP(g)
I          NETNAME(nnnnnnn4)
I          POOL(poolid)
I          TASKLIMIT(nn)
I          TYPETERM(xxxxxxxx)
I          ...
I        DEFINE TYPETERM(xxxxxxxx) GROUP(g)
I          DEVICE(3650)
I          SESSIONTYPE(PIPELINE)
N
D    PRINTER(printer)
I      Specifies the name of the primary 3270 printer to
I      be used to respond to an ISSUE PRINT command or a PRINT request
I      from an operator pressing a program access (PA) key. The name can
I      be up to 4 characters in length. The name is the TERMINAL name on
I      the definition for the printer. If you name a PRINTER here, the
I      TYPETERM referenced by this TERMINAL definition must have
I      PRINTADAPTER(NO).
N
I      The printer that you name must be owned by the same CICS system
I      that owns this TERMINAL definition.
N
I      You can name a PRINTER if this TERMINAL definition is for one of
I      the following:
N
I      -> A 3270 display without the printer-adapter feature
N
I      -> A 3270 display attached to a 3274 control unit
N
I      -> A 3276 control unit display station
N
I      -> A 3790 in 3270 compatibility mode
N
I      If you want to specify the hardware COPY feature, specify
I      PRINTERCOPY(YES) on this TERMINAL definition.
N
I      Note that SNA character string (SCS) printers accept only 3790
I      data streams; they do not accept 3270 data streams. They therefore
I      cannot be used to print the buffer contents of a display unit.
N
I      If you use a program attention key, for example, PA1, to print
I      the contents of the screen on an associated z/OS Communications
I      Server printer, the screen size of the printer is chosen according
I      to the SCRNSIZE operand as defined in the CICS-supplied default
I      profile DFHCICST. This profile is defined with SCRNSIZE(DEFAULT)
I      and, if you want to use the alternate screen size of the printer,
I      you have to change the profile entry for transaction CSPP.
N
D    PRINTERCOPY(NO | YES)
I      Specifies whether the hardware COPY feature
I      is to be used to satisfy a print request on the printer named in
I      the PRINTER attribute of this terminal definition.
N
I      CICS uses the hardware COPY feature of the 3270 to perform the
I      print, unless a task is currently attached to the display.
N
I      You do not need to specify COPY(YES) on the TYPETERM definition,
I      because it is implied by PRINTERCOPY(YES) on the terminal
I      definition.
N
I      If you have named an ALTPRINTER as well as a PRINTER, you can
I      specify ALTPRINTCOPY(YES).
N
I      To use the COPY feature, both the printer and the display terminal
I      must be on the same 3270 control unit. Otherwise, either the COPY
I      might fail, raising an error condition, or, if the display device
I      address is valid for the printer control unit, copying might be
I      performed from a different display.
N
I      Do not specify PRINTERCOPY(YES) if, in a networking environment,
I      the 3270 control unit is connected to a TCAM system in one domain,
I      and a CICS system in another domain has access to the control unit
I      through z/OS Communications Server. The hardware COPY address is
I      not available to CICS and cannot therefore be used by terminals
I      attached to such a control unit.
N
I      The COPY command is invalid for a 3270 compatibility mode display.
N
D    REMOTENAME(terminal)
I      Specifies the name by which the terminal is
I      known in the system or region that owns the terminal. The name can
I      be up to 4 characters in length.
N
D    REMOTESYSNET(netname)
I      Specifies the network name (APPLID) of the
I      region that owns the terminal. The name can be up to 8 characters
I      in length. It follows assembler language rules, and must start
I      with an alphabetic character.
N
I      REMOTESYSNET is used where there is no direct link between the
I      region in which this definition is installed and the
I      terminal-owning region. You do not need to specify REMOTESYSNET
I      if either of the following is true:
N
I      -> You are defining a local terminal; that is, REMOTESYSTEM is not
I         specified, or specifies the sysid of the local system.
N
I      -> REMOTESYSTEM names a direct link to the terminal-owning region.
I         However, if the terminal-owning region is a member of a
I         z/OS Communications Server generic resources group and the
I         direct link is an APPC connection, you might need to specify
I         REMOTESYSNET.
N
I      REMOTESYSNET is needed in this case if the NETNAME specified on
I      the CONNECTION definition for the direct link is the generic
I      resource name of the TOR (not the applid).
N
D    REMOTESYSTEM(connection)
I      Specifies the name that identifies the
I      intercommunication link to the system that owns the terminal. The
I      name can be up to 4 characters in length.
N
I      REMOTESYSTEM is one of these identifiers:
N
I      -> For IPIC connections, the first 4 characters of the IPCONN name
I         on the IPCONN definition, which is in service and acquired.
N
I      -> For MRO and APPC connections, the CONNECTION name on the
I         CONNECTION definition. If the CONNECTION name is not specified,
I         or if the name is specified as the sysid of the local system,
I         the terminal is local to this system. If the name is the name
I         of another system, the terminal is remote. You can therefore
I         use the same definition for the terminal in both the local
I         system and a remote system.
N
I      If you have intermediate systems between this CICS and the
I      terminal-owning region, REMOTESYSTEM specifies the first link in
I      the path to the TOR. If more than one path is possible,
I      REMOTESYSTEM specifies the first link in the preferred path.
N
I      REMOTESYSTEM is ignored if you specify AUTINSTMODEL(YES) or
I      AUTINSTMODEL(ONLY).
N
D    SECURITYNAME(securityname)
I      Specifies the security name of the remote system.
N
I      In a CICS system with security initialized (SEC=YES or MIGRATE),
I      the security name is used to establish the authority of the remote
I      system.
N
I      If USERID is specified in the session definition (DEFINE SESSIONS
I      command) associated with the connection definition, the user ID
I      overrides the user ID specified in the SECURITYNAME attribute, and
I      is used for link security. The security name, or USERID on the
I      sessions definition, must be a valid RACF user ID on your system.
I      Access to protected resources on your system is based on the RACF
I      user profile and its group membership.
N
I      For more information on defining security for MRO, LUTYPE6.1, and
I      APPC connections, see the RACF Security Guide.
N
D    SOLICITED(NO | YES)
I      Specifies whether CICS messages issued to a
I      console will be treated by NetView as solicited or unsolicited.
N
I      NO: CICS messages will be treated as unsolicited
N
I      YES: CICS messages will be treated as solicited. When
I        SOLICITED(YES) is specified for a console, CICS adds the console
I        name or the console identification number and a command and
I        response token to each console message.
N
I      The SOLICITED attribute applies only to consoles; it is ignored
I      for other TERMINAL definitions.
N
D    TASKLIMIT(NO | number)
I      Specifies the number of concurrent tasks
I      allowed to run in a pipeline session or in a pool of pipeline
I      sessions.
N
I      NO: No concurrent tasks are allowed.
N
I      number: The number of concurrent tasks allowed to run, in the
I        range 1 - 32767.
N
I      When you define a 3600 pipeline logical unit, you generate a
I      TCTTE that is associated with a pool of TCTTEs. When messages
I      enter CICS from the 3600 pipeline logical unit, a task is attached
I      to process this message, using as an anchor block one of the TCTTEs
I      from the pool. In this way, consecutive messages sent using the
I      pipeline logical unit can be processed concurrently, the number
I      of concurrent transactions being limited by the number of TCTTEs
I      in the pool. The number of TCTTEs in the pool should represents
I      the high-water mark of inquiry activity. In this way, the pipeline
I      facility allows fewer TCTTEs to be defined to CICS than the total
I      number of pipeline inquiry terminals.
N
D    TERMPRIORITY(0 | priority)
I      Specifies the terminal priority. This
I      decimal value (0 - 255) is used in establishing the overall
I      transaction processing priority. Transaction processing priority
I      is equal to the sum of the terminal priority, transaction priority,
I      and operator priority, not exceeding 255.
N
D    TRANSACTION(transaction)
I      Specifies a 1- to 4-character name of the
I      transaction that is to be initiated each time input is received
I      from the terminal when there is no active task.
N
I      For z/OS Communications Server non-3270 devices, a TRANSACTION name
I      of fewer than 4 characters requires a delimiter.
N
I      For information on what happens when a transaction is initiated,
I      see the CICS Application Programming Guide.
N
I      If you specify this operand for a 3270 display, the only CICS
I      functions the operator can start, other than this transaction, are
I      paging commands and print requests.
N
I      You are unlikely to specify the TRANSACTION attribute for a 3270
I      display or SCS printer. It is optional for 3601 logical units,
I      but is mandatory for 3614 logical units.
N
I      If this operand is specified for a 3790 Communication System, and
I      multiple sessions are used to connect the same 3791, specify the
I      same TRANSACTION name for all sessions.
N
D    TYPETERM(typeterm)
I      Specifies the name of the TYPETERM definition to
I      be associated with this TERMINAL definition. The name can be up to
I      8 characters in length.
N
I      The TYPETERM definition specifies many attributes for a number of
I      similar terminals. For more information, see "TYPETERM attributes"
I      and "Ways of defining CICS resources". The TYPETERM attribute is
I      mandatory for all TERMINAL definitions.
N
I      The TYPETERM definition must already be installed when you install
I      this TERMINAL definition.
N
D    USERID(userid | *EVERY | *FIRST)
I      Specifies a user identifier used for
I      sign-on and referred to in security error messages, security
I      violation messages, and the audit trail. It must be a valid
I      user ID defined to the security manager.
N
I      The USERID attribute provides the only way to specify a user
I      identifier for devices such as printers that are unable to sign
I      on using CESN. You can also specify USERID for a display device;
I      if so, the display is permanently signed on. Operators are unable
I      to sign on. All access to protected resources depends on the
I      authorizations permitted by RACF for the specified USERID.
N
I      For an APPC single session terminal, USERID overrides any
I      SECURITYNAME that you have specified for the connection.
N
I      name: This name can be up to 8 characters in length.
N
I      *EVERY: This special operand is for autoinstalled consoles only.
I        It means that CICS is to use the user ID passed on the
I        MVS MODIFY command every time a MODIFY command is received. The
I        console is signed on using the MVS user ID as the preset
I        user ID for the console being autoinstalled. The console remains
I        signed on with this user ID until the console is deleted or
I        another MODIFY is received with another user ID. If a MODIFY
I        command is received without a user ID, CICS signs on the default
I        CICS user ID until a MODIFY command is received that has a valid
I        user ID. For non-console terminals, or if security is not
I        enabled, this value is ignored.
N
I      *FIRST: This special is operand for autoinstalled consoles only.
I        It means that CICS is to use the user ID passed on the first
I        MVS MODIFY command that requires the console to be autoinstalled.
I        The console is signed on with the MVS user ID as the preset
I        user ID. The console remains signed on with this user ID until
I        the console is deleted. If a MODIFY command is received without
I        a user ID, CICS signs on the default CICS user ID. For
I        non-console terminals, or if security is not enabled, this value
I        is ignored.
N
I      If this terminal definition defines a console, the user ID must
I      be authorized to the appropriate profile in the CONSOLE general
I      resource class. See the CICS RACF Security Guide for information
I      about preset security on consoles and terminals.

NAPPC attributes:
N----------------
D    ATTACHSEC(LOCAL | IDENTIFY | MIXIDPE | PERSISTENT | VERIFY)
I      (APPC only):
I      Specifies the level of attach time user security required for the
I      connection.
N
I      PERSISTENT and MIXIDPE are valid only with z/OS Communications
I      Server as the access method and when APPC is used.
N
I      LOCAL: The authority of the user is taken to be the authority of
I      the link itself, and link security protects only the resource.
N
I      IDENTIFY: Incoming attach requests must specify a user identifier.
I        Specify IDENTIFY when the connecting terminal has a security
I        manager.
N
I      MIXIDPE: A connection can support attaches using either or both of
I        the IDENTIFY and PERSISTENT security types. The security type
I        used depends on the incoming attach.
N
I        As in previous releases, IDENTIFY implies a degree of trust
I        between the two systems that allows this system to accept the
I        sign-on logic of the other system. In effect, you have a
I        distributed security manager, with one system performing the
I        sign-on function and the other system performing the security
I        check.
N
I      PERSISTENT: This option involves a user sign-on to a remote system
I        that persists over multiple conversations until the user signs
I        off from the remote system. In this way, the user ID and password
I        are passed only on the first (sign-on) attach. Subsequent attach
I        requests require only the user ID.
N
I      VERIFY: Incoming attach requests must specify a user identifier and
I        a user password. Specify VERIFY when the connecting terminal has
I        no security manager and therefore requires verification.
N
D    BINDSECURITY(NO | YES)
I      (APPC only): Specifies whether an external
I      security manager (ESM) is being used for bind-time security.
N
I      NO: No external bind-time security is required.
N
I      YES: If security is active and the XAPPC system initialization
I        parameter is set to YES, CICS attempts to extract the session
I        key from RACF to carry out bind-time security. If no RACF
I        profile is available, the bind fails.
N
D    MODENAME(modename)
I      (APPC single session terminals only): Specifies
I      the name that is passed to z/OS Communications Server as the
I      LOGMODE name. The name can be up to 8 characters in length, but
I      cannot have the reserved name SNASVCMG. The name follows assembler
I      language rules and must start with an alphabetic character.
N
I      For further guidance on the LOGMODE name, see Coding entries in
I      the z/OS Communications Server LOGON mode table in the
I      CICS Customization Guide.
N
D    USEDFLTUSER(NO | YES)
I      (APPC only): Specifies the kind of security
I      checking that will take place for each inbound attach FMH.
N
I      NO: Indicates that each inbound attach FMH will be checked for the
I        presence of those fields required by the ATTACHSEC option. If
I        the required fields are not present, a protocol violation message
I        is issued and the attach fails. NO is the default.
N
I      YES: Indicates that some checks on the validity of the attach
I        Function Management Header (FMH) are bypassed. See the
I        CICS RACF Security Guide.
