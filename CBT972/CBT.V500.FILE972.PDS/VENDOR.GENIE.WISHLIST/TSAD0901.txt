NChapter 9: Master trace
N-----------------------
NMaster trace and the hardcopy log
N---------------------------------
NMaster trace lists the same messages that the system saves automatically
Nand permanently in the hardcopy log, but the entries are maintained in a
Nwraparound table, which means that master trace overwrites old entries
Nwhen the table is full.
N
NYou can use master trace data in a dump as a substitute for the hardcopy
Nlog when the dump contains the required messages. If the master trace
Ntable wraps and overwrites the messages related to your problem before
Nyou can request a dump, the dump will not contain useful messages.
N
NConsider the following conditions:
N
N-> The master trace table wraps at 9 p.m.
N
N-> The system issues messages related to a problem between 9:10 and
N   9:20 p.m.
N
N-> The system issues an SVC dump at 9:30 p.m.
N
NIn this example, the messages pertinent to the problem will be in the
Nmaster trace data in the dump, since the problem occurred between the
Ntime the trace table wrapped and the time the dump was issued.
N
NTo print the system-managed data set containing the hardcopy log, use
Nthe JESDS parameter of the OUTPUT JCL statement.
