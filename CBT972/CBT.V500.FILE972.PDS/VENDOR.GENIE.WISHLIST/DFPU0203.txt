NExample 3: Compare Sequential Data Sets Written at Different Densities
NIn this example, two sequential data sets that were written at
Ndifferent densities on different tape units are compared.

NThe control statements are discussed, as follows:
N
N  SYSUT1 DD defines an input data set, SET1, which is the first
N  or only data set on a labeled, 7-track tape volume. The blocked
N  data set was originally written at a density of 556 bits per
N  inch (DEN=1) with the data converter on (TRTCH=C).
N
N  SYSUT2 DD defines an input data set, SET2, which is the first
N  or only blocked data set on a labeled tape volume. In this
N  example, assume SYSUT2 is on a 9-track tape drive.
N
N  SYSIN DD defines the control data set, which follows in the
N  input stream.
N
N  COMPARE TYPORG=PS specifies that the input data sets are
N  sequentially organized.
N
N  EXITS identifies the names of routines to be used to process
N  user input header labels and trailer labels.
N
N  LABELS DATA=NO specifies that the user input header and trailer
N  labels for each data set are not to be compared.
