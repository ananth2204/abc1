MDFSMSdss should be used instead of IEHMOVE to move or copy data to
Mvolumes managed by the Storage Management Subsystem. DFSMSdss or
MIEBCOPY should be used to process PDSEs. You cannot use IEHMOVE with
MPDSEs or ISAM or VSAM data sets.

NExample 2: Move Partitioned Data Set to Disk Volume and Merge
N
NIn this example, a partitioned data set (PARTSET1) is moved to a disk
Nvolume. In addition, a member (PARMEM3) from another partitioned data
Nset (PARTSET2) is merged with the source members on the receiving
Nvolume. The source partitioned data set (PARTSET1) is scratched. Space
Nis allocated by IEHMOVE.

NThe control statements are discussed below:
N
N  SYSUT1 DD defines the disk volume that is to contain the work data
N  set.
N
N  DD1 DD defines the system residence device.
N
N  The DD2, DD3, and DD4 DD statements define devices that are to
N  contain the two source volumes and the receiving volume.
N
N  SYSIN DD defines the control data set, which follows in the input
N  stream.
N
N  MOVE defines the source partitioned data set, the volume that
N  contains it, and its receiving volume.
N
N  INCLUDE includes a member from a second partitioned data set in the
N  operation.
