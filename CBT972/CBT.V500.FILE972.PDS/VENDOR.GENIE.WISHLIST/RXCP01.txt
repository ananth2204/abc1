NUsing the REXX Compiler
N=======================
NThe REXX Compiler and Library is an additional fee based product.
NIf you have it then you may compile your REXX code into one or more
Nexecutable types of output. IEXEC is an expanded version of source
Nthat contained %include directoves. CEXEC is compiled rexx executable
Nfrom a TSO environment. An OBJLIB output is input to the BINDER to
Neither be included as a sub-routine or turned into a load module.

MKenneth Tomiak remark:
MThe presentation focuses on z/VM for the interactive dialog and
Mon z/OS for the batch processing. These GENIE wish files are z/OS
Moriented.
M
MIBM provides a "Foreground" menu, option 14, for the interactive
Mdialog. Your installation may not have the required data sets added
Mduring the logon process for it to function. For that reason, Kenneth
Mhad provided a simple REXX program to show how to allocate the dialog
Mdata sets and launch the program. See: RXCP0100.
