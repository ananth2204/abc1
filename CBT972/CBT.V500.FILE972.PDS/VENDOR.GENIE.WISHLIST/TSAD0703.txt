NCommon bad addresses
N--------------------
NThe following are commonly known as bad addresses. If you recognize
Nthese in the code you are diagnosing, focus your problem source
Nidentification on these areas:
N
N-> X'000C0000', X'040C0000', or X'070C0000', and one of these addresses
N   plus some offset. These are generally the result of some code using
N   0 as the base register for a control block and subsequently loading
N   a pointer from 0 plus an offset, thereby picking up the first half of
N   a PSW in the PSA.
N
N   Look for storage overlays in code pointed to by an old PSW. These
N   overlays result when 0 plus an offset cause the second half of a PSW
N   to be used as a pointer.
N
N-> X'C00', X'D00', X'D20', X'D28', X'D40', and other pointers to fields
N   in the normal functional recovery routine (FRR) stack. Routines often
N   lose the contents of a register during a SETFRR macro expansion and
N   incorrectly use the address of the 24-byte work area returned from
N   the expansion.
N
N-> Register save areas. Storage might be overlaid by code doing a store
N   multiple (STM) instruction with a bad register save area address. In
N   this case, the registers saved are often useful in determining the
N   component or module at fault.
