NChapter 19. MAPSET resources
N============================
NMAPSET attributes
N-----------------
NDescribes the syntax and attributes of the MAPSET resource.
N
NSyntax:
N-------
D  DEFINE
D    MAPSET(name)
I      Specifies the name of this MAPSET definition. The
I      name can be up to eight characters in length.
N
I      Do not use map set names beginning with DFH, because these
I      characters are reserved for use by CICS.
N
I      For a BMS device-dependent map set, the map set name must be
I      derived by adding the map set suffix to the original (1-to
I      7-character) map set name. The suffix depends on the parameter
I      specified in the TERM operand of the DFHMSD macro instruction that
I      defined the map set.
N
I      To use device-dependent suffixes, you need to specify BMS=(,,,DDS)
I      as a system initialization parameter. For information on map set
I      suffixes, see the CICS Application Programming Guide.
N
D    GROUP(groupname)
I      Every resource definition must have a GROUP name.
I      The resource definition becomes a member of the group and is
I      installed in the CICS system when the group is installed.
N
I      The GROUP name can be up to 8 characters in length. Lowercase
I      characters are treated as uppercase characters.
N
D    DESCRIPTION(text)
I      You can provide a description of the resource that
I      you are defining in this field. The description text can be up to
I      58 characters in length. No restrictions apply to the characters
I      that you can use. However, if you use parentheses, ensure that for
I      each left parenthesis there is a matching right parenthesis. If you
I      use the CREATE command, for each single apostrophe in the text,
I      code two apostrophes.
N
D    RESIDENT(NO | YES)
I      Specifies the residence status of the map set.
N
I      NO: The map set is not to be permanently resident.
N
I      YES: The map set is to be loaded on first reference and is then
I        to be permanently resident in virtual storage, but is to be
I        pageable by the operating system.
N
I    RSL: This attribute is obsolete, but is supported to provide
I      compatibility with earlier releases of CICS. For more information,
I      see Appendix A, "Obsolete attributes".
N
D    STATUS(ENABLED | DISABLED)
I      Specifies the map set status.
N
I      DISABLED: The map set may not be used.
N
I      ENABLED: The map set may be used.
N
D    USAGE(NORMAL | TRANSIENT)
I      Specifies when the storage for this map
I      set will be released.
N
I      NORMAL: When the use count of the map set reaches zero, it will
I        become eligible for removal from storage as part of the normal
I        dynamic storage compression process.
N
I      TRANSIENT: When the use count for this map set becomes zero, the
I        storage for this map set is released. This value should be
I        specified for map sets that are referenced infrequently.
N
D    USELPACOPY(NO | YES)
I      Specifies whether the map set is to be used
I      from the link pack area (LPA).
N
I      NO: The map set is not to be used from the LPA. It is loaded into
I        the CICS partition.
N
I      YES: The map set can be used from the LPA if LPA=YES is specified
I        as a system initialization parameter. The use of the map set from
I        the LPA requires that it has been installed there and that the
I        map set is not named by the PRVMOD start-up option. For further
I        guidance on this, see the CICS Transaction Server for
I        z/OS Installation Guide.
