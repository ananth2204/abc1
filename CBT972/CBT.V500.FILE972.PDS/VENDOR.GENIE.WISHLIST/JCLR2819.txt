NJES3 Control Statement
N======================
NJECL //*OPERATOR Statement
N--------------------------
NUse the //*OPERATOR statement to issue a message to the operator.
NColumns 1 through 80 are written on the operator console and in the
Njob's hard-copy log when JES3 reads in the job.
N
D//*OPERATOR message
M
MLike the JES2 /*MESSAGE control card, a way to issue a message to
Mthe operator console where it is likely to go unnoticed. Pick up
Mthe telephone and give them a call.
N
NExample 1: You can try, but today's operators will never see it.
N----------------------------------------------------------------
NThis IBM example dates back many decades. Console message traffic
Nincreased to a point where message suppression became the normal
Npractice to dedicate more CPU cycles to actual work, however many
Nsystems have unmanned consoles. Products like IOF and SDSF were
Nmade available to those who have a business requirement to see
Nreal-time status of jobs. Thus, today, the //*OPERATOR Statement
Nhas outlived its usefullness.
N
D//*OPERATOR CALL EXT. 55523 WHEN THIS JOB STARTS
* End of wish.
