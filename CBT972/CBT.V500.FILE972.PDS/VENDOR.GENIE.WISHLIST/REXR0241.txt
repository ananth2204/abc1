N--------------------------------
N  Commands to external environments
N  ---------------------------------
N    Environments
N    ------------
NThe system under which REXX programs run is assumed to include at
Nleast one host command environment for processing commands. An
Nenvironment is selected by default on entry to a REXX program. In
NTSO/E REXX, the environment for processing host commands is known as
Nthe host command environment. TSO/E provides different environments
Nfor TSO/E and non-TSO/E address spaces. You can change the environment
Nby using the ADDRESS instruction. You can find out the name of the
Ncurrent environment by using the ADDRESS built-in function. The
Nunderlying operating system defines environments external to the
NREXX program.
N
NThe host command environment selected depends on the caller. For
Nexample, if you call a REXX program from a TSO/E address space, the
Ndefault host command environment that TSO/E provides for processing
Nhost commands is TSO. If you call an exec from a non-TSO/E address
Nspace, the default host command environment that TSO/E provides is
NMVS.
