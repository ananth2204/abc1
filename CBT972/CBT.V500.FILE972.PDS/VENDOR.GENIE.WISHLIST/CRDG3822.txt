N==========================================================
NInvoking DFHCSDUP as a batch program
N------------------------------------
NThe DFHCSDUP SCAN command
N-------------------------
NSCAN all the IBM-supplied groups and user-defined groups for a
Nspecified resource. The definition of the matched resource in an IBM
Nsupplied group is compared with the definition(s) of the corresponding
Nmatched resource in the user groups.
M
MThis is the equivalent of using a wildcard with CEDA.

N
NOptions
N-------
N    Alias(aliasname): specifies the alias name of the resource type to
N                      be searched for in the user-defined groups.
N
N                      This operand is optional.
N
N    resource-type(resource-name): specifies the name of the resource
N                                  type to be searched for in the
N                                  IBM-supplied groups, and in the
N                                  user-defined groups if aliasname is
N                                  not specified. The resource option
N                                  must always be the first operand of
N                                  the SCAN command.
