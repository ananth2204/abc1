NHints on how to run the reports:
N--------------------------------
N 1) Research first:
N    a) Find your SMPE global CSI.
N       Ask, find a job that was used, or use ISPF 3.4
N       to search on **.CSI and bear the pain of searching every
N       catalog known in your master catalog. It helps if you know the
N       high level qualifier. Often, SMPE.**.CSI will work for you.
N       Some shops use CICS.**.CSI and DB2.**.CSI to split things up.
N
N    b) Find your CPAC order database.
N       Next, look at the way you invoke the CPAC dialog to find
N       the **.SCPPVENU dataset you use. If you need to, use ISPF 3.4
N       to search on **.SCPPVENU and bear the pain of searching every
N       catalog known in your master catalog. It helps if you know the
N       high level qualifier. Often, SMPE.**.SCPPVENU will work for you.
N
N 2) Go ahead and allocate the datasets for the REPORTS and ISPF
N    tables using PMAU$ALC as a starting point.
N
N 3) Start the ISPF based SMPE dialog.
N
N 4) Choose option 6.
N    6  MIGRATION ASSISTANT- Generate Planning and Migration Reports
N
N 5) Click the MENU bar Actions entry.
N
N    a) Choose option 1.
N       1. Configure
N
N    b) Add a jobcard to get stuffed on each job as you create them.
N
N    c) Enter the ISPF and SMPE datasets enclosed in apostrophes.
N
N    d) < page-down > to get all the configuration data options.
N
N 6) Know what you are working from.
N
N    a) Click the MENU bar Actions entry.
N
N    b) Choose option 2.
N       2. List date of Software Information Base
N
N    c) Review the dates.

N       REALLY OUT OF DATE?
N       Try running PMAUCF02 to download the Software Information Base
N       directly to your system or use one of these sites to download
N       to your personal computer and then upload.

N       You can tailor PMAUCF03 to receive and apply the PTF or
N       attempt to run the REXX code.
N       Running the REXX code will result in the ignorable error:
