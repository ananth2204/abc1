NExample 3: Create New Library Using SYS1.MACLIB as a Source
N
NIn this example, a three-member partitioned data set (NEWMCLIB) is
Ncreated. The data set will contain two members, ATTACH and DETACH,
Ncopied from an existing partitioned data set (SYS1.MACLIB), and a new
Nmember, EXIT, which is contained in the control data set.

NThe control statements are discussed below:
N
N  SYSUT1 DD defines the input partitioned data set SYS1.MACLIB, which
N  is assumed to be cataloged.
N
N  SYSUT2 DD defines the output partitioned data set
N  DEV.DRIVER3.NEWMCLIB. Enough space is allocated to allow for
N  subsequent modifications without creating a new master data set.
N
N  SYSIN DD defines the control data set, which follows in the input
N  stream.
N
N  The REPRO function statements identify the existing input members
N  (ATTACH and DETACH) to be copied onto the output data set. These
N  members are also listed in the message data set (because LIST=ALL is
N  specified).
N
N  The ADD function statement indicates that records (subsequent data
N  statements) are to be placed as members in the output partitioned
N  data set, called EXIT. The data statements are to be listed in the
N  message data set.
N
N  The NUMBER detail statement assigns sequence numbers to the data
N  statements. (The data statements contain blank sequence numbers in
N  columns 73 through 80.) The first record of the output member is
N  assigned sequence number 10; subsequent record numbers are increased
N  by 100.
N
N  ENDUP signals the end of SYSIN data.
I
I  Note that the three named input members (ATTACH, DETACH, and EXIT)
I  do not have to be specified in the order of their collating sequence
I  in the old master.
M
MKenneth points out that processing members in sorted sequence is more
Mefficient. Thus, while you do not have ot, it is a good practice.
