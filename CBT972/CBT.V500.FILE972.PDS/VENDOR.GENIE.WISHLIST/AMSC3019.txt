NExample 8: Encipher Using Private Keys
N--------------------------------------
NThe enciphered data set is deciphered at a remote installation. The
Nkeys are managed by the Programmed Cryptographic Facility, the
NCryptographic Unit Support, or the z/OS Integrated Cryptographic
NService Facility.

NThe JCL statements are:
N-----------------------
N-> CLEAR: describes the SAM data set.
N
N-> CRYPT: describes the entry-sequenced data set.
N
N-> KEYIN: describes the data encrypting key data set consisting of a
N   single record containing the data encrypting key.
N
NThe REPRO parameters are:
N-------------------------
N-> INFILE: points to the CLEAR DD statement, identifying the source
N   data set to be enciphered, MY.SAMDS1.
N
N-> OUTFILE: points to the CRYPT DD statement, identifying the target
N   data set, MY.ESDS1. The defined maximum record size of the
N   entry-sequenced data set must be large enough to accommodate the
N   largest SAM record.
N
N-> REUSE: indicates that the target data set is to be opened as a
N   reusable data set. If the data set was defined as REUSE, it is
N   reset to empty; otherwise, the REPRO command will end.
N
N-> ENCIPHER: indicates that the target data set is to contain an
N   enciphered copy of the source data set.
N
N   -> PRIVATEKEY: indicates that the key is to be managed by the user.
N
N   -> DATAKEYFILE: points to the KEYIN DD statement that supplies the
N      plaintext data encrypting key, X'53467568503A7C29', to be used
N      to encipher the data.
