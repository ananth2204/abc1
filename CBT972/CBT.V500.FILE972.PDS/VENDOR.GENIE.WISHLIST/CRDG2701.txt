NChapter 27. SESSIONS resources
N==============================
NSESSIONS attributes
N-------------------
NDescribes the syntax and attributes of the SESSIONS resource.
N
NSyntax:
N-------
D  DEFINE
D    SESSIONS(name)
I      Specifies the name of this SESSIONS definition. The
I      name can be up to eight characters in length.
N
I      This name is used to identify the SESSIONS definition on the CSD
I      file. It is not used within the active CICS system.
N
D    GROUP(groupname)
I      Every resource definition must have a GROUP name.
I      The resource definition becomes a member of the group and is
I      installed in the CICS system when the group is installed.
N
I      The GROUP name can be up to 8 characters in length. Lowercase
I      characters are treated as uppercase characters.
N
D    DESCRIPTION(text)
I      You can provide a description of the resource that
I      you are defining in this field. The description text can be up to
I      58 characters in length. No restrictions apply to the characters
I      that you can use. However, if you use parentheses, ensure that for
I      each left parenthesis there is a matching right parenthesis. If you
I      use the CREATE command, for each single apostrophe in the text,
I      code two apostrophes.
N
D    PROTOCOL(APPC | LU61 | EXCI)
I      Specifies the type of protocol that is
I      to be used for an intercommunication link (ISC or MRO).
N
I      APPC (LUTYPE6.2): Advanced program-to-program communication (APPC)
I        protocol.
N
I        Specify this for CICS-CICS ISC.
N
I      EXCI: The external CICS interface. Specify this to indicate that
I        the sessions are for use by a non-CICS client program using the
I        external CICS interface.
N
I      LU61: LUTYPE6.1 protocol. Specify this for CICS-CICS ISC, for
I        CICS-IMS, or for MRO.
N
D    AUTOCONNECT(NO | ALL | YES)
I      Specifies how connections are to be
I      established. What you have to specify for LU6.1 and APPC sessions
I      is discussed below:
N
I      APPC sessions:
I        For a z/OS Communications Server-connected system that has
I        AUTOCONNECT(YES) or (ALL) on the connection definition:
N
I        NO: CICS does not attempt to bind any sessions when the
I          connection is established. However, one or more user sessions
I          may be allocated as part of any ACQUIRE CONNECTION processing
I          which takes place.
N
I        YES or ALL: A contention-winner session is established (that is,
I          BIND is performed) during CICS initialization, or when
I          communication with z/OS Communications Server is started
I          using the CEMT SET VTAM OPEN command. If the connection cannot
I          be made at this time because the remote system is unavailable,
I          the link must be subsequently acquired using the
I          CEMT SET CONNECTION(sysid) INSERVICE ACQUIRED command, unless
I          the remote system becomes available in the meantime and itself
I          initiates communications.
N
I          AUTOCONNECT(ALL) should not be specified for sessions to other
I          CICS systems, because this can cause a bind race.
N
I        For a z/OS Communications Server-connected system that has
I        AUTOCONNECT(NO) on the CONNECTION definition:
N
I        ALL: All sessions, not just contention winners, are established
I          when the connection is acquired by issuing
I          CEMT SET CONNECTION(name) ACQUIRED, or when the remote system
I          itself initiates communication.
N
I        NO: CICS does not attempt to bind any sessions when the
I          connection is established. However, one or more user sessions
I          may be allocated as part of any ACQUIRE CONNECTION processing
I          that takes place.
N
I        YES: Contention-winner sessions are established when the
I          connection is acquired by issuing
I          CEMT SET CONNECTION(sysid) ACQUIRED, or when the remote
I          system itself initiates communication.
N
I      LU6.1 sessions:
I        Specify AUTOCONNECT(YES) on the SESSIONS if you want the
I        connection to be established at initialization or CEDA install.
N
I        Specify AUTOCONNECT(NO) on the SESSIONS if you do not want the
I        connection to be established at initialization or CEDA
I        installation.
N
D    BUILDCHAIN(YES | NO)
I      Specifies whether CICS is to perform chain
I      assembly before passing the input data to the application program.
N
I      NO: Any TIOA received by an application program from this logical
I        unit contains one request unit (RU).
N
I      YES: Any terminal input/output area (TIOA) received by an
I        application program from this logical unit contains a complete
I        chain.
N
D    CONNECTION(connection)
I      Specifies the name of the connection
I      definition that you want to use with this session definition. The
I      name can be up to four characters in length.
N
I      Note that the CONNECTION definition must be in the same GROUP as
I      the SESSIONS definition.
N
I    INSERVICE: This attribute is obsolete, but is supported to provide
I      compatibility with earlier releases of CICS.
N
D    NEPCLASS(0 | tranclass)
I      Specifies the transaction class for the
I      node error program. This value acts as the default.
N
I      0: This results in a link to the default node error program module.
N
I      tranclass: The transaction class for the (nondefault) node error
I        program module. The value can be in the range 1 through 255. For
I        programming information about the node error program, see the
I        CICS Customization Guide.
N
I      The NEPCLASS attribute is ignored for SNASVCMGR sessions.
N
I    OPERID:
I    OPERPRIORITY:
I    OPERRSL:
I    OPERSECURITY: These attributes ares obsolete, but are supported to
I      provide compatibility with earlier releases of CICS.
N
D    RECEIVESIZE(4096 | number)
I      Specifies the maximum z/OS Communications
I      Server request unit (RU) size that these sessions are capable of
I      receiving. The value must be between 1 and 30720 for LU61 sessions,
I      or 256 and 30720 for APPC sessions. The default is 4096.
N
I      The value specified is transmitted to the connected logical unit.
I      This value may be rounded down by CICS, depending on what value
I      you specified, because the value must be transmitted in an
I      architected form. The value may be negotiated down still further
I      at BIND time.
N
I      If CICS is the secondary LU session, this indicates the maximum
I      z/OS Communications Server request unit (RU) size that these
I      sessions are capable of sending.
N
I    RECOVNOTIFY: This attribute is obsolete, but is supported to provide
I      compatibility with earlier releases of CICS.
N
D    RECOVOPTION(SYSDEFAULT | CLEARCONV | NONE | RELEASESESS |
D      UNCONDREL)
I      This option applies to the recovery of sessions in a CICS region
I      running with z/OS Communications Server persistent sessions, or
I      with XRF.
N
I      z/OS Communications Server persistent sessions: In a CICS region
I      running with persistent session support, this option specifies
I      how you want CICS to recover the session, and return the terminal
I      to service on system restart within the persistent session delay
I      interval.
N
I      XRF: In a CICS region running with XRF support, this option
I        specifies how you want CICS to recover the session, and return
I        the terminal to service after an XRF takeover.
N
I      For all recovery options other than NONE, if the action taken is
I      a z/OS Communications Server UNBIND, the UNBIND is followed by a
I      z/OS Communications Server SIMLOGON.
N
I      CLEARCONV: z/OS Communications Server persistent sessions:I
I        CLEARCONV is not supported for APPC sessions. It defaults to
I        SYSDEFAULT.
N
I        XRF: If AUTOCONNECT(YES) is specified, the session is restarted.
I          If AUTOCONNECT(NO) is specified, the session is unbound.
N
I      NONE: z/OS Communications Server persistent sessions: In a CICS
I        region running with persistent sessions support, this specifies
I        that the session is not to be recovered at system restart within
I        the persistent session delay interval: in effect, the sessions on
I        the modegroup have no persistent sessions support. LU6.2 sessions
I        are unbound and the modegroup CNOS value is reset to zero. After
I        system restart, the session is reconnected automatically if you
I        specify AUTOCONNECT(YES).
N
I        XRF: In a CICS region running with XRF support, this specifies
I        that the logon state is not tracked by the alternate system, and
I        the terminal session is not automatically recovered after a
I        takeover; in effect, the terminal has no XRF support. After
I        takeover, the terminal is reconnected automatically by the
I        alternate system, if you specify AUTOCONNECT(YES).
N
I      RELEASESESS: z/OS Communications Server persistent sessions:
I        RELEASESESS is not supported for APPC sessions. It defaults to
I        SYSDEFAULT.
N
I        XRF: If AUTOCONNECT(YES) is specified, the session is restarted.
I        If AUTOCONNECT(NO) is specified, the session is unbound.
N
I      SYSDEFAULT: z/OS Communications Server persistent sessions: In a
I        CICS region running with persistent sessions support, this
I        specifies that CICS is to select the optimum procedure to
I        recover a session on system restart within the persistent
I        session delay interval, depending on the session activity and
I        on the characteristics of the terminal.
N
I        Although sessions are recovered, any transactions in-flight at
I        the time of the failure are abended and not recovered.
I        Transactions are also abended if the recovered session is being
I        used by another CICS region over an APPC connection.
N
I        CICS recovers the session with the least possible impact, in
I        one of the following ways:
N
I          -> If the session was not busy at the time that CICS failed,
I             no action is required.
N
I          -> If the session was busy at the time that CICS failed, CICS
I             issues a DEALLOCATE(ABEND) (equivalent to an
I             EXEC CICS ISSUE ABEND) for the APPC conversation in
I             progress at the time of the failure.
N
I          -> If neither of these events apply, the session is unbound.
N
I        XRF: If AUTOCONNECT(YES) is specified, the session is restarted.
I        If AUTOCONNECT(NO) is specified, the session is unbound.
N
I      UNCONDREL: Requires CICS to send an UNBIND request to release the
I        active session. The UNBIND is sent whether or not the session was
I        busy at the time of system restart (in the case of persistent
I        sessions support) or takeover (in the case of XRF).
N
D    RELREQ(NO | YES)
I      Specifies whether CICS is to release the logical
I      unit upon request by another z/OS Communications Server application
I      program.
N
D    SENDSIZE(4096 | number)
I      Specifies the maximum z/OS Communications
I      Server request unit (RU) size that these sessions are capable of
I      sending. The value must be between 1 and 30720 for LU61 sessions,
I      or between 256 and 30720 for APPC sessions. The default is 4096.
I      The value may be negotiated down at bind time. Increasing the
I      value of SENDSIZE causes more storage to be allocated for the
I      session but may decrease the number of physical messages sent
I      between the two nodes.
N
I      If CICS is the secondary LU session, this attribute indicates the
I      maximum z/OS Communications Server request unit (RU) size that
I      these sessions are capable of receiving. The value must be
I      between 256 and 30720.
N
D    SESSPRIORITY(0 | priority)
I      Specifies the terminal priority. This
I      decimal value (0 through 255) is used in establishing the overall
I      transaction processing priority. (Transaction processing priority
I      is equal to the sum of the terminal priority, transaction priority,
I      and operator priority; this must not exceed 255.)
N
I    TRANSACTION: This attribute is obsolete, but is supported to provide
I      compatibility with earlier releases of CICS.
N
D    USERAREALEN(0 | number)
I      Specifies the length, in bytes, of the user
I      area for this session, in the range 0 through 255. It should be
I      made as small as possible. The terminal user area is initialized
I      to zeros when the session is installed.
N
I      The terminal user area might be located in 31-bit storage or in
I      24-bit storage, depending on the value of the TCTUALOC system
I      initialization parameter. The default is that the terminal user
I      area can be in either 31-bit storage or 24-bit storage, but CICS
I      uses 31-bit storage wherever possible. If you require the terminal
I      user area to be in 24-bit storage, because you have application
I      programs that are not capable of 31-bit addressing, specify the
I      system initialization parameter TCTUALOC=BELOW for the CICS region.
N
D    USERID(userid)
I      Specifies a user identifier used for sign-on
I      (SEC=YES or MIGRATE) and referred to in security error messages,
I      security violation messages, and the audit trail. It must be a
I      valid userid defined to the security manager, or operators will be
I      unable to sign on. All access to protected resources depends on
I      USERID.
N
I      This USERID overrides a SECURITYNAME specified on the CONNECTION
I      definition.
N
I      The name can be up to eight characters in length.
N
NAttributes for APPC sessions:
N-----------------------------
D    MAXIMUM(1,0 | value1,value2)
I      (APPC only): Specifies the maximum
I      number of sessions that are to be supported for the modeset.
I      Value1 must be greater than or equal to value2.
N
I      1|value1: The maximum number of sessions in the group. This value
I        can be in the range 1 through 999. The default is 1.
N
I      0|value2: The maximum number of sessions that are to be supported
I        as contention winners. This value can be in the range 0 to 999.
I        The default is 0. Note that this operand has no meaning for a
I        single session connection.
N
I      SNA allows some resources (for example, switched lines) to be
I      defined in the network as limited resources. At bind time,
I      z/OS Communications Server indicates to CICS whether the bind
I      is over a limited resource. When a CICS task frees a session
I      across a limited resource, CICS unbinds the session if no other
I      task wants to use it.
N
I      If the sessions are to use limited resources, specify
I      MAXIMUM(value1,0). This causes any unbound session to be reset so
I      that either side can then bind it as a winner when it is next
I      required.
N
I      For further information on the effects of the MAXIMUM option, and
I      the use of limited resources, see the CICS Intercommunication
I      Guide.
N
D    MODENAME(modename)
I      (APPC only): Specifies the name that identifies
I      a group of sessions for use on an APPC connection. The name can be
I      up to eight characters in length, and must be the name of a
I      z/OS Communications Server LOGMODE entry defined to
I      z/OS Communications Server. It must not be the reserved name
I      SNASVCMG. If you omit the modename it defaults to blanks. See
I      the CICS Intercommunication Guide for more information about
I      z/OS Communications Server modenames.
N
I      The MODENAME must be unique for each group of sessions defined
I      for any one intersystem link. That is, the MODENAME must be unique
I      among the SESSIONS definitions related to one CONNECTION
I      definition. It is passed to z/OS Communications Server as the
I      LOGMODE name.
N
N
NAttributes for MRO (ISC) and LU61 sessions:
N-------------------------------------------
D    DISCREQ(NO | YES)
I      Specifies whether disconnect requests are to be
I      honored. DISCREQ applies to LUTYPE6.1 ISC sessions, but not to MRO
I      (ISC) sessions where CICS is not dealing with z/OS Communications
I      Server devices.
N
I      DISCREQ does not apply to APPC (LUTYPE6.2) sessions. When APPC is
I      used, individual sessions are acquired as transactions need them,
I      then are subsequently freed. Because it is possible to have
I      multiple sessions between APPC logical units, there should never
I      be a problem of one request holding up another. It is not possible
I      to disconnect an individual APPC session; instead, you can issue
I      a CEMT SET CONNECTION RELEASED command.
N
I      NO: CICS is not to honor a disconnect request for a
I        z/OS Communications Server device.
N
I      YES: CICS is to honor a disconnect request for a
I        z/OS Communications Server device, and issue a
I        z/OS Communications Server CLSDST macro instruction to terminate
I        the z/OS Communications Server session with that logical unit.
N
I        CESF LOGOFF or GOODNIGHT commands issued from the terminal also
I        cause disconnection if you specify DISCREQ(YES).
N
D    IOAREALEN(0,0 | value1,value2)
I      Specifies the length, in bytes, of
I      the terminal input/output area to be used for processing messages
I      transmitted on the MRO (ISC) link.
N
I      value1: value1 specifies the minimum size of a terminal
I        input/output area to be passed to an application program when
I        a RECEIVE command is issued.
N
I      value2: If value2 is not specified, or is less than value1, it
I        defaults to the value of value1.
N
I        You can specify value2 as greater than or equal to value1. In
I        this case, when the size of an input message exceeds value1,
I        CICS uses a terminal input/output area (TIOA) value2 bytes long.
I        When a transaction is attached on an MRO link, CICS uses a TIOA
I        that is long enough to contain the initial input message.
I        Otherwise, if the input message size also exceeds value2, the
I        node abnormal condition program sends an exception response to
I        the terminal.
N
I      You can waste both real and virtual storage by specifying an
I      IOAREALEN value that is too large for most messages transmitted
I      on your MRO link. On the other hand, if you specify an IOAREALEN
I      value that is either zero or smaller than most of your messages,
I      excessive FREEMAIN and GETMAIN activity may occur. This results
I      in additional processor requirements.
N
D    NETNAMEQ(netnameq)
I      Specifies the name by which the remote IMS system knows this
I      particular session. This is used for CICS-IMS sessions. The
I      name can be up to eight characters in length. The acceptable
I      characters are:
I      A-Z 0-9 $ @ # . / - _ % &  ? ! : | " = ¬ , ; < and >.
I      Lowercase characters are converted to uppercase except
I      when using the CREATE command.
N
D    RECEIVECOUNT(number | 1)
I      For  MRO, and z/OS Communications Server LU6.1
I      sessions, and for sessions with EXCI clients, specifies the number
I      of receive sessions; that is, sessions that normally receive before
I      sending:
N
I      -> MRO receive sessions (including sessions with EXCI clients)
I         always receive before sending.
N
I      -> z/OS Communications Server LU6.1 receive sessions normally
I         receive before sending, but may send before receiving when
I         there is a shortage of suitable send sessions.
N
I       If you do not specify the RECEIVECOUNT attribute, there are no
I       receive sessions.
N
I       The number of receive sessions you can specify depends upon the
I       length of the prefix specified in the RECEIVEPFX attribute:
N
I       -> If you use the default receive prefix (<), or your own
I          1-character prefix, you can specify 1 through 999 receive
I          sessions.
N
I       -> If you use a 2-character prefix, you can specify 1 through
I          99 receive sessions.
N
I      You should also ensure that the value specified matches the number
I      of send sessions in the partner system:
N
I      -> If the partner is another CICS system, the value should match
I         the SENDCOUNT specified in the partner system.
N
I      -> If the partner is an EXCI client, you cannot specify the number
I         of send sessions in the partner. However, there is an upper
I         limit of send sessions in an EXCI address space. When this
I         limit is reached, IRP rejects further requests for a session
I         with SYSTEM_ERROR reason code 608. For information about how
I         the limit is specified for the CICS system, see EXCI pipe
I         allocation.
N
D    RECEIVEPFX(< | prefix)
I      Specifies a 1-or 2-character prefix that
I      CICS is to use as the first one or two characters of the receive
I      session names (the names of the terminal control table terminal
I      entries (TCTTEs) for the sessions).
N
I      Prefixes must not cause a conflict with an existing connection or
I      terminal name.
N
N      < (MRO and EXCI sessions)
N      -------------------------
I        For MRO and EXCI sessions, if you do not specify your own
I        receive prefix, CICS enforces the default prefix the less-than
I        symbol (<), which is used in conjunction with the receive count
I        to generate receive session names.
N
I        CICS creates the last three characters of the session names.
I        The acceptable characters are A-Z 1-9. These 3-character
I        identifiers begin with the letters AAA, and continue in ascending
I        sequence until the number of session entries reaches the limit
I        set by the RECEIVECOUNT value. Note that receive session names
I        are generated after the send sessions, and they follow in the
I        same sequence.
N
I        For example, if the last session name generated for the send
I        sessions is >AAJ, using the default sendprefix (>) CICS generates
I        the receive session names as <AAK, <AAL, <AAM, and so on. (This
I        method of generation of session identifiers is the same as for
I        APPC sessions, except for the initial prefix symbol.)
N
I        If you use more than 46656 sessions (<AAA to <999), CICS
I        allocates the next range of AAA< to 999<, again in a similar
I        manner to APPC sessions.
N
I        A region with more than 46656 sessions might not perform well.
I        You should consider the alternative of increasing the number of
I        CICS regions.
N
I        Although you can define up to 93312 MRO sessions there is a
I        current restriction that prevents you from attempting to acquire
I        more than 65535 sessions in one attempt. This might occur when
I        CICS starts or for a CEDA install for more than 65536 sessions
I        if ALL the partner regions are up and running. Further sessions
I        can be acquired later.
N
I        Note: If you specify your own prefix, CICS generates the session
I        names in the same way as it does for LUTYPE6.1 sessions.
N
I      prefix (LUTYPE6.1 sessions): If the sessions are on LUTYPE6.1 ISC
I        connections, you must specify a 1-or 2-character prefix. Do not
I        use the default < symbol for LUTYPE6.1 sessions.
N
I        For LUTYPE6.1 sessions (and MRO if you specify your own 1-or
I        2-character prefix), CICS generates session names by appending
I        a number to the prefix, either in the range 1 through 99, or 1
I        through 999. The number begins with 1 and is incremented by 1
I        until the specified RECEIVECOUNT is reached.
N
D    SENDCOUNT(number | 1)
I      For MRO, and z/OS Communications Server LU6.1
I      sessions only, specifies the number of send sessions; that is,
I      sessions that normally send before receiving:
N
I      -> MRO send sessions always send before receiving
N
I      -> z/OS Communications Server LU6.1 send sessions normally send
I         before receiving, but may receive before sending when there is
I         a shortage of suitable receive sessions
N
I      The number of send sessions you can specify depends upon the length
I      of the prefix specified in the SENDPFX attribute:
N
I        -> If you use the default send prefix (>), or your own
I           1-character prefix, you can specify 1 through 999 send
I           sessions
N
I        -> If you use a 2-character prefix, you can specify 1 through 99
I           send sessions.
N
I       You should also ensure that the value specified matches the
I       number of receive sessions in the partner system:
N
I       -> If the partner is another CICS system, the value should match
I          the RECEIVECOUNT specified in the partner system
N
I       If you do not specify the SENDCOUNT attribute, there are no send
I       sessions. Do not specify the SENDCOUNT attribute when the partner
I       is an EXCI client.
N
D    SENDPFX(> | prefix)
I      Specifies a 1-or 2-character prefix that CICS
I      is to use as the first one or two characters of the send session
I      names (the names of the terminal control table terminal entries
I     (TCTTEs) for the sessions).
N
I      Prefixes must not cause a conflict with an existing connection or
I      terminal name.
N
I      > (MRO sessions): For MRO sessions, if you do not specify your
I        own send prefix, CICS enforces the default prefix the
I        greater-than symbol (>), which is used in conjunction with the
I        send count to generate send session names.
N
I        CICS creates the last three characters of the session names
I        from the alphanumeric characters A through Z, and 1 through 9.
I        These 3-character identifiers begin with the letters AAA, and
I        continue in ascending sequence until the number of session
I        entries reaches the limit set by the SENDCOUNT value.
N
I        For example, using the default prefix (>), CICS generates
I        session names as >AAA, >AAB, >AAC, and so on. If you use more
I        than 46656 sessions (>AAA to >999), CICS allocates the next
I        range of AAA> to 999>. (This method of generation of session
I        identifiers is the same as for APPC sessions, except for the
I        initial symbol.)
N
I        A region with more than 46656 sessions might not perform well.
I        You should consider the alternative of increasing the number of
I        CICS regions.
N
I        Although you can define up to 93312 MRO sessions there is a
I        current restriction that prevents you from attempting to acquire
I        more than 65535 sessions in one attempt. This might occur during
I        CICS start up or for a CEDA install for more than 65536
I        sessions if ALL the partner regions are up and running. Further
I        sessions can be acquired later.
N
I        Note: If you specify your own prefix, CICS generates the session
I        names in the same way as it does for LUTYPE6.1 sessions.
N
I      prefix (for LUTYPE6.1 sessions): If the sessions are on LUTYPE6.1
I        ISC connections, you must specify a 1-or 2-character prefix. Do
I        not use the default > symbol for LUTYPE6.1 sessions.
N
I      For LUTYPE6.1 sessions (and MRO if you specify your own 1-or
I      2-character prefix), CICS generates session names by appending a
I      number to the prefix, either in the range 1 through 99, or 1
I      through 999. The number begins with 1 and are incremented by 1
I      until the specified SENDCOUNT is reached.
N
D    SESSNAME(sessname)
I      Specifies the symbolic identification to be used
I      as the local half of a session qualifier pair in a CICS
I      intercommunication parallel session. The name can be up to four
I      characters in length.
N
NAttributes for EXCI sessions:
N-----------------------------
D    IOAREALEN(0,0 | value1,value2)
I      Specifies the length, in bytes, of
I      the terminal input/output area to be used for processing messages
I      transmitted on the MRO (ISC) link.
N
I      value1: value1 specifies the minimum size of a terminal
I        input/output area to be passed to an application program when
I        a RECEIVE command is issued.
N
I      value2: If value2 is not specified, or is less than value1, it
I        defaults to the value of value1.
N
I        You can specify value2 as greater than or equal to value1. In
I        this case, when the size of an input message exceeds value1,
I        CICS uses a terminal input/output area (TIOA) value2 bytes long.
I        When a transaction is attached on an MRO link, CICS uses a TIOA
I        that is long enough to contain the initial input message.
I        Otherwise, if the input message size also exceeds value2, the
I        node abnormal condition program sends an exception response to
I        the terminal.
N
I      You can waste both real and virtual storage by specifying an
I      IOAREALEN value that is too large for most messages transmitted
I      on your MRO link. On the other hand, if you specify an IOAREALEN
I      value that is either zero or smaller than most of your messages,
I      excessive FREEMAIN and GETMAIN activity may occur. This results
I      in additional processor requirements.
N
D    RECEIVECOUNT(number)
I      For  MRO, and z/OS Communications Server LU6.1
I      sessions, and for sessions with EXCI clients, specifies the number
I      of receive sessions; that is, sessions that normally receive before
I      sending:
N
I      -> MRO receive sessions (including sessions with EXCI clients)
I         always receive before sending.
N
I      -> z/OS Communications Server LU6.1 receive sessions normally
I         receive before sending, but may send before receiving when
I         there is a shortage of suitable send sessions.
N
I       If you do not specify the RECEIVECOUNT attribute, there are no
I       receive sessions.
N
I       The number of receive sessions you can specify depends upon the
I       length of the prefix specified in the RECEIVEPFX attribute:
N
I       -> If you use the default receive prefix (<), or your own
I          1-character prefix, you can specify 1 through 999 receive
I          sessions.
N
I       -> If you use a 2-character prefix, you can specify 1 through
I          99 receive sessions.
N
I      You should also ensure that the value specified matches the number
I      of send sessions in the partner system:
N
I      -> If the partner is another CICS system, the value should match
I         the SENDCOUNT specified in the partner system.
N
I      -> If the partner is an EXCI client, you cannot specify the number
I         of send sessions in the partner. However, there is an upper
I         limit of send sessions in an EXCI address space. When this
I         limit is reached, IRP rejects further requests for a session
I         with SYSTEM_ERROR reason code 608. For information about how
I         the limit is specified for the CICS system, see EXCI pipe
I         allocation.
