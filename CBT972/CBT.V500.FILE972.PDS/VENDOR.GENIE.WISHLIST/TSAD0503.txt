NChapter 5: ABEND dump
N---------------------
NPrinting and viewing dumps
N--------------------------
NYou can print or view the different types of ABEND dumps as follows:
N
NSYSABEND and SYSUDUMP dumps
N---------------------------
N
NThese two dumps are formatted as they are created. They can be:
N
N-> In a SYSOUT data set. The system can print the dump when printing
N   the output class. To view at a terminal, use a facility that allows
N   the viewing of JES SPOOL data sets.
N
N-> On a tape or direct access data set. Print the dump in a separate
N   job or job step or view the dump at a terminal by browsing the data
N   set containing the dump.
N
N   A convenient way to print the dump is in a later job step that runs
N   only if an earlier job step abnormally ends and, thus, requests a
N   dump. For this, use the JCL EXEC statement COND parameter.
N
N-> Sent directly to a printer. Note this is not recommended; the
N   printer cannot be used for anything else while the job step is
N   running, whether a dump is written or not.
N
NExample: Using IEBPTPCH to print a dump
N---------------------------------------
NThe following JCL uses the IEBPTPCH facility to print a formatted dump
Ndata set. In this example, a SYSABEND dump is printed. The same JCL
Ncan be used for a SYSUDUMP. Because the system formats the dump when
Ncreating it, the IEBPTPCH utility program can print the dump.
M
MIn the age of reduced printing, view the data set!
N
NAssume the dump is in a data set named DUMPDS on tape.
N
I//YOURPGM EXEC PGM=ABENDING,...
I//SYSABEND  DD DISP=(NEW,CATLG),DSN=YOURPGM.APPLD.DUMP,
I//             UNIT=TAPE,...
D...
D//PRINT   EXEC PGM=IEBPTPCH,COND=ONLY
D//SYSIN     DD *
D    PRINT PREFORM=A,TYPORG=PS
D/*
D//SYSPRINT  DD SYSOUT=*
D//SYSUT1    DD DISP=OLD,DSN=YOURPGM.APPLD.DUMP
D//SYSUT2    DD SYSOUT=*
N
N
NSYSMDUMP dumps
N--------------
NThis dump is unformatted when created. The system can write the dump
Nto tape or direct access. Use IPCS to format the dump and then view
Nit at a terminal or print it. SYSMDUMP dumps are especially useful for
Ndiagnosing errors because IPCS can produce specific information for
Nspecific requests.
