NSyntax for DEFINE GENERATIONDATAGROUP Parameters
N------------------------------------------------
D  DEFINE /* Abbreviation: DEF */ -
N
NRequired Parameters
N-------------------
D    GENERATIONDATAGROUP( /* Abbreviation: GDG */ -
I      Specifies that a generation data group (GDG) entry is to be
I      defined. A GDG can contain both SMS- and non-SMS-managed
I      generation data sets. A generation data set (GDS) cannot be a
I      VSAM data set. If you create a GDG and its catalog is on an
I      SMS-managed volume, you should remove any dependencies on pattern
I      DSCBs. See z/OS DFSMS Using Data Sets for information about GDGs
I      and GDSs.
N
D      NAME(entryname) -
I        Specifies the name of the GDG being defined.
N
D      LIMIT(limit) /* Abbreviation: LIM */ -
I        Specifies the maximum number, from 1 to 255, of GDSs that can
I        be associated with the GDG being defined.
N
NOptional Parameters
N-------------------
D      EMPTY | NOEMPTY /* Abbreviations: EMP and NEMP */ -
I        Specifies what action is to be taken for the catalog entries
I        for the GDG base when the number of generation data sets in the
I        GDG base is equal to the LIMIT value and another GDS is to be
I        cataloged. The disposition of the actual data sets uncatalogued
I        from the GDG base is determined by the setting of the
I        SCRATCH/NOSCRATCH parameter for the GDG base.
N
I        EMPTY /* Abbreviation: EMP */: remove all GDS entries from GDG
I          base when a new GDS is created that causes the GDG LIMIT to
I          be exceeded.
N
I        NOEMPTY /* Abbreviation: NEMP */: remove only the oldest GDS
I          entry when a new GDS is created that causes GDG LIMIT to be
I          exceeded.
N
D      OWNER(ownerid) -
I        Identifies the generation data set's owner.
N
I        For TSO users, if the owner is not identified with the OWNER
I        parameter, the TSO userid is the default ownerid.
N
D      SCRATCH | NOSCRATCH /* Abbreviations: SCR and NSCR */ -
I        Specifies what action is to be taken for a generation data set
I        located on disk volumes when the data set is uncataloged from
I        the GDG base as a result of EMPTY/NOEMPTY processing. For
I        generation data sets located on tape, this parameter has no
I        effect.
N
I        You can override the SCRATCH|NOSCRATCH attribute when issuing
I        the DELETE command.
N
I        SCRATCH /* Abbreviation: SCR */: The GDS is deleted from all
I          disks it occupies when uncatalogued from the GDG base,
I          regardless of whether it is SMS-managed or not.
N
I        NOSCRATCH /* Abbreviation: NSCR */: If the data set is a
I          non-SMS managed data set it is not removed from any of the
I          volumes it occupies. If the data set is an SMS-managed data
I          set it is recataloged as a non-VSAM data set in rolled-off
I          status, and is no longer associated with the GDG base. It is
I          not deleted from any of the SMS-managed volumes it occupies.
N
D    ) /* - */
M    CATALOG(catname) /* Abbreviation: CAT */
I      Identifies the catalog in which the generation data group is to
I      be defined. If the catalog's volume is physically mounted, it is
I      dynamically allocated. The volume must be mounted as permanently
I      resident or reserved. Search "Catalog Selection Order for DEFINE"
I      for the order in which a catalog is selected when the catalog's
I      name is not specified.
N
I      catname/alias: Names the catalog or an alias that can be resolved
I        to a catalog. For example, if alias ABCD relates to catalog
I         SYS1.USERCAT, then specifying either ABCD or SYS1.USERCAT will
I         cause the cluster to be defined in SYS1.USERCAT.
N
I        If the catalog's volume is physically mounted, it is
I        dynamically allocated. Mount the volume as permanently
I        resident or reserved.
