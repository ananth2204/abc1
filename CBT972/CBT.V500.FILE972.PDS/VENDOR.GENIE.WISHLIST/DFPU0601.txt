NExample 1: Print a Sequential Data Set
N
NIn this example, a sequential data set is printed. The printed output
Nis left-aligned, with one 80-byte record appearing on each line of
Nprinted output.
N
D//PRINT JOB ...
D//ST01#01 EXEC PGM=IEBGENER
D//SYSPRINT  DD SYSOUT=*
D//SYSIN     DD DUMMY
D//SYSUT1    DD DISP=(SHR),DSN=D80.DATA
D//SYSUT2    DD SYSOUT=*
N
NThe job control statements are discussed below:
N
N  SYSIN DD defines a dummy data set. Since no editing is performed, no
N  utility control statements are required.
N
N  SYSUT1 DD defines the input sequential data set.
N
N  SYSUT2 DD indicates that the output is to be written on the system
N  output device (printer). IEBGENER copies LRECL and RECFN from the
N  SYSUT1 data set and the system determines a BLKSIZE.
