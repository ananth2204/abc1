NSyntax for SCHDS Parameters
N---------------------------
D  SCHDS -
N
NRequired Parameters
N-------------------
NSCHDS has no required parameters, but you must specify one of the
Noptional parameters.
N
NOUTFILE is a second optional parameter you can specify.
N
NOptional Parameters
N-------------------
D    CFREPAIR( /* Abbreviation: CFREP */ -
I      Use this command to reconstruct the RLS indicators for all
I      applicable data sets in a restored catalog. The catalog must be
I      import-connected on all systems to the master catalog before the
I      CFREPAIR parameter can be used.
N
D      INFILE(ddname) |
D      INDATASET(dsname) -
N
I        INFILE(ddname): Indicates which DD statement defines the
I          catalog to be processed.
N
I        INDATASET(dsname): Use this to specify the name of the catalog
I          to be processed.
N
D      (LIST | NOLIST) -
I         Optional subparameters, which control the information returned
I         by the CFREPAIR parameter.
N
I          LIST: Requests a list of data sets for which CFREPAIR
I            successfully restored the RLS information. If you do not
I            specify this subparameter, CFREPAIR lists only those data
I            sets whose RLS information could not be restored.
N
I          NOLIST: Only data sets whose information could not be
I            restored are listed. Using this subparameter is the same as
I            not specifying LIST or NOLIST.
D    ) -
N
D    CFREPAIRDS(base_cluster_name | partially_qualified_cluster_name) -
I      Use this command to reconstruct the RLS indicators for all
I      applicable data sets requested after restoring a catalog.
N
I      Note: Be sure to identify all data sets used as RLS data sets.
I      Otherwise, data may be lost.
N
I      base_cluster_name: Specifies the name of the data set to be
I        processed.
N
I      partially_qualified_cluster_name: A list of data sets will be
I        generated using the partially qualified data set name. A
I        partially qualified data set name is specified by appending
I        an asterisk to a partial data set name. CFREPAIRDS lists all
I        data sets processed, not just those with errors.
N
D    CFRESET( /* Abbreviation: CFRES */ -
I      Use this parameter if you've decided to fall back from using
I      VSAM RLS. The CFRESET parameter clears VSAM RLS indicators in
I      the catalog for all applicable data sets. A detailed fallback
I      procedure is included in the z/OS DFSMSdfp Storage
I      Administration. See the z/OS DFSMSdfp Storage Administration for
I      information specific to CICS.
N
I      If the catalog is later restored, use CFREPAIR to reconstruct
I      critical information required by the SMSVSAM server.
N
D      INFILE(ddname) | -
D      INDATASET(dsname) -
N
I        INFILE(ddname): Specifies the data definition (DD) name of the
I          catalog to be processed.
N
I        INDATASET(dsname): Specifies the data set name of the catalog
I          to be processed.
N
D      (LIST | NOLIST)
I        Optional subparameters, which control the information returned
I        by the CFRESET parameter.
N
I        LIST: Requests a list of data sets for which CFRESET
I          successfully processed the RLS indicators. If you do not
I          specify this subparameter, CFRESET lists only those data
I          sets whose indicators were not cleared.
N
I        NOLIST: Only data sets that were not successfully processed
I          are listed. Using this subparameter is the same as not
I          specifying LIST or NOLIST.
N
D    ) -
N
D    CFRESETDS(base_cluster_name | partially_qualified_cluster_name) -
D    /* Abbreviation: CFRDS */ -
I      Use this parameter if you've decided to fall back from using
I      VSAM RLS. It clears VSAM RLS indicators in the catalog for all
I      applicable data sets. CFRESETDS This parameter differs from
I      CFRESET in that it lets you select one or more data sets for
I      fallback.
N
I      base_cluster_name: Specifies the name of the data set to be
I        processed.
N
I      partially_qualified_cluster_name: A list of data sets will be
I        generated using the partially qualified data set name. A
I        partially qualified data set name is specified by appending
I        an asterisk to a partial data set name. CFRESETDS lists all
I        data sets processed, not just those with errors.
N
I      A detailed fallback procedure is included in the z/OS DFSMSdfp
I      Storage Administration. Also, for information specific to CICS,
I      see CICS Recovery and Restart Guide.
N
D    CFQUIRSDS(base_cluster_name | partially_qualified_cluster_name) -
D    /* Abbreviation: CFQDS */ -
I      Use this parameter to turn off the RLS Quiesced indicator in the
I      catalog for all applicable data sets.
N
I      After a data set is quiesced in RLS, the Quiesced indicator in
I      the catalog will be set to indicate the data set is in a quiesced
I      state. RLS access is prevented from the data set until this
I      indicator is reset. This command provides the capability to
I      directly turn off this indicator in the catalog without going
I      through the unquiesce process. Refer to the section on RLS
I      quiesce and unquiesce functions CICS Recovery and Restart Guide
I      for more information.
N
I      base_cluster_name: Specifies the name of the data set to be
I        processed.
N
I      partially_qualified_cluster_name: A list of data sets will be
I        generated using the partially qualified data set name. A
I        partially qualified data set name is specified by appending
I        an asterisk to a partial data set name. CFRESETDS lists all
I        data sets processed, not just those with errors.
N
I      Note that RACF ALTER access is required for any data sets
I      accessed by this command. Access to STGADMIN FACILITY CLASS
I      STGADMIN.IGWSCHDS.REPAIR is not required.
N
D    DENYNONRLSUPDATE(base-cluster) /* Abbreviation: DENY */ -
I      If you inadvertently issue PERMITNONRLSUPDATE, use this parameter
I      to reset the effect of PERMITNONRLSUPDATE.
N
I      If recovery was pending, but you did not run a non-RLS batch job,
I      you must use this parameter. If not reset, CICS takes action
I      assuming the data set has been opened for update in non-RLS mode.
N
I      Do not use DENYNONRLSUPDATE if you do indeed run non-RLS work
I      after specifying PERMITNONRLSUPDATE. The permit status is reset
I      the next time the data set is opened in RLS mode.
N
D    FRSETRR(base-cluster) /* Abbreviation: SETRR */ -
I      This parameter sets the forward-recovery-required indicator.
I      Until reset with the FRRESETRR parameter, access is prevented
I      until forward recovery is complete.
N
I      If you use a forward recovery utility such as CICSVR that
I      supports RLS, DFSMStvs, or both, do not use this parameter.
N
D    FRUNBIND(base-cluster) /* Abbreviation: UNB */ -
I      This parameter unbinds the retained locks prior to restoring or
I      moving the data set. These locks protect uncommitted changes and
I      are needed for eventual backout. They must be rebound by using
I      the FRBIND parameter.
N
I      If you use a forward recovery utility such as CICSVR that
I      supports RLS, DFSMStvs, or both, do not use this parameter.
N
D    FRBIND(base-cluster) /* Abbreviation: BIND */ -
I      Use this parameter after BLDINDEX to rebind the associated locks
I      to the restored data set.
N
I      Attention: Between the unbind and the bind, do not delete any
I      clusters in the sphere or change their names.
N
I      If you use a forward recovery utility such as CICSVR that
I      supports RLS, DFSMStvs, or both, do not use this parameter.
N
D    FRRESETRR(base-cluster) /* Abbreviation: RESET */ -
I      Use this parameter after forward recovery is complete and after
I      locks have been bound to the new location of the data set using
I      FRBIND. This allows access to the newly recovered data set by
I      applications other than the forward recovery application.
N
I      If you use a forward recovery utility such as CICSVR that
I      supports RLS, DFSMStvs, or both, do not use this parameter.
N
D    FRDELETEUNBOUNDLOCKS(base-cluster) /* Abbreviation: DUNBL */ -
I      The FRDELETEUNBOUNDLOCKS parameter lets you delete locks in the
I      rare case when a successful forward recovery is not possible.
I      Every attempt should be made to complete forward recovery,
I      whether using a product such as CICSVR that supports VSAM RLS
I      or using another forward recovery procedure.
N
I      If forward recovery does not successfully complete, locks cannot
I      be reassociated (bound) to the new version of the data set,
I      because these locks do not provide the protection that online
I      backout requires.
N
I      Before using this parameter, check the documentation for your
I      online application. For CICS, the procedure is documented in the
I      CICS Recovery and Restart Guide.
N
D    JOBS -
I      When this keyword is specified, LISTDS returns a list of the jobs
I      currently accessing the data set in DFSMStvs mode.
N
D    LISTALL /* Abbreviation: LALL */ -
I      Lists all information related to recovery for subsystems and
I      VSAM spheres accessed in RLS mode. The output from this parameter
I      can be quite large.
N
D    LISTRECOVERY(base-cluster) /* Abbreviation: LRCVY */ -
I      lists data sets requiring recovery and the subsystems that share
I      those data sets. Recovery indicators listed are:
N
I      -> Lost locks
N
I      -> Retained locks
N
I      -> Non-RLS update permitted
N
I      -> Forward recovery required
N
D    LISTDS(base-cluster) /* Abbreviation: LDS */ -
I      Lists the following information:
N
I      -> The assigned coupling facility cache structure name
N
I      -> The subsystem type and status:
N
I        -> Active for batch
N
I        -> Active or failed for online
N
I      -> Whether the VSAM sphere is recoverable or nonrecoverable
N
I      -> The state of the data set:
N
I        -> Forward recovery required
N
I        -> Retained locks
N
I        -> Lost locks
N
I        -> Locks unbound
N
I        -> Non-RLS update permitted
N
I        -> Permit-first-time switch
N
I        -> Optionally, a list of the jobs accessing the data set using
I           DFSMStvs.
N
D    LISTSHUNTED /* Abbreviation: LSH */ -
D      SPHERE(base-cluster) |
D      URID(urid | ALL) -
I      Lists information about work that was shunted due to an inability
I      to complete a syncpoint (commit or backout) for a given data set
I      or unit of recovery, or for all shunted units of recovery when
I      the ALL keyword is specified. The output includes the following
I      information:
N
I      -> The unit of recovery identifier
N
I      -> The data set name
N
I      -> The job with which the unit of recovery was associated
N
I      -> The step within the job with which the unit of recovery was
I         associated
N
I      -> Whether the unit of recovery will be committed or backed out
I         if it is retried
N
I      Shunting is caused by errors such as the following:
N
I      -> C-FAILED: A commit failed.
N
I      -> B-FAILED: A backout failed.
N
I      -> IO-ERROR: An I/O error occurred on the data set.
N
I      -> DS-FULL: The data set was full; no space on DASD to add
I         records.
N
I      -> IX-FULL: A larger alternate index is required.
N
I      -> LOCK: A failure occurred during an attempt to obtain a lock
I         during backout.
N
I      -> LOG: A log stream became or was made unavailable.
N
I      -> CACHE: A cache structure or connection to it failed.
N
I         This parameter requires that you have UPDATE authority to the
I         data set specified.
N
I      SPHERE: List a data set.
N
I        base-cluster: The data set name.
N
I      URID: List a unit of recovery.
N
I        urid: The unit of recovery identifier
N
I        ALL: List all units of recovery.
N
D    LISTSUBSYS(subsystem | ALL) /* Abbreviation: LSS */ -
I      Lists information about a specific subsystem or all subsystems
I      known to the SMSVSAM server:
N
I      -> Subsystem status
N
I         -> Active for batch
N
I         -> Active or failed for online
N
I      -> A summary showing whether the subsystem's shared data sets
I         have:
N
I         -> Lost locks
N
I         -> Retained locks
N
I         -> Non-RLS update permitted
N
I      For an active subsystem, LISTSUBSYS gives the number of held
I      locks, waiting lock requests, and retained locks. For a failed
I      subsystem, LISTSUBSYS shows the number of retained locks.
N
D    LISTSUBSYSDS(subsystem | ALL) /* Abbreviation: LSSDSL */ -
I      Lists information about a specific subsystem or all subsystems
I      known to the SMSVSAM server, including data sets that it is
I      sharing. For each subsystem, this parameter lists the following
I      information:
N
I      -> Sharing protocol (online or batch)
N
I      -> The status (active or failed)
N
I      -> Recovery information for each shared data set:
N
I         -> Whether it has retained locks owned by this subsystem
N
I         -> Whether it has lost locks owned by this subsystem
N
I         -> Whether there are locks not bound to the data set
N
I         -> If forward recovery is required
N
I         -> If non-RLS update is permitted
N
I         -> The permit-first-time switch setting
N
D    OUTFILE(ddname) /* Abbreviation: OUTDD */ -
I      Specifies a data set, other than the SYSPRINT data set, to
I      receive the output produced by the SCHDS command.
N
I      ddname: identifies the DD statement of the alternate target data
I        set.
N
D    PERMITNONRLSUPDATE(base-cluster) /* Abbreviation: PERMT */ -
I      Allows a data set with pending RLS recovery to be opened for
I      output in non-RLS mode. This command is used when it is necessary
I      to run critical batch updates and RLS recovery cannot first be
I      completed. This is reset the next time the data set is accessed
I      for RLS. If after using PERMITNONRLSUPDATE, you do not run a
I      non-RLS batch job, you must use DENYNONRLSUPDATE to prevent
I      non-RLS updates.
N
D    PURGE -
D      SPHERE(base-cluster) | -
D      URID(urid) -
I      Discards the log entries and releases the associated locks. Use
I      this command when the data set is damaged and cannot be restored
I      to a state where it is consistent with the log entries. For
I      example, it might have been necessary to restore the data set
I      from a backup copy that predates the updates that were made to
I      the data set prior to the failure.
N
I      Recommendation: If any data sets are in a lost locks status, do
I      not issue this command while a DFSMStvs restart is in progress.
I      If any lost locks recovery was not completed for a data set that
I      is being processed by this command, the command does not complete
I      until the DFSMStvs restart completes.
N
I      This parameter requires that you have update authority for the
I      specified data set.
N
D    REMOVESUBSYS(subsystem) /* Abbreviation: RSS */ -
I      Use this parameter to remove any knowledge of recovery owed to
I      SMSVSAM by the named subsystem, including locks protecting
I      uncommitted updates.
N
I      Normally, a failed online application would be restarted so that
I      it can do the required backouts and release locks protecting
I      uncommitted updates. However, sometimes it might be necessary to
I      cold start the online application. For more information about
I      cold starts, see CICS Recovery and Restart Guide.
N
I      Use of this parameter is equivalent to cold starting the named
I      subsystem with respect to the SMSVSAM server. Use REMOVESUBSYS
I      for the rare cases where either there is no intention of ever
I      running the subsystem again or the application's cold start
I      procedures cannot be used. An example of an appropriate use of
I      REMOVESUBSYS would be removing a test system that is no longer
I      needed.
N
I      If the removed subsystem is ever run again, every effort should
I      be made to cold start the subsystem.
N
I      Attention: Use of REMOVESUBSYS can result in loss of data
I      integrity.
N
D    RETRY -
D      SPHERE(base-cluster) |
D      URID(urid)
I      Retries the syncpoint. Use this command when the data set can be
I      restored to a state where it is consistent with the log entries.
I      By consistent, we mean that the data set reflects the state that
I      existed before the time of the particular unit of recovery for
I      which DFSMStvs was unable to complete processing. This is
I      possible for data sets that are forward recoverable or for
I      failures that do not damage the data set (such as a dropped
I      path). When the command completes successfully, locks associated
I      with the log entries are released.
N
I      Recommendation: If any data sets are in a lost locks status, do
I      not issue this command while a DFSMStvs restart is in progress.
I      If any lost locks recovery was not completed for a data set that
I      is being processed by this command, the command does not complete
I      until the DFSMStvs restart completes.
N
I      This parameter requires that you have update authority for the
I      specified data set.
