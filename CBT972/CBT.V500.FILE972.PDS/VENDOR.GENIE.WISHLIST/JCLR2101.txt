MKenneth Tomiak remark:
MItems 1 and 2 above should be one and the same.
M'Programming Using The Kenneth Tomiak Method' (PUTKTM) calls for
Msingle objects in PDS members.

NA throwback to when JCL and data was actually punched on a card. This
Nsignalled when the end of a job was reached and the system could start
Nprocessing it. Eventually the system could tell the end of one job
Nwhen it saw another jobcard. Then when terminals came into vogue,
Nsubmitting from TSO and ISPF will read until the end of file, which
Nsignals the end of a job. So, it is no longer required, wastes disk
Nspace, but lets you keep JCL in the same member which is not processed.
N
NOh yeah, instead of deleting those last steps, just insert an EOJ
Nafter the last statement you want as part of the job, then submit.
NVoila`, the remaining JCL is not submitted and you still have it!
N
NAnd oh by the way, one day you will get burnt by having an extra JOB
NStatement and wind up submitting a job you did not mean to. Stick
Nthat extra crud somewhere else. Control cards are easily moved under
Na separate and unused DD Statement.
* End of wish.
