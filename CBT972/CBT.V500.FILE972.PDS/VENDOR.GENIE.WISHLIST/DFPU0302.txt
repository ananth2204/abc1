NExample 2: Merge Four Data Sets
N
NIn this example, members are copied from three input partitioned data
Nsets (DATASET1, DATASET5, and DATASET6) to an existing output
Npartitioned data set (DATASET2). The sequence in which the control
Nstatements occur controls the manner and sequence in which partitioned
Ndata sets are processed.

NThe control statements are discussed below:
N
N  IN1 DD defines a partitioned data set (DATASET1).
N
N  IN5 DD defines a partitioned data set (DATASET5).
N
N  OUT2 DD defines a partitioned data set (DATASET2).
N
N  IN6 DD defines a partitioned data set (DATASET6). This data set
N  is to be deleted when processing is completed.
N
N  SYSUT3 defines a temporary spill data set.
N
N  SYSIN DD defines the control data set, which follows in the input
N  stream. The data set contains a COPY statement and three INDD
N  statements.
N
N  COPY indicates the start of the copy operation. The OUTDD parameter
N  specifies DATASET2 as the output data set.
M
N  The first INDD statement specifies DATASET1 as the first input data
N  set to be processed. All members (A, B and F) are copied to
N  DATASET2.
N
N  The second INDD statement specifies DATASET6 as the second input
N  data set to be processed.
N  Processing occurs as follows:
N
M  1. Since replacement is not specified, members B and C, which already
M     exist in DATASET2, are not copied to DATASET2.
M
M  2. Member D is copied to DATASET2.
M
M  3. All members in DATASET6 are lost when the data set is deleted.
M
N  The third INDD statement specifies DATASET5 as the third input data
N  set to be processed. No members are copied to DATASET2 because all
N  exist in DATASET2.
* End of wish.
