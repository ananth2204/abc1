NChapter 7: The dump grab bag
N----------------------------
NProblem data from the linkage stack
N-----------------------------------
NThe linkage stack is used to identify a program that requested a system
Nservice, if the service was entered by a branch instruction.
N
NExample: Viewing a linkage stack entry
N--------------------------------------
NTo see the linkage stack entry that is associated with address space
Nidentifier (ASID) X'1A', use the IPCS subcommand:
N
ISUMMARY FORMAT ASID(X'1a')
N
NMany system services are called through branches. For branch entry
Nservices, use register 14 to identify the calling program. Look for
Nthe problem in the calling program.
