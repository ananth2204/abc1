NChapter 28. TCPIPSERVICE resources
N==================================
NA TCPIPSERVICE resource defines which TCP/IP services are to use CICS
Ninternal sockets support.
N
NWith TCPIPSERVICE resources, the CICS services that can be defined are
NECI over TCP/IP (for CICS Clients), CICS web support (HTTP), IPIC, or
Na user-defined protocol. The TCPIPSERVICE definition allows you to
Nmanage these internal CICS interfaces, with CICS listening on multiple
Nports, with different flavors of ECI, CICS web support or the
Nuser-defined protocol on different ports.
N
NTCPIPSERVICE definitions are for use only with the CICS-provided TCP/IP
Nservices, and have nothing to do with the z/OS Communications Server IP
NCICS Sockets interface. The TCP/IP Socket Interface for CICS is
Nsupplied with z/OS Communications Server, which is an integral part of
Nz/OS and does not use the CICS SO domain.
