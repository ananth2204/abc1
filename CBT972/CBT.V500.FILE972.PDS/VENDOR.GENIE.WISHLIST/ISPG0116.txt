N----------------------------------------
NA summary of the ISPF services
N------------------------------
NMiscellaneous services
N----------------------
NCONTROL:  Allows a function to condition ISPF to expect certain kinds
N          of display output, or to control the disposition of errors
N          encountered by dialog management services.
N
NFILESTAT: Provides statistics about a site on the connected
N          workstation.
N
NFILEXFER: Uploads files from the workstation or downloads files to the
N          workstation.
N
NGETMSG:   Obtains a message and related information and stores them in
N          variables specified in the service request.
N
NGRERROR:  Provides access to the address of the GDDM. error record and
N          the address of the GDDM call format descriptor module.
N
NGRINIT:   Initializes the ISPF/ GDDM interface and optionally requests
N          that ISPF define a panel's graphic area as a GDDM graphics
N          field.
N
NGRTERM:   Terminates a previously established GDDM interface.
N
NLIBDEF:   Provides applications with a method of dynamically defining
N          application data element files while in an active ISPF
N          session.
N
NLIST:     Allows a dialog to write data lines directly (without using
N          print commands or utilities) to the ISPF list data set.
N
NLOG:      Allows a function to write a message to the ISPF log file.
N          The user can specify whether the log is to be printed, kept,
N          or deleted when ISPF is terminated.
N
NPQUERY:   Returns information for a specific area on a specific panel.
N          The type, size, and position characteristics associated with
N          the area are returned in variables.
N
NQBASELIB: Enables an ISPF dialog to obtain the current library
N          information for a specified DDNAME.
N
NQLIBDEF:  Allows an ISPF dialog to obtain the current LIBDEF definition
N          information, which can be saved by the dialog and used later
N          to restore any LIBDEF definitions that may have been
N          overlaid.
N
NQTABOPEN: Allows an ISPF dialog to obtain a list of currently open
N          ISPF tables. The TBSTATS or TBQUERY service can then be used
N          to obtain more detailed information about each table.
N
NQUERYENQ: Allows an ISPF dialog to obtain a list of all system
N          enqueues, or all system enqueues that match the specified
N          criteria.
N
NTRANS:    Translates data from one Coded Character Set Identifier
N          (CCSID) to another.
N
NWSCON:    Enables the user to connect to the workstation without using
N          the GUI parameter on the ISPSTART command and the Initiate
N          Workstation Connection panel from the ISPF settings.
N
NWSDISCON: Enables the user to disconnect from the workstation without
N          having to terminate the ISPF session.
