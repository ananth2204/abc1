N------------------------------------------------
NControl statements for PDUU
N---------------------------
NPDUU is managed through the following SYSIN statements with these
Nguidelines:
N
N-> Use an asterisk (*) in the first column to indicate comments.
N
N-> Keywords must start in column one.
N
N-> Use control statements that are in form VERB=OPERAND.
N
N-> Mixed case verbs and operands are allowed.
N
N-> The operand starts in the column after the equal sign and goes to the
N   first blank column except TARGET_SYS, DIRECTORY, CIPHER_KEY, ACCOUNT,
N   USERID, and PASSWORD, which can contain blanks.
N
N-> Anything after the first blank is ignored except for any operands
N   that can contain blanks. In those cases, do not use blanks from
N   column one to the end of the operand.

NKeywords
N--------
N  TARGET_SYS
N    The name of the TCP/IP system to transfer the files to using FTP.
N    One through 64 characters, dotted decimal format is allowed, no
N    default value, can contain blanks, and it must be specified.
N
N    If using a proxy server, this should be the name of the proxy
N    server.
N
N    You can include additional FTP command parameters on the TARGET_SYS
N    parameter by using the z/OS UNIX specifications as shown in the
N    topic FTP command -- Entering the FTP environment in z/OS
N    Communications Server: IP User's Guide and Commands, SC31-8780.
N
N    For example, to trace output (-d) and use a specific
N    ftpdata_filename (-f"//'WES.MYFTP.DATA'"):
N
DTARGET_SYS=-d -f"//'WES.MYFTP.DATA'" testcase.boulder.ibm.com
N
N    Use the -p parameter to specify an alternate IP stack.
N
N  USERID
N    The user ID on the target system that is used to send the files. 1
N    through 64 characters, no default value, does not have to be
N    specified, and can contain imbedded blanks. If USERID and PASSWORD
N    are not supplied and NETRCLEVEL=2, the values from the NETRC data
N    set is used for the FTP sessions.
N
N    If using a proxy server, this can be the full login to the remote
N    system in the format userid@remote.system.name.
N
N  PASSWORD
N    The password for the USERID on the target system. 1 through 64
N    characters and the default value is blanks.
N
N    If using a proxy server, this can be the USERID and PASSWORD for the
N    proxy server in the format userid@password.
N
N  ACCOUNT
N    The account data that is sent when an FTP session is started.
N
N  TARGET_DSN
N    The variable (descriptive) portion for the file names on the target
N    system. 1 through 64 characters, no default value, and it must be
N    specified.
N
N  WORK_DSN
N    The prefix for the data set names of work files on the sending
N    system. 1 through 40 characters, no default value, and it must be
N    specified.
N
N    The work data sets are large format, sequential, data sets and
N    cannot have the compaction attribute.
N
N    Note: Because work files are dynamically allocated with large format
N    and do not support compressed format, if you specify data class for
N    work files with the compaction attribute or N, the following message
N    is issued for all work files:
N
N    IGD17163I COMPRESSION REQUEST NOT HONORED FOR DATA SET
N              work_file_dsname BECAUSE DATA SET CHARACTERISTICS
N              DO NOT MEET COMPRESSION CRITERIA, ALLOCATION CONTINUES
N
N  WORK_DSN_SIZE
N    The maximum size of the work files in megabytes. 1 through 4 decimal
N    digits and the default is 100 MB.
N
N  KEEP_WORK
N    The parameter to save the work data sets that are dynamically
N    allocated for each FTP session. If you omit the KEEP_WORK parameter,
N    the program does not save the work data sets. Y is the only value
N    for the KEEP_WORK parameter.
N
N    Note: Only specify this parameter when debugging a problem.
N
N  DATACLAS
N    The data class to use when allocating the work files on the sending
N    system. 1 through 8 characters with no default value.
N
N  STORCLAS
N    The storage class to use when allocating the work files on the
N    sending system. 1 through 8 characters with no default value.
N
N  CC_FTP
N    The number of parallel FTP sessions to use when transmitting the
N    files. 1 or 2 decimal digits, the value must be between 1 and 20,
N    and the default is 2.
N
N  DIRECTORY
N    The directory on the target system where the files will be sent with
N    FTP. 1 through 32 characters, with no default, can contain blanks,
N    and you must specify the directory.
N
N  PMR
N    The PMR number with which this file is associated. This field must
N    be 13 numeric or uppercase characters, specify in the form
N    xxxxx.yyy.zzz, and define the variables as:
N
N    Field Explanation      Example
N    ----- ---------------- -------
N    XXXXX PMR Number       34143
N    YYY   Branch office    055
N    ZZZ   IBM Country Code 724
N
N  CIPHER_KEY
N    The encryption key to use for 192-bit triple DES encryption. The 24
N    characters following CIPHER_KEY= are used as the key. The key can
N    include imbedded and/or trailing blanks. For example,
N    CIPHER_KEY=HERE IS CIPHER KEY IN 24 or CIPHER_KEY=Shortkey. If you
N    do not specify CIPHER_KEY=, no encryption is performed. If you
N    encrypt the data set using CIPHER_KEY, you must provide IBM with the
N    encryption key so they can perform problem diagnosis.
N
N    Note: If CIPHER_KEY= is followed by 24 blanks, the file will be
N          encrypted with a key of 24 blanks.
* End of wish.
