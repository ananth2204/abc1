NChapter 18: Problem Documentation Upload Utility
N------------------------------------------------
NPlanning to use PDUU
N--------------------
NUse the PDUU as the primary utility for sending large volumes of
Ndocumentation, such as stand-alone dumps, to the IBM FTP site. The
Nencryption capability ensures that the transfer occurs in a secure
NManner. AMATERSE is useful for compressing (packing) and unpacking
Nrelatively small amounts of service data, but is incompatible with PDUU
N(output and input), and offers no data transfer capability. If you have
Npreviously used the PDUU, shipped as the MTFTPS stand-alone program from
Nwww-01.ibm.com/support/docview.wss?uid=isg3T1011823, you must understand
Nthe following changes made to package the PDUU utility as part of z/OS:
N
N-> The PDUU utility name is AMAPDUPL; however MTFTPS ships as an alias
N   entry point to AMAPDUPL.
N
N-> AMAPDUPL resides in SYS1.MIGLIB (which must be a data set in the
N   LNKLST concatenation), so a STEPLIB DDNAME is not necessary to invoke
N   AMAPDUPL.
