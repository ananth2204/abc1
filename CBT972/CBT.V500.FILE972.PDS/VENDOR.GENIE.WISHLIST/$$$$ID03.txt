ISearch in $$$$ID01 or $$$$ID02 to see if the product you want to
Iadd an example for is already defined. If so, please do put some
Ieffort into adding onto it.
I
IHow do you do that? As best as you can with the limited 8 character
Imember name size limit. I prefer trying to use an acronym for the
Iproduct + what type of manual it is documented in + the chapter in
Ithat manual + two characters to make it unique. Using numbers 00 to
I99 yields 100 examples and that is more than many users will want to
Ilook thru. But if you must exceed the 100 member per chapter per
Imanual type per product than first experiment with adding NLS and
Ialphabet characters from the start to get the usual sorting sequence
Ithat places those before pure numbers.
I
IAnd then I hit the Appendix and decided it would be rare to hit 90
Ichapters in one manual and started using 9a, 9b, 9c, etcetera.
I
IAs I looked at sharing some of samples and examples it became apparent
Ithat my lack of an official manual would allow me to use the range
Iof AA - ZZ in place of numbers.
I
IWhen I updated my base WISHLIST set of files I noticed I had examples
Ifor TRSMAIN. There was a time you had to FTP that from IBM in order
Ito use it. Once IBM came to their senses (user requirement?) they
Ichanged the name to AMATERSE and began shipping it as part of MVS.
II found it documented In the "Tools and Service Aids" manual.
IThe IBM KnowledgeCenter is new school, whereas I still like a PDF.
II found iea2v1c2.pdf  GA22-7589-19 and Chapter 17 as the source for
Icompleting member names.
I
IUsing the sample product below:
N  iea TSA Tools and Service Aids - Diagnosis
II took TSA for the product id, went with "D" for diagnosis to now
Ihave TSAD, added 17 for the chapter to yield TSAD17 and added the
Iletter "O" for OLD example, followed by sequencing 01 thru 03. When
Iit was time to populate the examples in the manual I used TSAD17##.
I
IAs I am currently the only one building WISHLIST members for the
Imagic GENIE edit macro there are no conflicts in my member naming
Iefforts.
I
IWhat are those manual types:
M
MA=Application
MC=Commands
MD=Diagnosis
MG=Guide (User's)
MI=Installation
MP=Programming
MR=Reference
MS=Setup and Configuration
MU=Utility
M
I
IPlease avoid the temptation to create new manual types for no good
Ireason. Users will not appreciate your rebellious nature to
ISTANDARDS and CONFORMITY just to express your artistic creativity.
IDo create a new manual type if it can be shown as a de-facto standard
INOT already covered by one of the above.
I
IRather than use a Summary manual if it has an example, track down
Ithe associated Reference manual.
I
IPair your unique 3 character APPL+manual to best spread your material
Iinto user-consumable chunks. The 8 character length of the DSORG=PO
Imember names and quantity of IBM products planned to be included with
Ithe GENIE distributed WISHLIST present a challenge for adding
Icontributions from individuals.
M
M$$$$ is reserved for GENIE as I always wanted the at-one-time
Mhand-edited configuration member, $$$$$$$$, at the top of a member
Mlist. It remains in-use as someone wanting to add their applications
Mwill find instructions under the very first APPL.

* End of wish.
