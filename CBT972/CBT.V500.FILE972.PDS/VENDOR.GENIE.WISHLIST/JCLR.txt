NJob Control Language
NA form of scripting language that asks the operating system
Nto process a sequence (one or more steps) of commands. The
Nbasic trinity of statements are JOB, EXEC, and DD.
N
NThe JOB statement identifies the activity.
N
NThe EXEC step identify the program to be executed using
Nthe PGM= keyword. The PARM= keyword is used to pass parameters
Nto the program.
N
NThe DD statement maps file descriptors (DDNAME) to files (DSNAME).
NSome platforms require the use of parameters to map file names
Nto their file descriptor or hardcode file names in the program.
N The DD statement serves this function with the advantage of
Nkeeping the mapping of file name external to the command.
