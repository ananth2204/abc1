NChapter 7. CONNECTION resources
N===============================
NCONNECTION attributes
N---------------------
NA CONNECTION defines a remote system with which your CICS system
Ncommunicates, using intersystem communication (ISC) or multiregion
Noperation (MRO). ISC uses the APPC or LUTYPE6.1 communication protocol.
NMRO uses the IRC, XM, or XCF/MRO access method.
N
NSee also Chapter 14. IPCONN resources. Like a CONNECTION, an IPCONN
Ndefines a communication link to a remote system, but in this case the
Nconnection uses the TCP/IP protocol.
N
NWhen you define a CONNECTION, you give enough information to identify
Nthe system and specify its basic attributes. You put details in the
NSESSIONS definition about the sessions you use to communicate with
Nthe system. CICS uses the CONNECTION name to identify the other system
Nwhen the definition has been installed. For other CICS systems
Nconnected via MRO, this name is typically the same as that specified
Nin the other CICS system as the SYSIDNT system initialization
Nparameter. For other systems connected via ISC, this name is typically
Nbased on an acronym that describes the location of or the organization
Nthat owns the system (for example, USA1 or IBMC).
N
NThe REMOTESYSTEM name on a TRANSACTION definition, or on a TERMINAL
Ndefinition, can refer to a CONNECTION definition through its CONNECTION
Nname (or to an IPCONN definition through its IPCONN name). These
Nattributes are used for transaction routing.
N
NThe REMOTESYSTEM name on a PROGRAM definition can refer to a CONNECTION
Ndefinition through its CONNECTION name (or to an IPCONN definition
Nthrough its IPCONN name). This attribute is used for distributed
Nprogram link.
N
NThe CONNECTION definition does not name associated SESSIONS.
N
NBefore you start creating definitions for intercommunication resources,
Nsee the CICS Intercommunication Guide for further guidance. There you
Ncan find many useful examples of the attributes you must specify for
Ndifferent types of links and sessions.
