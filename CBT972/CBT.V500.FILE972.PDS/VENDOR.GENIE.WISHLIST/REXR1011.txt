NChapter 10. TSO/E REXX commands
N-------------------------------
NQELEM
N-----
Nqueries the number of data stack elements that are in the most recently
Ncreated data stack buffer (that is, in the buffer that was created by
Nthe MAKEBUF command). The number of elements is returned in the REXX
Nspecial variable RC. When MAKEBUF has not been issued to create a
Nbuffer, QELEM returns the number 0 in the special variable RC,
Nregardless of the number of elements on the data stack. Thus when QBUF
Nreturns 0, QELEM also returns 0.
