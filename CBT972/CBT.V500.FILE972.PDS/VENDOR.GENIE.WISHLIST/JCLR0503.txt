NExample 3: Adding COND= and RD= and then nullify EXPDT=
N-------------------------------------------------------
MKenneth found the IBM example verbose and suggests using
M  IF..THEN/ELSE/ENDIF
Minstead of COND. Plus, other than for testing, the PROC should be
Mbetter written to NOT need overrides when &SYMBOLS may be
Mused instead.
I
IPhysical tape is becoming a rarity and therefore the only
Igood use for EXPDT is to get Catalog Control retention
Ifrom your Tape Management System (TMS). And that should be a
Isystem-level default!
