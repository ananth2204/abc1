NInstructions

NEXIT
N----
NEXIT leaves a program unconditionally. Optionally EXIT returns a
NCharacter string to the caller. The program is stopped immediately,
Neven if an internal routine is currently being run. If no internal
Nroutine is active, RETURN (see page 72) and EXIT are identical in their
Neffect on the program that is being run.
N
NIf you specify expression, it is evaluated and the string resulting
Nfrom the evaluation is passed back to the caller when the program
Nstops.
N
NSyntax:
D  EXIT expression
N
NExample:
N--------
I  j = 3
I  EXIT j * 4
I  /* Will exit with the string "12" */
N
NNote: If the program was called through a command interface, an
Nattempt is made to convert the returned value to a return code
Nacceptable by the host. If the conversion fails, it is deemed to be a
Nfailure of the host interface and thus is not subject to trapping with
NSIGNAL ON SYNTAX. The returned string must be a whole number whose
Nvalue fits in general register 15 (that is, must be in the range
N-2**31 through 2**31-1).
