NExample 8: Renumber and Insert Records into a Library Member
N
NIn this example, two blocks (three logical records per block) are
Ninserted into an existing member, and the member is placed in the
Nexisting partitioned data set. A portion of the output member is also
Nrenumbered.

NThe control statements are discussed below:
N
N  SYSUT1 and SYSUT2 DD define the partitioned data set PDS.
N
N  SYSIN DD defines the control data set, which follows in the input
N  stream.
N
N  The CHANGE function statement identifies the input member RENUM. The
N  entire member is listed in the message data set.
N
N  The NUMBER detail statements specify the insert operations
N  (INSERT=YES) and control the renumbering operation as described
N  below.
N
N  Data statements 1, 2, 3, and 4, 5, 6 are the blocks of logical
N  records to be inserted. Because they contain blank sequence numbers,
N  sequence numbers are assigned when the data statements are inserted.
N
N  Data statement 7, because it contains a sequence number, stops the
N  insert operation. The sequence number is identical to the number on
N  the next record in the old master data set; consequently, data
N  statement 7 will replace the equally numbered old master record in
N  the output data set.
N
N  The existing logical records in this example have sequence numbers
N  AA010, AA015, AA020, AA025, AA030, AA035, AA040, AA045, AA050, BB010,
N  and BB015. The insertion and renumbering operations are performed as
N  follows:
N
N  1. Data statement 1 is assigned sequence number AA020 (NEW1=AA020)
N     and inserted after existing logical record AA015 (SEQ1=AA015).
N  2. Data statements 2 and 3 are assigned sequence numbers AA025 and
N     AA030 (INCR=5) and are inserted after data statement 1.
N  3. Existing logical records AA020, AA025, and AA030 are assigned
N     sequence numbers AA035, AA040, and AA045, respectively.
N  4. Data statement 4 is assigned sequence number AA050 and inserted.
N     (The SEQ1=AA030 specification in the second NUMBER statement
N     places this data statement after existing logical record AA030,
N     which has become logical record AA045.)
N  5. Data statements 5 and 6 are assigned sequence numbers AA055 and
N     AA060 and are inserted after data statement 4.
N  6. Existing logical record AA035 is replaced by data statement 7,
N     which is assigned sequence number AA065.
N  7. The remaining logical records in the member are renumbered until
N     logical record BB010 is encountered. Because this record has a
N     sequence number higher than the next number to be assigned, the
N     renumbering operation is ended.
* End of wish.
