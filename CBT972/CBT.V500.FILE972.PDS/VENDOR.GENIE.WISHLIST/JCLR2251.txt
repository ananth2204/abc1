N====================
NNOTIFY Parameter
N----------------
NUse the NOTIFY parameter to have PSF issue a print completion message
Nto up to four users. The message identifies the output that has
Ncompleted printing, and indicates whether the printing was successful.
NThis parameter is effective for PSF devices and any FSS products that
Nsupport the NOTIFY keyword (such as Infoprint Server); it has no
Neffect for JES-mode devices. The print completion message is issued:
N
N->on a JES2 system: when printing for all the sysout data sets for an
N  output group has completed. An output group consists of the sysout
N  data sets printed between the output header page and the output
N  trailer page of a job.
N
N->on a JES3 system: when the sysout data sets for the same printer
N  and the same job have been printed.

D//outds OUTPUT NOTIFY=Ý,Ýnode¨userid¨
I                 Ýnode¨userid: Specifies the node name and userid
I                   of a recipient of the print completion message.
* End of wish.
