NFCB Parameter
N-------------
NUse the FCB parameter to specify:
N
N->The forms control buffer (FCB) image JES is to use to guide printing
N  of the sysout data set by a 1403 Printer, 3211 Printer, 3203 Printer
N  Model 5, 3800 Printing Subsystem, 4245 Printer, or 4248 Printer, or
N  by a printer supported by systems network architecture (SNA) remote
N  job entry (RJE).
N
N->The page definition member to be used if the data set is line-mode
N  and is printed on a page-mode printer and you do not code PAGEDEF.
N
N->The carriage control tape JES is to use to control printing of the
N  sysout data set by a 1403 Printer or by a printer supported by
N  SNA RJE.
N
N->The data-protection image JES is to use to control output by a
N  3525 Card Punch.
N
N->The name of a page definition to be used by PSF in formatting a
N  print data set.
N
NThe FCB image specifies how many lines are to be printed per inch and
Nthe length of the form. JES loads the image into the printer's forms
Ncontrol buffer. The FCB image is stored in SYS1.IMAGELIB. IBM
Nprovides three standard FCB images:
N
N->STD1, which specifies 6 lines per inch on an 8.5-inch-long form.
N  (3211 and 3203-5 only)
N->STD2, which specifies 6 lines per inch on an 11-inch-long form.
N  (3211 and 3203-5 only)
N->STD3, which specifies 8 lines per inch on an 11-inch form for a dump.
N  (3800 only)
N
D//outds OUTPUT FCB={fcb-name | STD}
I                 fcb-name: Identifies the FCB image. The name is 1
I                   through 4 alphanumeric or national ($, #, @)
I                   characters and is the last characters of a
I                   SYS1.IMAGELIB member name:
I
I                   ->FCB2xxxx member, for a 3211, a 3203 Model 5,
I                     or a printer supported by SNA.
I                   ->FCB3xxxx member, for a 3800.
I                   ->FCB4xxxx member, for a 4248.
I
I                   Identifies a PAGEDEF member in the PSF libraries.
I
I                   STD: Indicates the standard FCB. JES3 uses the
I                     standard FCB specified at JES3 initialization.
I
I                     Note: STD is supported only on JES3 systems.
