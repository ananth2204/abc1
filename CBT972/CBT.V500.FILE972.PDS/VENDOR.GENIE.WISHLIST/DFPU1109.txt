NExample 9: Create a Sequential Data Set from Card Input
N
NIn this example, IEBUPDTE is used to create a sequential data set from
Ncard input. User header and trailer labels, also from the input stream,
Nare placed on this sequential data set.

N
NThe control statements are discussed below:
N
N  SYSUT2 DD defines and allocates space for the output sequential data
N  set, called LABEL, which resides on a disk volume.
N
N  SYSIN DD defines the control data set, which follows in the input
N  stream. (This control data set includes the sequential input data
N  set and the user labels, which are on cards.)
N
N  The first LABEL statement identifies the 80-byte card images in the
N  input stream which will become user header labels. (They can be
N  modified by the user's header-label processing routine specified on
N  the ADD function statement.)
N
N  The ADD function statement indicates that the data statements that
N  follow are placed in the output data set. The newly created data set
N  is listed in the message data set. User output header and output
N  trailer routines are to be given control before the writing of header
N  and trailer labels.
N
N  The second LABEL statement identifies the 80-byte card images in the
N  input stream which will become user trailer labels. (They can be
N  modified by the user's trailer-label processing routine specified on
N  the ADD function statement.)
N
N  ENDUP signals the end of the control data set.
