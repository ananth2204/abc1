NChapter 23. PIPELINE resources
N==============================
NPIPELINE attributes
N-------------------
NDescribes the syntax and attributes of the PIPELINE resource.
N
NSyntax:
N-------
D  DEFINE
D    PIPELINE(name)
I      Specifies the name of this PIPELINE. The name can
I      be up to eight characters in length.
N
D    GROUP(groupname)
I      Every resource definition must have a GROUP name.
I      The resource definition becomes a member of the group and is
I      installed in the CICS system when the group is installed.
N
I      The GROUP name can be up to 8 characters in length. Lowercase
I      characters are treated as uppercase characters.
N
D    DESCRIPTION(text)
I      You can provide a description of the resource that
I      you are defining in this field. The description text can be up to
I      58 characters in length. No restrictions apply to the characters
I      that you can use. However, if you use parentheses, ensure that for
I      each left parenthesis there is a matching right parenthesis. If you
I      use the CREATE command, for each single apostrophe in the text,
I      code two apostrophes.
N
D    CONFIGFILE(name)
I      Specifies the fully qualified or relative name of
I      a z/OS UNIX file that contains information about the processing
I      nodes that will act on a service request, and on the response.
N
I      -> For a configuration file for a PIPELINE resource defined by
I         online resource definition, the file path is either fully
I         qualified, if prefixed with a forward slash (/), or is relative
I         to the HOME directory of the CICS region user ID.
N
I      -> For a configuration file for a PIPELINE resource defined in a
I         CICS bundle, the file path is relative to the root directory
I         of the CICS bundle. The zFS file must be packaged in the CICS
I         bundle with the PIPELINE resource. For more information, see
I         "Referencing zFS artifacts in a bundle".
N
D    RESPWAIT(DEFT | value)
I      Specifies the number of seconds that an
i      application program should wait for a response message from a
I      remote web service. The value can range from 0 to 9999 seconds.
N
I      To use the default timeout value of the transport protocol, specify
I      DEFT. The default timeout value is also used if you do not specify
I      any value for RESPWAIT.
N
I      -> The default timeout value for HTTP is 10 seconds.
N
I      -> The default timeout value for WebSphere MQ is 60 seconds.
N
D    SHELF(/var/cicsts | directory)
I      Specifies the 1-255 character
I      fully-qualified name of a directory (a shelf, primarily for web
I      service binding files) on z/OS UNIX.
N
I      CICS regions into which the PIPELINE definition is installed must
I      have full permissions to the shelf directory read, write, and the
I      ability to create subdirectories.
N
I      A single shelf directory can be shared by multiple CICS regions and
I      by multiple PIPELINE definitions. Within a shelf directory, each
I      CICS region uses a separate subdirectory to keep its files separate
I      from those of other CICS regions. Within each region's directory,
I      each PIPELINE uses a separate subdirectory.
N
I      You should not attempt to modify the contents of a shelf that is
I      referred to by an installed PIPELINE definition. If you do, the
I      effects are unpredictable.
N
I      A PIPELINE resource that is defined in a CICS bundle using CICS
I      Explorer does not use a shelf directory.
N
D    STATUS(ENABLED | DISABLED)
I      Specifies the initial status of the
I      PIPELINE when it is installed:
N
I      ENABLED: Web service requests for this PIPELINE are processed
I        normally.
N
I      DISABLED: Web service requests for this PIPELINE cannot be
I        processed.
N
D    WSDIR(directory)
I      Specifies the 1-255 character fully-qualified
I      name of the web service binding directory (also known as the
I      pickup directory) on z/OS UNIX. Each PIPELINE installed in a CICS
I      region must specify a different web service binding directory.
N
I      The web service binding directory contains web service binding
I      files that are associated with a PIPELINE, and that are to be
I      installed automatically by the CICS scanning mechanism. When the
I      PIPELINE definition is installed, CICS scans the directory and
I      automatically installs any web service binding files it finds
I      there. Note that this happens regardless of whether the PIPELINE
I      is installed in enabled or disabled state.
N
I      If you specify a value for the WSDIR attribute, it must refer to
I      a valid z/OS UNIX directory to which the CICS region has at least
I      read access. If this is not the case, any attempt to install the
I      PIPELINE resource will fail.
N
I      If you do not specify a value for WSDIR, no automatic scan takes
I      place on installation of the PIPELINE.
