NIn its early glory days this program had just the one instruction
Nto branch on register 14. The program always worked and for many
Nyears always provided a return code 0. It broke, it got fixed, and
Npeople continue to use when there may be better ways.
I
IWe would have to agree on how to judge what better is. I cringe at
Iusing DISP=(MOD,DELETE) to create a new data set if one did not already
Iexist in order to get rid of it. And they will needlessly tie up a
Ifew tracks while doing so. If it is being allocated with the same
Iattributes why not jsut IEBGENER a DUMMY data set over it? Or use
IIDCAMS to do the delete if it exists.

MProduction scheduling tools may even do data set cleanup on RESTARTS.
M
MBegging the next question - why not delete after you have finished
Musing it? Again, you selfishy tie up Disk space until the creation
Mjob runs the next time.
