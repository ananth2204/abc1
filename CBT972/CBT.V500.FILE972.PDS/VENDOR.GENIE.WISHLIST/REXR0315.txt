NInstructions

NPROCEDURE
N---------
NPROCEDURE, within an internal routine (subroutine or function),
Nprotects variables by making them unknown to the instructions that
Nfollow it. After a RETURN instruction is processed, the original
Nvariables environment is restored and any variables used in the
Nroutine (that were not exposed) are dropped. (An exposed variable is
None belonging to a caller of a routine that the PROCEDURE instruction
Nhas exposed. When the routine refers to or alters the variable, the
Noriginal (caller's) copy of the variable is used.) An internal routine
Nneed not include a PROCEDURE instruction; in this case the variables
Nit is manipulating are those the caller 'owns.' If used, the PROCEDURE
Ninstruction must be the first instruction processed after the CALL or
Nfunction invocation; that is, it must be the first instruction
Nfollowing the label.

NSyntax:
DPROCEDURE EXPOSE name, ... | (name)
I  EXPOSE: Causes the named variables to be shared between the main
I          code and the subroutine.
N
I    name: A variable name.
N
I   (name): A variable name that contains a subsidiary list of variable
I           names.

NExample
I/* This is the main REXX program */
Ic=11; d=12; e=13; G.e=14
IShowlist = "c d G." /* but not E */
Icall Playvars
Isay "You should see: 11 New 13 9 G. 14"
Isay "               " c d e f G. G.e
Iexit
I/* This is a subroutine */
IPlayvars: Procedure Expose (showlist) f
Isay word(showlist,2) /* Displays "d" */
Isay value(word(showlist,2),'New') /* Displays "12" and sets new value */
Isay value(word(showlist,2)) /* Displays "New" */
Ie=8 /* E is not exposed */
If=9 /* F was explicitly exposed */
Ireturn
* End of wish.
