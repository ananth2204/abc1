NChapter 12: Transaction trace
N-----------------------------
NTransaction trace provides a consolidated trace of key events for the
Nexecution path of application or transaction type work units running in
Na multi-system application environment. By tracing the path of a work
Nunit running in a single system, or (more importantly) across systems
Nin a sysplex environment, that is being processed by multi-system
Ntransaction servers, subsystem interfaces, and resource managers,
Ntransaction trace enables a system programmer to debug problems in those
Nenvironments.
N
NThe essential task of transaction trace is to aggregate data showing the
Nflow of work between components in the sysplex that combine to service
Na transaction. Transaction trace traces events such as component entry,
Nexit, exceptions and major events such as COMMIT, and ROLLBACK. Do not
Nuse transaction trace as a component tracing facility.
