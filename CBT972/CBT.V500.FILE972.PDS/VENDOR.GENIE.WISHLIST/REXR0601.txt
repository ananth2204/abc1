NChapter 6. Numbers and arithmetic
N---------------------------------
NIntroduction
N------------
NNumbers (that is, character strings used as input to REXX arithmetic
Noperations and built-in functions) can be expressed very flexibly.
NLeading and trailing blanks are permitted, and exponential notation
Ncan be used.
N
NVery large numbers
N------------------
NIn exponential notation, a number includes an exponent, a power of ten
Nby which the number is multiplied before use. The exponent indicates
Nhow the decimal point is shifted. Thus, in the preceding examples,
N4E9 is simply a short way of writing 4000000000, and 0.73e-7 is short
Nfor 0.000000073.

NArithmetic operators
N--------------------
NThe arithmetic operators include addition (+), subtraction (-),
Nmultiplication (*), power (**), division (/), prefix plus (+), and
Nprefix minus (-). In addition, there are two further division
Noperators: integer divide (%) divides and returns the integer part;
Nremainder (//) divides and returns the remainder.
