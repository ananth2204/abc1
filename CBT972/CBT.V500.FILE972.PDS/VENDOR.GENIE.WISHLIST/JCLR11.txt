NCNTL Statement
N==============
NUse the CNTL statement to mark the beginning of program control
Nstatements in the input stream. Program control statements
Nspecify control information for a subsystem. The program control
Nstatements are ended by an ENDCNTL statement and are called a
NCNTL/ENDCNTL group.
N
D//label CNTL Ý * comments¨
N
NThe CNTL statement consists of the characters // in columns 1
Nand 2 and four fields:
N->label,
N->operation (CNTL),
N->parameter (*), and
N->comments.
IThe * parameter is required only when comments follow.

MKenenth E. Tomiak remark:
IThe only subsystem mentioned in this chapter is Print Services
IFacility (PSF). And there is where the only JCL Statement not
Idocumented in the JCL Reference is located. Considering that
Ithe CNTL/PRINTDEV/ENDCNTL set of statements are all related,
Iit is IBM's territorial division of support that led to hiding
Ithe PRINTDEV in some other manual but left CNTL/ENDCNTL here.
M
MThe right answer is to put ALL of the JCL Statements in the JCL
MReference. Allow the different groups to work together. No
Mreason to fix that problem now, the number of installations
Mdoing actual printing has dwindled and it is improbable a
Mnew installation needing to code PRINDEV will pop up.
* End of wish.
