N    Group(groupname): specifies the name of the group to be added. The
N                    name must not already exist in the list. A generic
N                    group name is not accepted.
N
N    LIst(listname): specifies the name of the list to which the group
N                    is to be added. If the list does not already exist,
N                    a new one is created. A generic list name is not
N                    accepted.
N
N    After(groupname2): specify AFTER to place the new group name after
N                       the existing group name. The group name is added
N                       at the end of the list if BEFORE or AFTER is not
N                       specified.
N
N    Before(groupname3): specify BEFORE to place the new group name
N                        before the existing group name. The group name
N                        is added at the end of the list if BEFORE or
N                        AFTER is not specified.
