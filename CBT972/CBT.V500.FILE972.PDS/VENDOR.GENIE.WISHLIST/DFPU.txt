NNote-1:
NIBM was wise enough to add IEBPDSE in alphabetic sequence. But
Nwhy keep IEBISAM six (6) releases after support was dropped?
NMy 2017 resurrection to work on the WISHLIST led me to
Nresequence my WISH members. Fortunately I am reviewing z/OS V1R13
Nmanuals before migrating wishes to a mainframe PDS and the
Naddition is not that disruptive. It would have been nicer had
NIBM just swapped IEBPDSE into the IEBISAM spot.
