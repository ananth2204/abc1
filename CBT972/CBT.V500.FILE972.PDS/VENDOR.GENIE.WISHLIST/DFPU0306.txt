NExample 6: Multiple Copy Operations with One Output Data Set
N
NIn this example, members are selected, excluded, and copied from input
Npartitioned data sets onto an output partitioned data set. This example
Nis designed to illustrate multiple copy operations.
N
NThe example follows.

NThe control statements are discussed below:
N
N  INOUTA DD defines a partitioned data, DATASETA, which contains seven
N  members (MA, MB, MC, MD, ME, MF and MG).
N
N  INB DD defines a partitioned data set, DATASETB, which contains two
N  members (MA and MJ).
N
N  INC DD defines a partitioned data set,
N  DATASETC, which contains four members (MF, ML, MM and MN).
N
N  IND DD defines a partitioned data set, DATASETD, which contains two
N  members (MM and MP).
N
N  INE DD defines a partitioned data set, DATASETE, which contains four
N  members (MD, ME, MF and MT).
N
N  OUTX DD defines a partitioned data set (DATASETX). This data set is
N  new and is to be kept after the copy operation. Three tracks are
N  allocated for the data set on a disk volume. Two blocks are allocated
N  for directory entries.
N
N  SYSUT3 defines a temporary spill data set.
N
N  SYSIN DD defines the control data set, which follows in the input
N  stream. The data set contains two COPY statements, several INDD
N  statements, a SELECT statement, and an EXCLUDE statement.
N
N  The first COPY statement indicates the start of the first copy
N  operation. This copy operation is done to create a backup copy of
N  DATASETA.
N
N  The second COPY statement indicates the start of another copy
N  operation. Since DATASETA is specified in both the INDD and OUTDD
N  parameters, DATASETA is compressed in place. The output data set is
N  compressed in place first to save space because it is known that it
N  contains embedded, unused space.
N
N  The following INDD statement specifies DATASETB as the next input
N  data set to be copied. Only member MJ is copied, because DATASETA
N  already contains a member named "MA".
N
N  The third COPY statement indicates the start of the third copy
N  operation. The OUTDD parameter specifies DATASETA as the output data
N  set. This copy operation contains more than one copy step.
N
N  The first INDD statement specifies DATASETD as the first input data
N  set to be processed. Only member MP is copied to DATASETA because
N  the EXCLUDE statement specifies that member MM is to be excluded
N  from the first copy step within this copy operation.
N
N  The second INDD statement marks the beginning of the second copy
N  step for this copy operation and specifies DATASETC as the second
N  input data set to be processed. The SELECT statement specifies that
N  member ML of DATASETC is to be renamed "MD", and that the new member
N  will replace any member in DATASETA that happens to be named "MD".
N  Member ML is searched for, found, copied to DATASETA and renamed.
N
N  The third INDD statement marks the beginning of the third copy step
N  for this copy operation and specifies DATASETE as the last data set
N  to be copied. Only member MT is copied, because DATASETA already
N  contains the other members. Because the INDD statement is not
N  followed by an EXCLUDE or SELECT statement, a full copy is
N  performed.
