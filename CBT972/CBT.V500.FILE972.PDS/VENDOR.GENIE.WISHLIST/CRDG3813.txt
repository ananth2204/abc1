NChapter 38. The resource definition batch utility DFHCSDUP
N==========================================================
NInvoking DFHCSDUP as a batch program
N------------------------------------
NThe DFHCSDUP APPEND command
N---------------------------
NAdd the groups in one list to the end of another list.
N
NNo duplicate group names are allowed in a list. If DFHCSDUP finds any
Nduplicate names during the APPEND operation it ignores them, and they
Nare not appended. The DFHCSDUP output listing contains a warning
Nmessage if this happens.
N
NSyntax
N------
D  APpend FRomcsd ( ddname ) LIst ( listname1 ) To ( listname2 )
N
NOptions
N-------
N    FRomcsd(ddname): specifies the ddname of the secondary CSD file
N                     from which you are appending listname1.
N
N    List(listname1): specifies the name of the list that is appended.
N                     Do not use a generic list name. The list being
N                     appended can be on the primary CSD file, or on
N                     another CSD file. If you are appending from
N                     another CSD file, you must identify it by
N                     specifying the FROMCSD parameter.
N
N    To(listname2): specifies the name of the list to which you want
N                   the group names appended. If you are appending from
N                   another CSD file, you can give this list the same
N                   name as the one you are appending from. Do not use
N                   a generic list name. If this target list already
N                   exists, the source list is appended to the end of
N                   it. If the target list does not exist, it is
N                   created. (In effect, you are copying the source
N                   list.)
* End of wish.
