NExample 5: Copy and Compare Sequential Data Set in Two Job Steps
N
NIn this example, a sequential disk or tape data set is copied and
Ncompared in two job steps.
N
D//TAPETAPE JOB ...
D//ST01#02 EXEC PGM=IEBGENER
D//SYSPRINT  DD SYSOUT=*
D//SYSUT1    DD DISP=(OLD,PASS),DSN=WAREHOUS.COPYSET1
D//SYSUT2    DD DISP=(,PASS),DSN=WAREHOUS.COPYSET2,
D//             UNIT=tape,LABEL=(,SL),
D//             DCB=(RECFM=FB,LRECL=80,BLKSIZE=640)
D//SYSIN     DD DUMMY
D//*
D//ST02#02 EXEC PGM=IEBCOMPR
D//SYSPRINT  DD SYSOUT=*
D//SYSUT1    DD DISP=(OLD,KEEP),DSN=*.STEPA.SYSUT1
D//SYSUT2    DD DISP=(OLD,KEEP),DSN=*.STEPA.SYSUT2
D//SYSIN     DD DUMMY
N
NThe first job step copies the data set and passes the original and
Ncopied data sets to the second job step. The second job step compares
Nthe two data sets.
N
NThe control statements for the IEBCOMPR job step are discussed below:
N
N  SYSUT1 DD defines an input data set passed from the preceding job
N  step (COPYSET1). The data set resides on a labeled tape volume.
N
N  SYSUT2 DD defines an input data set passed from the preceding job
N  step (COPYSET2). The data set, which was created in the preceding
N  job step, resides on a labeled tape volume.
N
N  SYSIN DD defines a dummy control data set. Because the input is
N  sequential and no user exits are provided, no utility control
N  statements are required.
* End of wish.
