NChapter 9. DB2ENTRY resources
N=============================
NDB2ENTRY attributes
N-------------------
NDescribes the syntax and attributes of the DB2ENTRY resource.
N
NSyntax:
N-------
D  DEFINE
D    DB2ENTRY(name)
I      One to eight character name to identify a DB2 entry
I      definition.
N
D    GROUP(groupname)
I      Every resource definition must have a GROUP name.
I      The resource definition becomes a member of the group and is
I      installed in the CICS system when the group is installed.
N
I      The GROUP name can be up to 8 characters in length. Lowercase
I      characters are treated as uppercase characters.
N
D    DESCRIPTION(text)
I      You can provide a description of the resource
I      that you are defining in this field. The description text can be
I      up to 58 characters in length. No restrictions apply to the
I      characters that you can use. However, if you use parentheses,
I      ensure that for each left parenthesis there is a matching right
I      parenthesis. If you use the CREATE command, for each single
I      apostrophe in the text, code two apostrophes.
N
NThread selection attributes
N---------------------------
NDescribes the attributes of the DB2ENTRY resource that relate to
Nthread selection.
N
D    TRANSID(transaction)
I      Specifies the transaction id associated with
I      the entry. Only one transaction can be specified here. However,
I      the use of one or more wildcard characters in the TRANSID (* and +)
I      allows a group of transactions to be represented. Additional
I      transactions can be defined for this DB2ENTRY by defining a
I      DB2TRAN that refers to this DB2ENTRY.
N
I      Transid is optional on a DB2ENTRY. All transactions can be
I      associated with a DB2ENTRY by means of DB2TRAN definition instead.
I      However, if only one transaction is associated with a DB2ENTRY, it
I      is easier to specify it on the DB2ENTRY.
N
I      Note: Specifying a transaction id here causes an implicit DB2TRAN
I      object to be created when the DB2ENTRY definition is installed.
I      The implicit DBTRAN will have a name DFH concatenated with the
I      transaction id specified. These implicit DB2TRANs will appear on
I      CICS and CPSM views of DB2TRAN resources. If a DB2ENTRY is altered
I      to specify a different transid, when the DB2ENTRY is reinstalled
I      the previous implicit DB2TRAN will be deleted and a new implicit
I      DB2TRAN created representing the new transid associated with the
I      DB2ENTRY.
N
NThread operation attributes
N---------------------------
NDescribes the attributes of the DB2ENTRY resource that relate to thread
Noperations.
N
D    ACCOUNTREC(NONE | UOW | TASK | TXID)
I      Specifies the minimum amount of
I      DB2 accounting required for transactions using this DB2 entry. The
I      specified minimum might be exceeded, as described in the following
I      options.
N
I      NONE: No accounting records are required for transactions using
I        threads from this DB2ENTRY
N
I        However, DB2 produces at least one accounting record for each
I        thread after the thread is terminated. Authorization changes
I        additionally cause records to be produced.
N
I      TASK: The CICS DB2 attachment facility causes a minimum of one
I        accounting record for each CICS task to be produced.
N
I        A transaction that contains multiple units of work (UOWs), and
I        in which the threads are released at sync point, can use a
I        different thread for each of its UOWs. As a result, an accounting
I        record might be produced for each UOW.
N
I      TXID: The CICS DB2 attachment facility causes an accounting record
I        to be produced when the transid using the thread changes.
N
I        This option applies to DB2 entry definitions that are used by
I        more than one transaction ID. As threads are typically released
I        at syncpoint, a transaction containing multiple UOWs might use
I        a different thread for each UOW. As a result, an accounting
I        record might be produced for each UOW.
N
I      UOW: The CICS DB2 attachment facility causes an accounting to be
I        produced for each UOW, assuming that the thread is released at
I        the end of the UOW.
N
D    AUTHID(userid)
I      Specifies the user ID that is used for security
I      checking when using this DB2ENTRY.
N
I      Do not specify AUTHID if you are using RACF for some or all of the
I      security checking in your DB2 address space; use AUTHTYPE instead,
I      with the GROUP, SIGN, or USERID options. You must use AUTHTYPE
I      because threads using an AUTHID do not pass the required RACF
I      access control environment element.
N
D    AUTHTYPE(USERID | GROUP | SIGN | TERM  | TX | OPID)
I      Specifies the type of
I      ID that can be used for security checking when using this DB2ENTRY.
N
I      If you are using RACF for some or all of the security checking in
I      your DB2 address space, use the GROUP, SIGN, or USERID options. You
I      must use one of these options because only threads defined with
I      these options pass the required RACF access control environment
I      element (ACEE) to DB2. However, if you specify the SIGN option, the
I      ACEE is passed to DB2 only if the value specified for the SIGNID
I      attribute on the DB2CONN definition matches the CICS region user ID.
N
I      The ACEE is not required if you are using DB2 internal security
I      only; so in this case, you can use any of the options.
N
I      USERID: The USERID associated with the CICS transaction is used as
I        the authorization ID. If the user ID is less than 8 characters
I        in length, it is padded on the right with blanks.
N
I        When the DB2 sample sign-on exit DSN3@SGN is used with
I        AUTHTYPE(USERID), the exit sends the user ID to DB2 as the
I        primary authorization ID and the connected group name to DB2 as
I        the secondary ID. When the sample sign-on exit is used,
I        AUTHTYPE(USERID) and AUTHTYPE(GROUP) are the same.
N
I      GROUP: Specifies the 1- to 8-character USERID and the connected
I        group name as the authorization ID. The following table shows how
I        these two values are interpreted by DB2.
N
I        To use the GROUP option, you must specify SEC=YES in the system
I        initialization parameters for the region.
N
I        If no RACF group ID is available for this USERID, an 8-character
I        field of blanks is passed to DB2 as the group ID.
N
I      SIGN: Specifies that the SIGNID attribute of the DB2CONN is used as
I        the resource authorization ID.
N
I      TERM: Specifies the terminal identification (4 characters padded to
I        8) as an authorization ID. An authorization ID cannot be obtained
I        in this manner if a terminal is not connected with the
I        transaction.
N
I        If a transaction is started, using a CICS command, and has no
I        terminal associated with it do not use AUTHTYPE(TERM).
N
I      TX: Specifies the transaction identification as the authorization
I        ID. The 4-character transaction identification is padded on the
I        right with blanks to form the 8-character authorization ID.
N
I      OPID: The operator identification that is associated with the
I        userid that is associated with the CICS transaction sign-on
I        facility is used as the authorization ID. The 3-character
I        operator identification is padded on the right with blanks to
I        form the 8-character authorization ID.
N
D    DROLLBACK(YES | NO)
I      Specifies whether the CICS DB2 attachment
I      facility initiates a SYNCPOINT ROLLBACK in the event of a
I      transaction being selected as victim of a deadlock resolution.
N
I      YES: The attachment facility initiates a SYNCPOINT ROLLBACK before
I        returning control to the application. An SQL return code of -911
I        is returned to the program.
N
I        Do not specify YES if the DB2ENTRY is used by transactions
I        running enterprise beans as part of an OTS transaction;
I        SYNCPOINT ROLLBACK is not allowed in an OTS transaction.
N
I      NO: The attachment facility does not to initiate rollback for this
I        transaction.
N
I        An SQL return code of -913 is returned to the application.
N
D    PLAN(plan)
I      Specifies the name of the plan to be used for this entry.
N
D    PLANEXITNAME(DSNCUEXT | exit)
I      Specifies the name of the dynamic plan
I      exit to be used for this DB2 entry definition. If you change PLAN
I      and PLANEXITNAME while there are active transactions for the DB2
I      entry definition, the next time the transaction releases the
I      thread, the new values are applied.
N
D    PRIORITY(HIGH | EQUAL | LOW)
I      Specifies the priority of the thread TCBs
I      for this DB2ENTRY relative to the CICS main TCB (QR TCB).If CICS is
I      connected to DB2 Version 6 or later, the thread TCBs are CICS open
I      L8 TCBs.
N
I      HIGH: Thread TCBs have a higher priority than the CICS QR TCB.
N
I      EQUAL: Thread TCBs have equal priority with the CICS QR TCB.
N
I      LOW: Thread TCBs have a lesser priority than the CICS QR TCB.
N
D    PROTECTNUM(0 | value)
I      Specifies the maximum number of protected
I      threads allowed for this DB2 entry definition. A thread that is
I      released by a transaction when no other work is queued can be
I      protected, meaning that it is does not end immediately. A protected
I      thread ends after two complete purge cycles if it has not been
I      reused in the meantime. For example, if the purge cycle is set to
I      30 seconds, a protected thread ends 30 - 60 seconds after it is
I      released if it is not reused in the meantime. The first purge cycle
I      after the CICS DB2 attachment facility has been started is 5
I      minutes, after which the PURGECYCLE value is applied.
N
I      Threads are protected only while they are inactive. If a
I      transaction reuses a protected thread, the thread becomes active,
I      and the current number of protected threads is decremented.
N
D    THREADLIMIT(0 | value)
I      Specifies the maximum number of threads for
I      this DB2 entry definition that the CICS DB2 attachment allows
I      active before requests are made to wait, are abended, or diverted
I      to the pool.
N
D    THREADWAIT(POOL | YES | NO)
I      Specifies whether transactions wait for a
I      DB2ENTRY thread, end abnormally, or overflow to the pool if the
I      number of active DB2ENTRY threads reaches the THREADLIMIT number.
N
I      POOL: If all threads are busy, the transaction is diverted to use
I        the pool of threads. If the pool is also busy, and you specified
I        THREADWAIT(NO) on the DB2 connection definition, the transaction
I        ends abnormally with abend code AD3T.
N
I      NO: If all threads are busy, the transaction ends abnormally with
I        abend AD2P.
N
I      YES: If all threads are busy, the transaction waits until a thread
I        becomes available.
