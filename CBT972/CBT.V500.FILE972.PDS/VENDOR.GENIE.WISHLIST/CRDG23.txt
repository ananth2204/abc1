NChapter 23. PIPELINE resources
N==============================
NA PIPELINE resource is used when a CICS application is in the role of
Na web service provider or requester. It provides information about the
Nmessage handler programs that act on a service request and on the
Nresponse. Typically, a single PIPELINE definition defines an
Ninfrastructure that can be used by many applications.
N
NThe information about the processing nodes is supplied indirectly:
Nthe PIPELINE specifies the name of a z/OS UNIX file containing an XML
Ndescription of the nodes and their configuration.
N
NAn inbound web service request (that is, a request by which a client
Ninvokes a web service in CICS) is associated with a PIPELINE resource
Nby the URIMAP resource. The URIMAP identifies the PIPELINE resource
Nthat applies to the URI associated with the request; the PIPELINE
Nspecifies the processing that is to be performed on the message.
