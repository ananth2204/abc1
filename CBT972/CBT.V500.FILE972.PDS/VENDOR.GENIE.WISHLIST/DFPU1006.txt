NExample 6: Print Three Record Groups
N
NIn this example, three record groups are printed. A user routine is
Nprovided to manipulate output records before they are printed.
M
MNo user routines (EXITS) were ever provided. IBM merely shows how
Myou would invoke it.

N
NThe control statements are discussed below:
N
N  SYSUT1 DD defines the input data set, called SEQDS. The data set
N  resides on a disk volume.
N
N  SYSUT2 DD defines the output data set on the system output device
N  (printer assumed).
N
N  SYSIN DD defines the control data set, which follows in the input
N  stream.
N
N  The PRINT statement:
N
N  1. Initializes the print operation.
N  2. Indicates that not more than nine FIELD parameters are included
N     in subsequent RECORD statements (MAXFLDS=9).
N  3. Indicates that not more than nine IDENT parameters are included
N     in subsequent RECORD statements (MAXGPS=9).
N  4. Indicates that not more than 23 literal characters are included
N     in subsequent IDENT parameters (MAXLITS=23).
N  5. Indicates that processing is ended after 32767 records are
N     processed or after the third record group is processed, whichever
N     comes first. Because MAXLINE is omitted, 60 lines are printed on
N     each page.
N
N  TITLE specifies two titles, to be printed on one line. The titles
N  are not converted to hexadecimal.
N
N  EXITS specifies the name of a user routine (NEWTIME), which is used
N  to manipulate output records before they are printed.
N
N  The first RECORD statement defines the first record group to be
N  processed and indicates where information from the input records is
N  placed in the output records. Positions 1 through 8 of the input
N  records appear in positions 10 through 17 of the printed output, and
N  positions 9 through 38 are printed in hexadecimal representation and
N  placed in positions 20 through 79.
N
N  The second RECORD statement defines the second group to be
N  processed. The parameter in the IDENT operand specifies that an
N  input record last record edited according to the FIELD operand in
N  this RECORD statement. The FIELD operand specifies that positions 1
N  through 8 of the input records are placed in positions 10 through 17
N  of the printed output, and positions 9 through 38 are printed in
N  hexadecimal representation and appear in positions 20 through 79.
N
N  The third and last RECORD statement is equal to the first RECORD
N  statement. An input record that meets the parameter in the IDENT
N  operand ends processing, unless the STOPAFT parameter in the PRINT
N  statement has not already done so.
N
N  LABELS specifies that all user header or trailer labels are to be
N  printed regardless of any return code, except 16, issued by the
N  user's exit routine. It also indicates that the labels are converted
N  from alphanumeric to hexadecimal representation (CONV=XE).
