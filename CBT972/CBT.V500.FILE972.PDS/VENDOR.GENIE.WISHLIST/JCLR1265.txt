NDD Statement
N============
NRLS Parameter
N-------------
NYou can, on a system that includes MVS/DFSMS Version 1 Release 3 or
Nhigher, use the RLS parameter to specify the level of record sharing,
Nor sharing protocol, for a VSAM data set containing records that
Nmust be shared. See z/OS DFSMS Using Data Sets for a description of
Nthe sharing protocols and to determine whether your application can
Nrun in a shared data environment without modification.
N
INIote: RLS is most useful for an existing application. For a new or
Iheavily-modified application, you can request record-level sharing
Iin application code and do not need to specify RLS on the DD statement.
N
D//             RLS= {NRI} | {CR} | {CRE}
I                 NRI: Specifies "no read integrity" (NRI). The
I                      application can read all records. Use this
I                      subparameter if the application can read
I                      uncommitted changes made to a data set by
I                      another application. NRI provides better
I                      performance than the CR subparameter because
I                      it avoids the overhead of obtaining a lock
I                      when reading a record from the data set.
I                 CR:  Specifies "consistent read" (CR). This
I                      subparameter requests VSAM to obtain a SHARE
I                      lock on each record the application reads.
I                      This ensures the application will not read
I                      uncommitted changes made to a data set by
I                      another application. VSAM obtains the lock
I                      while processing a GET NUP request, and
I                      releases the lock before completing the GET
I                      request. An application that processes a data
I                      set allocated with RLS=CR may require
I                      modification if it tries to read changes to
I                      the data set.
I                 CRE: Specifies "consistent read explicit" (CRE).
I                      This subparameter requests serialization of the
I                      record access with update or erase of the
I                      record by another unit of recovery. CRE read
I                      provides the application a means of ensuring
I                      that records read by a unit of recovery are not
I                      changed by other units of recovery until the
I                      reading unit of recovery issues a syncpoint.

NExample 1: EquivalenT of DISP=SHR.
N----------------------------------
NWhen the program BATCHPRG opens DD1, the data set is to be processed
Nas a shared resource. NRI specifies that an application can read
Nuncommitted changes made by other applications.
N
D//ST01#01 EXEC PGM=BATCHPRG
D//DD1       DD DISP=SHR,DSN=A,RLS=NRI
N
NExample 2: Commited (consistent) read of records.
N-------------------------------------------------
NWhen the program BATCHPRG opens DD2, the data set is to be processed
Nas a shared resource. CR specifies that an application can read only
Ncommitted changes made by other applications.
N
D//ST01#01 EXEC PGM=BATCHPRG
D//DD2       DD DISP=SHR,DSN=B,RLS=CR
