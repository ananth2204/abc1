N======================
NChapter 15: AMBLIST
N-------------------
NObtaining AMBLIST output
N------------------------
NTo obtain AMBLIST output, you must code JCL or use the UNIX System
NServices amblist command.
N
N
NSpecifying the JCL statements
N-----------------------------
NGenerally, the minimum partition or region for running AMBLIST is
N64 kilobytes for all functions except LISTLPA, which requires
N100 kilobytes. However, for large load modules, IBM recommends a
Nminimum region size of 200 kilobytes. For program objects, IBM
Nrecommends a minimum region size of 12 megabytes.
N
N
NExample: Listing an object module
N---------------------------------
NIn this example, AMBLIST is used to format and list an object module
Nincluded in the input stream.
N
D//LSTOBJDK JOB MSGLEVEL=(1,1)
D//ST01#01 EXEC PGM=AMBLIST,REGION=64K
D//SYSIN     DD *
D        LISTOBJ DDN=OBJMOD,
D        TITLE=('OBJECT MODULE LISTING FOR MYJOB',25)
D/*
D//SYSPRINT  DD SYSOUT=*
D//OBJMOD    DD *
Dobject module SHOULD BE PLACED HERE
D/*
D//*
N
N
NControlling AMBLIST processing
N------------------------------
NYou control AMBLIST processing by supplying one or more control
Nstatements in the input stream. Code the control statement that applies
Nto the data you want to obtain according to the following rules:
N
N-> Leave column 1 blank, unless you want to supply an optional symbolic
N   name. A symbolic name is analogous to the label name in a program.
N   The maximum length of a symbolic name is eight characters. A symbolic
N   name must end with one or more blanks.
N
N-> If a complete control statement will not fit on a single line, end
N   the first line with a comma or a non-blank character in column 72
N   and continue on the next line. Begin all continuation statements in
N   columns 2 - 16. Do not split parameters between two lines. The only
N   exceptions are the MEMBER parameters, which you can split at any
N   internal comma.
N
NLISTLOAD control statement
N--------------------------
NUse the LISTLOAD control statement to obtain a listing of load module or
Nprogram objects. The listed data can help you verify why certain
Nlink-edit errors might have occurred.
N
NLISTOBJ control statement
N-------------------------
NUse the LISTOBJ control statement to obtain listings of selected object
Nmodules. LISTOBJ supports traditional object modules as well as object
Nmodules in XOBJ or GOFF format.
N
NLISTIDR control statement
N-------------------------
NUse the LISTIDR control statement to obtain listings of selected CSECT
Nidentification records (IDR). AMBLIST also supports the LISTIDR control
Nstatement for program objects in z/OS UNIX System Services files.
N
N
NLISTLPA control statement
N-------------------------
NUse the LISTLPA control statement to obtain listings of selected modules
Nin the fixed link pack area (LPA).
