IDo you want your Rexx code to run faster? Do you want to syntax check
Iyour code fully before you run it? Do you want to protect your
Iintellectual property? If you answered 'YES' to any of these questions,
Ithen this session is for you. This session will show you how to use the
IRexx compiler in VM and TSO environments. We will discuss performance
Ienhancements, programming considerations, optimization and optimization
Istoppers when using the Rexx compiler. If you want to know when to use

Iour session, too!
