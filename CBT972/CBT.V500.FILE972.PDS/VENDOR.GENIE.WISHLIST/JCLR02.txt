NJob Control Tasks
N=================
NFor your program to execute on the computer and perform the work you
Ndesigned it to do, your program must be processed by your operating
Nsystem.
N
NYour operating system consists of an MVS base control program (BCP)
Nwith a job entry subsystem (JES2 or JES3) and DFSMSdfp installed with it.
N
NFor the operating system to process a program, programmers must
Nperform certain job control tasks. These tasks are performed through the
Njob control statements, which consist of:
N
N->JCL statements
N->JES2 control statements
N->JES3 control statements
