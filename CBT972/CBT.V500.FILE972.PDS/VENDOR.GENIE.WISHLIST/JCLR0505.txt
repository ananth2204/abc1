NExample 5: Nested procedures overrides
N--------------------------------------
MSince Kenneth believes you would be an idiot to nest
Mprocedures and then further aggravate the KISS principle by
Mwanting (or worse 'needing') overrides that he has omitted
Mthe IBM example from the wishes.
I
IIf you look at the IBM manual and the alternative you quickly see
Ihow avoiding the PROC invocations is much easier to maintain.
* End of wish.
