NChapter 31. TRANCLASS resources
N===============================
NTRANCLASS attributes
N--------------------
NDescribes the syntax and attributes of the TRANCLASS resource.
N
NSyntax:
N-------
D  DEFINE
D    TRANCLASS(name)
I      Specifies the name of the transaction class.
I      Transactions belonging to a transaction class are subject to
I      scheduling constraints before they are allowed to execute. The
I      reserved TRANCLASS name DFHTCL00 is used to indicate that the
I      transaction does not belong to any transaction class.
N
I      For compatibility with releases that support a TCLASS attribute,
I      CICS provides the following TRANCLASS equivalents:
N
I      TCLASS TRANCLASS
I      ------ ---------
I      NO   DFHTCL00
I      1    DFHTCL01
I      2    DFHTCL02
I      3    DFHTCL03
I      4    DFHTCL04
I      5    DFHTCL05
I      6    DFHTCL06
I      7    DFHTCL07
I      8    DFHTCL08
I      9    DFHTCL09
I      10   DFHTCL10
N
I      Sample definitions for these transaction classes are in group
I      DFHTCL, supplied as part of DFHLIST.
N
I      Note: If a transaction is run and its associated TRANCLASS
I      definition is not installed, the transaction runs without any of
I      the scheduling constraints specified in the TRANCLASS. Attention
I      message DFHXM0212 is issued.
N
I      TRANCLASS can be up to eight characters in length.
N
D    GROUP(groupname)
I      Every resource definition must have a GROUP name.
I      The resource definition becomes a member of the group and is
I      installed in the CICS system when the group is installed.
N
I      The GROUP name can be up to 8 characters in length. Lowercase
I      characters are treated as uppercase characters.
N
D    DESCRIPTION(text)
I      You can provide a description of the resource that
I      you are defining in this field. The description text can be up to
I      58 characters in length. No restrictions apply to the characters
I      that you can use. However, if you use parentheses, ensure that for
I      each left parenthesis there is a matching right parenthesis. If you
I      use the CREATE command, for each single apostrophe in the text,
I      code two apostrophes.
N
D    MAXACTIVE(number)
I      Specifies the maximum number of transactions in
I      this transaction class that are allowed to be active. You must
I      specify a MAXACTIVE value when you define a transaction class, in
I      the range 0 through 999.
N
I      New transactions attached when the number of active transactions
I      has reached the MAXACTIVE limit are considered for queueing
I      subject to the PURGETHRESH limit.
N
I      Defining a transaction class with a zero MAXACTIVE value signifies
I      that all tasks are to be queued.
N
D    PURGETHRESH(NO | number)
I      This is an optional purge threshold for
I      the transaction class; it defines a threshold number at which
I      transactions queuing for membership of the transaction class are
I      purged. Specify it if you want to limit the number of transactions
I      queueing in this transaction class. It can have the following
I      values:
N
I      NO: The size of the queue is unlimited (other than by the storage
I        available to attach tasks).
N
I      number: The purge threshold number in the range 1-1000000.
N
I        If you specify this as 1, no transactions are allowed to
I        queue. If you specify it as any other number (n), the size of
I        the queue is restricted to number-1. All new transactions
I        attached after the limit of n-1 is reached are purged.
N
I      Example of PURGETHRESH: In the case of a transaction class where the
I      maximum number of active tasks (MAXACTIVE) is set to 50, and the
I      purge threshold (PURGETHRESH) is set to 10 to limit queuing
I      transactions, CICS begins to abend new transactions for the class
I      when:
N
I      -> The number of active transactions reaches 50, and
N
I      -> The number of transactions queuing for membership of the
I         transaction class has reached 9
N
I      CICS accepts new transactions for this transaction class queue
I      only when the number queued falls below the maximum size of the
I      queue (9 in our example).
