NExample 3: Create Output Records from Utility Control Statements
N
NIn this example, output records are created entirely from utility
Ncontrol statements. Three fields are created and used in the
Nconstruction of the output records. In two of the fields, alphabetic
Ndata is truncated; the other field is a numeric field that is
Nincremented (indexed) by one after each output record is written.

NThe control statements are discussed below:
N
N  SEQOUT DD defines the test output data set. Ten tracks of primary
N  space and ten tracks of secondary space are allocated for the
N  sequential data set on a disk volume.
N
N  SYSIN DD defines the control data set, which follows in the input
N  stream.
N
N  DSD marks the beginning of a set of utility control statements and
N  refers to the DD statement defining the output data set.
N
N  FD defines the contents of three fields to be used in the
N  construction of output records. The first field contains 30 bytes of
N  alphabetic data to be truncated left after each output record is
N  written. The second field contains 30 bytes of alphabetic data to be
N  truncated right after each output record is written. The third field
N  is a 10-byte field containing a packed decimal number (1234567890)
N  to be increased by one after each record is written.
N
N  CREATE constructs 100 output records in which the contents of
N  previously defined fields (FIELD1, FIELD2, and FIELD3) are included.
N  Note that after each record is written, FIELD1 and FIELD2 are
N  restored to full width.
N
N  END signals the end of a set of utility control statements.
* End of wish.
