NDefinition

NExponential notation
N--------------------
NFor both large and small numbers some form of exponential notation is
Nuseful, both to make long numbers more readable, and to make execution
Npossible in extreme cases. In addition, exponential notation is used
Nwhenever the "simple" form would give misleading information.
N
NThe definition of numbers is, therefore, extended as:
D  blanks sign blanks digits | digits. | digits.digits | .digits +
D    E sign integer blanks
N
I    blanks: are one or more spaces
N
I    sign: is either + or -
N
I    digits: are one or more of the decimal digits 0-9.
N
I    e | E: The E can be in uppercase or lowercase.
N
I    integer: following the E represents a power of ten that is to be
I             applied to the number.
N
NNotation
N--------
NScientific notation is a form of exponential notation that adjusts the
Npower of ten so a single nonzero digit appears to the left of the
Ndecimal point. Engineering notation is a form of exponential notation
Nin which from one to three digits (but not simply 0) appear before the
Ndecimal point, and the power of ten is always expressed as a multiple
Nf three. The integer part may, therefore, range from 1 through 999.
NYou can control whether Scientific or Engineering notation is used
Nwith the instruction:
N
N   NUMERIC FORM SCIENTIFIC | ENGINEERING | expression VALUE
