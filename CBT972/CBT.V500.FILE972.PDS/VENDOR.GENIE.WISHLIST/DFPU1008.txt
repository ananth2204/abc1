NExample 8: Print Directory of a Partitioned Data Set
N
NIn this example, the directory of a partitioned data set is printed
Naccording to the default format. The printed output is converted to
Nhexadecimal.

NThe control statements are discussed below:
N
N  SYSUT1 DD defines the input data set (the partitioned directory),
N  which resides on a disk volume. The DCB keywords describe the
N  directory, not the member contents.
N
N  SYSUT2 DD defines the output data set on the system output device
N  (printer assumed).
N
N  SYSIN DD defines the control data set, which follows in the input
N  stream.
N
N  PRINT begins the print operation, indicates that the partitioned
N  directory is organized sequentially, and specifies conversion from
N  alphanumeric to hexadecimal representation.
N
N  The first TITLE statement specifies a title, and the second TITLE
N  statement specifies a subtitle. Neither title is converted to
N  hexadecimal.
N
N  LABELS specifies that no user labels are printed.
N
I  Note: Not all of the bytes in a directory block need to contain data
I  pertaining to the partitioned data set. Unused bytes are sometimes
I  used by the operating system as temporary work areas. With
I  conversion to hexadecimal representation, the first four characters
I  of printed output indicate how many bytes of the 256-byte block
I  pertain to the partitioned data set. Any unused bytes occur in the
I  latter portion of the directory block. They are not interspersed
I  with the used bytes.
* End of wish.
