NJCLLIB Statement
N================
NUse the JCLLIB statement to:
N
N->Identify the names of the private libraries that the system uses
N  for the job. The system searches the libraries for:
N
N  ->Procedures named on any EXEC statements
N
N  ->Groups of JCL statements (called INCLUDE groups) named on any
N    INCLUDE statements.
N
N->Identify the names of the system procedure libraries and
N  installation-defined procedure libraries that the system uses for
N  the job.
N
N->Identify the order in which the libraries are to be searched. The
N  system searches the libraries in the order in which you specify
N  them on the JCLLIB statement, prior to searching any unspecified
N  default system procedure libraries.
N
NThe JCLLIB statement allows you to code and use procedures and INCLUDE
Ngroups in a private library without the need to use system procedure
Nlibraries.
N
NYou can code only one JCLLIB statement per job.

NConsiderations for an APPC Scheduling Environment
N-------------------------------------------------
NIn an APPC environment, see the information about scheduler JCL for
NITP profiles in z/OS MVS Planning: APPC/MVS Management.
I
IConsiderations for JES3
I-----------------------
IIn a JES3 environment, the system on which the job is submitted
Iand/or converted must have access to any libraries named on the
IJCLLIB statement.
N
D//Ýid¨  JCLLIB ORDER=(libraryÝ,library¨...) Ýcomments¨
N
NThe JCLLIB statement consists of the characters // in columns 1
Nand 2 and four fields:
N->name,
N->operation (JCLLIB), keyword parameter (ORDER), and comments.
