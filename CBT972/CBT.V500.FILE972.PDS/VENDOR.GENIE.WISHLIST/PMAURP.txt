NAhh, the failure of using the generate job on the SMP/E
Noption 6 path is that it adds EVERY FREAKING ALLOCATED DATASET
Nallocated to your ISPF session instead of JUST WHAT IT NEEDS.
N
NYou can tailor data set names in these jobs to not try and
Nwade through all the data sets you might have allocated.
N
NKudos to those shops that learned to strip down the TSO/E logon
NPROCedure and not stuff them in a startup clist/REXX program.
NThat leaves allocating (LIBDEF) on the fly for product specific
Ninvocations at the wiser installations. Yes, I know the trade-offs
Nbehind your opinion over allocating is best for you. That is why
NI carefully construct the LOGON sequence to favor those tools most
Noften used and relegate rarely used tools to LIBDEF.
M
MUse them, or not, makes no difference to me. I have been known to use
Mthe SMP/E Dialog Option 6 path to generate the control cards I then
Mcut and paste into my JCL.
