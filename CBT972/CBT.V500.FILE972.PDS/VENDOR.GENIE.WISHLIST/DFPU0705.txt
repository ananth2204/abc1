NExample 5: Replace the 3800 Forms Control Buffer Module STD3
N
N3800 Model 1
N
NIn this example, an FCB module is defined that uses ISO paper sizes,
Nreplacing the IBM-supplied module named STD3. This must be done before
Nthe dump-formatting routines that print high-density dumps can print
Nthem at 8 lines per inch on that printer.

N
NThe control statements are discussed below:
N
N  The SYSUT1 DD statement includes DISP=OLD to ensure that no other
N  job can modify the data set while this job is executing.
N
N  CH1=1 specifies channel 1 code for printable line 1; CH12=88
N  specifies channel 12 code for line 88.
N
N  LPI=(8,88) specifies that all 88 printable lines of the form are to
N  be at a vertical spacing of 8 lines per inch.
N
N  SIZE=120 specifies that the length of the form is 120 tenths of an
N  inch, or 12 inches, which is the longest ISO paper size.
N
N  The name of the new FCB module is STD3; it is to replace the
N  existing module of that same name on SYS1.IMAGELIB.
* End of wish.
