NChapter 2: TransactionC dump
N----------------------------
NPlanning data set management for SVC dumps
N------------------------------------------
N
NUsing preallocated dump data sets
N---------------------------------
NTo specify a pre-allocated data set, specify the DDNAME parameter that
Nidentifies a data set. The data set must contain sufficient space in
None for more extents for the entire dump to be written. DDNAME does
Nnot have a 2GB size restriction for the size of the dump. If the data
Nset does not contain sufficient space, a partial dump is returned.
N
NSetting up allocation authority
N-------------------------------
NTo allocate dump data sets automatically, the DUMPSRV address space
Nmust have authority to allocate new data sets. Do the following:
N1. Associate the DUMPSRV address space with a user ID. Use the RACF.
N   STARTED general resource class or the RACF Started Procedures Table,
N   ICHRIN03, to associate DUMPSRV with a user id.
N
N2. Authorize DUMPSRV's user ID to create new dump data sets using the
N   naming convention in the following topic. With the high-level
N   qualifier of SYS1, the data sets are considered group data sets.
N   You can assign CREATE group authority to the DUMPSRV user ID within
N   that group.
N
NConfiguration
N-------------
NTo verify dump status issue the DISPLAY DUMP,STATUS command.
DD DUMP,STATUS
NTo see DUMP options issue the DISPLAY DUMP,OPTIONS command.
DDISPLAY DUMP,OPTIONS
N
NEstablishing a name pattern
N---------------------------
IA set of symbols is available so that you can include the following
Ikinds of information in the names of your automatically allocated
Idump data sets:
I
I-> System name
I-> Sysplex name
I-> Job name
I-> Local and GMT time and date
I-> Dump section number
N
NUse the DISPLAY SYMBOLS command to display the current static system
Nsymbols and their associated substitution texts.

MMessage from Kenneth E. Tomiak:
MNowhere did I find the date and time symbols documented.
M
NOne example of a pattern:
N
N1. hlq.TDUMP.D&DATE..T&TIME..&SYSNAME..&DS
I   &SYSNAME. does not start with a numeric.
N2. hlq.TDUMP.D&YYMMDD..T&HHMMSS..S&SYSNAME..&DS
I   &SYSNAME. starts with a numeric AND is less than 8 characters.
N3. hlq.TDUMP.D&YYMMDD..T&HHMMSS..S&SYSNAME(2&colon.8)..&DS
I   &SYSNAME. starts with a numeric AND is 8 characters.
I   Note: In a SYSPLEX this could resolve to the same name if
I         you only vary the last character.
M
MFictiously, let us believe we used:
Mhlq.TDUMP.D&DATE..T&TIME..&SYSNAME..&JOBNAME.
Mand that it resolved to:
Mhlq.TDUMP.D170827.T072155.cbt1.KTOMIAKJ
* End of wish.
