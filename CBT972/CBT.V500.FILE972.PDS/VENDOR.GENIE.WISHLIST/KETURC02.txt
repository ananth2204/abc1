NKenneth Tomiak Utility - IEFBR14:
NExample 2: Allocate a new data set before the step that opens it.
N
N IEFBR14 has been used for years as a way to run a program that
N should not abend. It allowed people to allocate new datasets,
N conditionally managing a dataset, and even delete a dataset.
N
M It makes more sense to me to allocate the new dataset
M in the step you use it in. There you can code RLSE:
M //     space=(typ,(pri,sec,dirblks),RLSE)
M which frees unused space when you close/free the data set.
