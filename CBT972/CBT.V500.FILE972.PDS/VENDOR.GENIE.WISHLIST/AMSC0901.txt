NRequired parameters
N-------------------
D    LIBRARYENTRY( /* Abbreviation: LIBENTRY or LIBENT */ -

I        Specifies the scratch volume message threshold. When the number
I        of scratch volumes in the tape library falls below the scratch
I        threshold, an operator action message, requesting that scratch
I        volumes be entered into the tape library, is issued to the

I        twice the scratch threshold, the message is removed from the
I        console.
N
I        We recommend the use of ISMF panels to make library definition
I        changes, but if you use IDCAMS, make sure that the total slots
I        number defined is greater than the highest scratch threshold
I        you will need. If you issue a
I        ALTER libname LIBENTRY SCRATCHTHRESHOLD(MEDIAx(num))
I        command and receive the following system message IDC31903I in
I        response, the total slots defined are not high enough:
N
M      IDC31903I NUMBERSCRATCHVOLUMES IS GREATER THAN AVAILABLE VOLUMES
N
I        Do the following to set the total slots higher than the scratch
I        threshold:
N
I          ALTER libname LIBENTRY NUMBERSLOTS(num+1)
N
I        followed immediately by:
N
I          ALTER libname LIBENTRY SCRATCHTHRESHOLD(MEDIAx(num))
