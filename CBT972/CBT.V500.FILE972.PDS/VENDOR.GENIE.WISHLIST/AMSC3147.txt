N--------------------------
NCase 17: Migrating Simplex Volume
N---------------------------------
NThe following procedure is used to migrate simplex volumes, that is,
Nvolumes that are not already part of a duplex pair. This procedure is
Nvalid for any two devices qualified to be part of a duplex pair.
N
N1. Vary the target secondary volume offline to all attached systems.
N
N2. Issue SETCACHE SETSECONDARY.
N
N3. After the copy completes, issue SETCACHE SUSPENDPRIMARY.
N
N4. Issue SETCACHE RESETTOSIMPLEX.
N
N5. The original device is no longer in use. The application continues
N   to access the same UCB (MVS device address), but is using a
N   different physical device.
N
N6. Proceed with required activities. Use ICKDSF to change the volser
N   if required.
N
NNote: When you use dual copy to migrate from 3390 devices to RAMAC
Ndevices, an invalid format 4 DSCB is created on the target device. Use
NICKDSF to fix the format 4 DSCB. See your IBM representative for the
Nlatest service level of ICKDSF that provides this function.
N
NIf DASD fast write was active before this procedure was executed, it
Nremains active after the procedure completes.
N
N1. Before the duplex pair is established, the channel connection
N   address (CCA), which is known to MVS, and the director to device
N   connection (DDC) address, which is the physical address known
N   within the subsystem, are the same as when initialized.
N
N2. After creating the duplex pair, both addresses directly correlate.
N
N3. When SETCACHE SUSPENDPRIMARY is issued, the Storage Control swaps
N   the CCA-to-DDC assignments between the primary and the secondary
N   volumes.
N
N4. The system application continues to use the UCB for device 201.
N   However, the Storage Control directs the I/O to the physical device
N   addressed by DDC 12 (the target volume). The UCB for the offline
N   device 212 still points to CCA 12, but the Storage Control points
N   CCA 12 to the suspended device (DDC 01).
N
N5. When SETCACHE RESETTOSIMPLEX is issued, the Storage Control
N   maintains the swapped CCA-to-DDC pointers.
