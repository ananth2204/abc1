N==========================================================
NInvoking DFHCSDUP as a batch program
N------------------------------------
NThe DFHCSDUP UPGRADE command
N----------------------------
NCarry out maintenance to your CSD file.

N
NOptions
N-------
N    Replace: Specify the REPLACE option when you need to rerun the
N             UPGRADE command (for example, because of a previous
N             issue).
N
N    USing(filename): To install IBM features onto CICS, specify
N                     UPGRADE USING(filename). For example, UPGRADE
N                     USING(DFHRDJPN) is used to place the double-byte
N                     character set feature definitions onto the CSD
N                     file.
N
N                     To upgrade a CSD, do not specify the USING
N                     operand. All IBM-supplied definitions from any
N                     release are deleted and then the CSD file is
N                     initialized, so you do not need to say which
N                     release you came from.
* End of wish.
