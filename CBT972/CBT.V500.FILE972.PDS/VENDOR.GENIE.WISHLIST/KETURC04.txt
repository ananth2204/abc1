NKenneth Tomiak Utility - IEFBR14:
NExample 4: MOD,DELETE because you failed to delete a data set
Nafter its last use.
N
M
M With the advent of System Managed Storage as a discipline in the 1980's
M there came better and safer ways of managing datasets. Since there is
M no good reason to use IEFBR14 to allocate a dataset with a
M DISP=(MOD,DELETE) just to delete it if it did exist, you should go look
M at the AMSU members for the better way.
N
N Stop complaining about slow performance if you are using this method.
N You are forcing the system to do I/O on a disk volume to allocate a
N dataset and then turn around and do I/O to delete the dataset.
N That is not efficient.
N
N See the AMSU members for a cleaner way to delete a data set.
