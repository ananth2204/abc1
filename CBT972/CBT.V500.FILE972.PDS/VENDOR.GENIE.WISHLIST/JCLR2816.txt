NJES3 Control Statement
N======================
NJECL //*MAIN Statement
N----------------------
NUse the //*MAIN statement to define the processor requirements for the
Ncurrent job. Many of the parameters are used to override parameters on
Nthe JES3 STANDARDS initialization statement.
N
D//*MAIN {,parameter}

I
I    BYTES=: Specifies the maximum number
I      of bytes of data to be spooled from this job's sysout data sets
I      and the action to be taken if the maximum is exceeded.
I      {({nnnnnn}{,WARNING}{,mmm})}
I      {({nnnnnn}{,W}{,mmm}) }
I      {({nnnnnn}{,CANCEL}) }

I        number of additional bytes between warning messages.
I      CANCEL or C: If the maximum is exceeded, requests that JES3
I        cancel the job.
I      DUMP or D: If the maximum is exceeded, requests that JES3 cancel
I        the job and ask for a storage dump.
I
I    CARDS=: Specifies the maximum number
I      of cards to be punched from this job's sysout data sets and the
I      action to be taken if the maximum is exceeded.
I      {({nnnn}{,WARNING}{,mmm})}
I      {({nnnn}{,W}{,mmm}) }
I      {({nnnn}{,CANCEL}) }

I      CANCEL or C: If the maximum is exceeded, requests that JES3
I        cancel the job.
I      DUMP or D: If the maximum is exceeded, requests that JES3 cancel
I        the job and ask for a storage dump.
I
I    CLASS=class-name

I        1 through 8 characters.
I
I    DEADLINE= {(time,type{,date}) }: Specifies when the job is
I      required.
I    {(time,type{,rel,cycle})}
I      time: Specifies the deadline time, expressed as one of the
I        following:
I
I        nM The job is to be scheduled within n minutes. n is 1 through
I          4 numbers from 0 through 1440.

I        hhhh: The job is to be scheduled by the time of day, hhhh, in
I          24-hour clock time (0800 is 8:00 a.m.). hhhh is from 0000
I          (start of the day) through 2400 (end of the day).
I
I      type: Identifies the deadline algorithm. The deadline algorithm
I        is defined by the installation, controls how the job's
I        priority is increased, and is one character:
I        A through Z or 0 through 9. If the specified algorithm is not
I        defined, JES3 abnormally terminates the job.
I
I      date: Specifies the date, in one of the following formats, when
I        the time parameter takes effect.
I
I        mm/dd/yyyy: where mm is the month (01-12), dd the day (01-31),
I          and yyyy the 4-digit year (for example, 2017). Leading
I          zeroes are required in the day and month fields.
I
I      rel: Specifies on which day within a cycle the deadline falls.
I        rel is 1 through 3 numbers from 1 through 366. The value of
I        rel depends on the specified cycle, as follows:
I
I        cycle: Specifies the length of a cycle. cycle is coded as
I          WEEKLY, MONTHLY, or YEARLY.
I
I          ->WEEKLY: Sunday is day 1; Saturday is day 7. If rel is
I            greater than 7, it defaults to 7.
I
I          ->MONTHLY: Day 1 is the first day of the month. Days
I            29, 30, and 31 are treated as the last day of the month.
I            If rel is greater than 31, it defaults to 31.
I
I          ->YEARLY: Day 1 is January 1; day 365 is December 31, for
I            non-leap years, and day 366 is December 31, for leap
I            years. If rel is greater than 365, it defaults to 365
I            for non-leap years or 366 for leap years.
I
I    EXPDTCHK= {YES | NO}
I      Indicates whether or not JES3 is to perform expiration date
I      checking for scratch output tape volumes with IBM standard
I      labels (SL).
I
I      YES: Requests expiration date checking. Tape volumes premounted
I        for SL scratch requests must have expired dates.
I
I      NO: Requests that expiration dates not be checked.
I
I    FAILURE=:Indicates the job recovery option to be used if the
I      system fails. If you do not code a FAILURE parameter on the
I      //*MAIN statement, JES3 assigns the job the default failure
I      option, which is defined during JES3 initialization for
I      each job class. (See also the RD parameter on the JOB
I      statement.)
I
I      {RESTART}: Requests that JES3 restart the job when the failing
I        processor is restarted. Do not specify RESTART for jobs that
I        use the DEQ at DEMOUNT facility for tape volumes.
I
I      {CANCEL }: Requests that JES3 print the job and then cancel
I        the job.
I
I      {HOLD }: Requests that JES3 hold the job for restart.
I
I      {PRINT }: Requests that JES3 print the job and then hold the
I        job for restart.
I
I    FETCH=: Determines the fetch messages that will be issued to the
I      operator for disk and tape volumes for this job.
I
I      {ALL }: Requests that JES3 issue fetch messages to the operator
I        for all removable volumes specified in DD statements that
I        request JES3-setup devices. This subparameter does not apply
I        to permanently resident volumes.
I
I      {NONE }:Requests that JES3 not issue fetch messages.
I
I      {SETUP }: Requests that JES3 issue fetch messages to the
I        operator for the volumes specified in all DD statements
I        identified in the //*MAIN SETUP parameter. If you code
I        FETCH=SETUP without also coding the //*MAIN SETUP
I        parameter, JES3
I
I      {(ddname{,ddname}...) }: Requests that JES3 issue fetch
I        messages for only the volumes specified in DD statement ddname.
I
I      {/(ddname{,ddname}...)}: Requests that JES3 not issue fetch
I        messages for any volumes specified in DD statement ddname.
I
I    HOLD= {YES | NO}:
I      YES: Indicates that the job is to enter the system in
I        operator-hold status and be withheld from processing until
I        the operator requests its release. However, if an error
I        occurs during input service processing, the job is not held
I        for operator intervention.
I
I        This parameter has the same function as TYPRUN=HOLD on
I        the JOB statement.
I
I      NO: Indicates that the job is to enter the system normally.
I        Processing does not require operator intervention. If the
I        HOLD parameter is omitted, NO is the default.
I
I    IORATE= {LOW | MED | HIGH}: Indicates the I/O-to-processor ratio
I      for a job. Use this parameter to balance the mixture of jobs
I      selected for execution on the processor.
I
I    JOURNAL= {YES | NO}:Indicates whether or not JES3 is to create
I      a job journal for the job.
I
I      YES: Indicates that the job is to have a job journal.
I
I      NO: Indicates that the job is not to have a job journal.
I
I    LINES=: Indicates the maximum number of lines of data to be
I      printed from this job's sysout data sets and the action to
I      be taken if the maximum is exceeded.

I        1 through 6 decimal numbers from 1 through 9999.
I      WARNING or W: If the maximum is exceeded, requests that JES3
I        issue an operator warning message and continue processing.
I      mmm: Specifies the frequency that an operator warning message
I        is to be issued after the maximum specified by nnnnnn is
I        exceeded. mmm is a multiple of 10 in the range 10 to 100.
I        mmm is a percentage of nnnnnn that is used to calculate the
I        number of additional bytes between warning messages.
I      CANCEL or C: If the maximum is exceeded, requests that JES3
I        cancel the job.
I      DUMP or D: If the maximum is exceeded, requests that JES3 cancel
I        the job and ask for a storage dump.
I
I    LREGION=nnnnK
I      nnnnK: Specifies the approximate size of the largest step's
I        working set in real storage during execution. LREGION
I        (logical region) is used by JES3 to improve scheduling on
I        the processor. The nnnn is 1 through 4 decimal numbers that
I        indicate the size in kilobytes (1 kilobyte = 1024 bytes).
I
I    ORG= {group-name | {nodename{.remote}}: Indicates that the job's
I      sysout data sets are to be directed to the named group or

I       to the group of devices or node from which the job originated.
I
I      group-name: Specifies an origin group.
I
I      nodename: Specifies a network node. nodename is 1 through 8
I       characters.

I      this job's sysout data sets and the action to be taken if the
I      maximum is exceeded.
I
I      {({nnnnnnnn}{,WARNING}{,mmm})}
I      {({nnnnnnnn}{,W}{,mmm}) }
I      {({nnnnnnnn}{,CANCEL}) }
I      {({nnnnnnnn}{,C}) }
I      {({nnnnnnnn}{,DUMP}) }
I      {({nnnnnnnn}{,D}) }
I
I      nnnnnnnn: Specifies the number of pages. nnnnnnnn is 1 through
I        8 decimal numbers from 1 through 16777215.
I      WARNING or W: If the maximum is exceeded, requests that JES3
I        issue an operator warning message and continue processing.
I      mmm: Specifies the frequency that an operator warning message
I        is to be issued after the maximum specified by nnnnnn is
I        exceeded. mmm is a multiple of 10 in the range 10 to 100.

II
I    PROC= {ST | XX}: Names the procedure library that the system is
I      to search for cataloged procedures called by EXEC statements
I      in the job. If a procedure cannot be found in the named library,
I      JES3 abnormally terminates the job.
I
I      ST: Indicates the standard procedure library: SYS1.PROCLIB.
I
I      xx: Identifies the last 2 characters of the ddname of a procedure
I        library. xx is defined by the installation (IATPLBxx) in the
I        procedure used to start JES3. If this parameter is coded, only
I        the specified library is searched; SYS1.PROCLIB is not
I        searched.
I
I    RINGCHK= {YES | NO}: Indicates whether or not JES3 is to check the
I      status of the tape reel ring for tape devices set up by JES3.
I
I      YES: Indicates that a validation check is to be made. If the
I        RINGCHK parameter is omitted, YES is the default.
I
I      NO: Indicates that ring checking is to be by-passed for this job.
I
I    SETUP= : Modifies the standard setup algorithm used in assigning
I      devices to a job before its execution.
I
I      {JOB }: Requests job setup, which is allocation of all
I        JES3-managed devices required in the job before the job
I        executes. JES3 mounts the initial volumes necessary to run all
I        steps before the job executes. JOB overrides the SETUP
I        parameter on the JES3 STANDARDS initialization statement.
I
I      {HWS }: Requests high watermark setup, which is allocation of
I        the minimum number of devices required to run the job. The
I        minimum number is equal to the greatest number of devices of
I        each type needed for any one job step. High watermark setup
I        does not cause premounting of all mountable volumes.
I
I      {THWS }: Requests high watermark setup for tapes but job
I        setup for disks.
I
I      {DHWS }: Requests high watermark setup for disks but job
I        setup for tapes.
I
I      {(stepname.ddname{,stepname.ddname}...) }
I      {(stepname.procstepname.ddname{,stepname.procstepname.ddname}...) }
I      {/(stepname.ddname{,stepname.ddname}...) }
I      {/(stepname.procstepname.ddname{,stepname.procstepname.ddname}...)}
I        Specifies explicit setup, which is allocation of the volumes
I        needed for a DD statement before the job executes. JES3
I        premounts the indicated volumes. When requesting explicit
I        setup, specify enough devices so that JES3 can allocate all
I        the required devices at any one time. If too few devices are
I        specified, JES3 cancels the job.
I
I    SPART=partition-name: Indicates the spool partition in which
I      JES3 is to allocate spool space to this job.
I
I      partition-name: Specifies the name of the spool partition.
I        partition-name is 1 through 8 characters and must match a
I        partition name specified during JES3 initialization. If the
I        name does not match, JES3 ignores the SPART parameter and
I        uses the installation default.
I
I    SYSTEM=: Indicates the processor that is to execute this job. If
I      a specific processor is named, the processor name must also be
I      specified on the CLASS initialization statement for the job
I      class.
I
I      {ANY }: Indicates any global or local system that satisfies
I        the job's requirements.
I      {JGLOBAL }: Indicates that the job is to run on the global
I        processor only.
I      {JLOCAL }: Indicates that the job is to run on a local
I        processor only.
I      {(main-name{,main-name}...) }: Indicates that the job is to
I        run on the named processor or processors.
I      {/(main-name{,main-name}...)}: Indicates that the job is not
I        to run on the named processor or processors.
I
I    THWSSEP=: Indicates whether or not you want scratch tape requests
I        and specific tape requests separated and whether you want
I        scratch tapes of different media types separated during high
I        watermark processing. This parameter is valid only if high
I        watermark setup (HWS or THWS) is specified on the SETUP
I        parameter or defined at JES3 initialization.
I      {IGNORE }: Specifies that JES3 is not to separate scratch and
I        specific tape requests and not separate scratch tape requests
I        of different media types during high watermark processing.
I        Both scratch and specific tape requests and scratch requests
I        of different media types can be allocated on the same tape
I        drive.
I      {PREFER }: Specifies that JES3 attempt to allocate scratch and
I        specific tape requests on separate tape drives and attempt
I        to allocate scratch tape requests of different media types
I        on separate tape drives without allocating additional
I        devices. If JES3 cannot separate the requests, scratch and
I        specific tape requests and scratch tape requests of different
I        media types are allocated on the same tape drive.
I      {REQUIRE}: Specifies that JES3 should not allocate scratch and
I        specific tape requests on the same tape drive and not allocate
I        scratch tape requests of different media types on the same
I        tape drive, even if JES3 must allocate additional tape drives
I        to satisfy the request.
I
I    TRKGRPS=(primary-qty,second-qty): Specifies the number of track
I      groups to be assigned to the job. A track group is a number of
I      spool space allocation units. The size of the track group is
I      defined in the GRPSZ parameter on the JES3 BUFFER or SPART
I      initialization statement.
I
I      primary-qty: Specifies the number of track groups to be
I        initially allocated. This quantity is one decimal number
I        from 1 through 9.
I      second-qty: Specifies the number of track groups to be
I        allocated when the currently allocated groups are filled
I        and more space is needed. This quantity is one decimal
I        number from 1 through 9.
I
I    TYPE= {ANY | VS2}: Indicates the control program that is to
I      execute this job. If you omit a TYPE parameter, the job runs
I      under the control program used for the job's class.
I
I      ANY: Indicates that JES3 is to use any control program that
I        satisfies the job's requirements. In present systems, JES3
I        schedules the job on MVS.
I      VS2: Indicates that JES3 is to schedule the job on MVS.
I
I    UPDATE=(dsname{,dsname}...): Identifies the procedure library
I      data set(s) that this job is to update. This parameter causes
I      all jobs using the identified data set and any concatenated
I      data sets to be held until the update is complete.
I
I      dsname: Specifies the data set name. The identified data set
I        cannot be concatenated to another data set.
I
I    USER=userid: Identifies the job with the specified TSO/E user,
I      even though the job was not submitted via TSO/E by that user.
I
I      userid: Identifies a TSO/E user. userid is 1 through 7
I        alphanumeric or national ($, #, @) characters.
* End of wish.
