N  Assignments and symbols
N  -----------------------
NA variable is an object whose value can change during the running of a
NREXX program. The process of changing the value of a variable is
Ncalled assigning a new value to it. The value of a variable is a
Nsingle character string, of any length, that might contain any
Ncharacters.
N
NYou can assign a new value to a variable with the ARG, PARSE, or PULL
Ninstructions, the VALUE built-in function, or the Variable Access
NRoutine (IRXEXCOM), but the most common way of changing the value of
Na variable is the assignment instruction itself. Any clause of the
Nform:
N
N  symbol=expression;
N
Nis taken to be an assignment. The result of expression becomes the
Nnew value of the variable named by the symbol to the left of the
Nequal sign. On TSO/E, if you omit expression (SYMBOL=;), the variable
Nis set to the null string. However, it is suggested that you
Nexplicitly set a variable to the null string: symbol=''.
N
NThe symbol naming the variable cannot begin with a digit (0-9) or a
Nperiod. (Without this restriction on the first character of a
Nvariable name, you could redefine a number; for example 3=4; would
Ngive a variable called 3 the value 4.)
N
NYou can use a symbol in an expression even if you have not assigned
Nit a value, because a symbol has a defined value at all times. A
Nvariable you have not assigned a value is uninitialized. Its value is
Nthe characters of the symbol itself, translated to uppercase (that is,
Nlowercase a-z to uppercase A-Z). However, if it is a compound symbol
N(described under 'Compound symbols'), its value is the derived name
Nof the symbol.
