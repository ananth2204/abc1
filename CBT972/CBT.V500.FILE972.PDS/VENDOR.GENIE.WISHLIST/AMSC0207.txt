NSET Command
N-----------
NUse the SET command to change or reset a previously defined condition
Ncode. You can end all processing by setting MAXCC or LASTCC to 16.
NThe syntax of the SET command is:
N
D  SET MAXCC | LASTCC = number
N
N  where:
N
I  SET: States that a condition code value is to be set. A SET command
I    that follows a THEN or ELSE that is not run does not alter LASTCC
I    or MAXCC.
N
I  MAXCC: Requires that the value to be reset is the maximum condition
I    code set by a previous functional command. Setting MAXCC does not
I    affect LASTCC.
N
I  LASTCC: Specifies that the value to be reset is the condition code
I    set by the immediately preceding functional command.
N
I  number: Is the value to be assigned to MAXCC or LASTCC. The maximum
I    value is 16; a greater value is reduced to 16. If the value of
I    LASTCC is greater than MAXCC, MAXCC is set equal to the larger
I    value.
