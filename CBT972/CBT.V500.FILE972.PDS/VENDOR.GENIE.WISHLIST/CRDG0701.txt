NChapter 7. CONNECTION resources
N===============================
NCONNECTION attributes
N---------------------
NDescribes the syntax and attributes of the CONNECTION resource.
N
NSyntax:
N-------
D  DEFINE
D    CONNECTION(name)
I      specifies the name of this connection definition.
I      The name can be up to four characters in length.
N
D    GROUP(groupname)
I      Every resource definition must have a GROUP name.
I      The resource definition becomes a member of the group and is
I      installed in the CICS system when the group is installed.
N
I      The GROUP name can be up to eight characters in length. Lowercase
I      characters are treated as uppercase characters.
N
D    DESCRIPTION(text)
I      You can provide a description of the resource
I      that you are defining in this field. The description text can be
I      up to 58 characters in length. No restrictions apply to the
I      characters that you can use. However, if you use parentheses,
I      ensure that for each left parenthesis there is a matching right
I      parenthesis. If you use the CREATE command, for each single
I      apostrophe in the text, code two apostrophes.
N
D    AUTOCONNECT(NO | ALL | YES)
I      For systems using ACCESSMETHOD(VTAM),
I      you specify with AUTOCONNECT(YES) or (ALL) that sessions are to
I      be established (that is, BIND is to be performed). Such sessions
I      are set up during CICS initialization, or when you use the
I      CEMT or EXEC CICS SET VTAM OPEN command to start communication
I      with z/OS Communications Server. If the connection cannot be
I      made at these times because the remote system is unavailable,
I      you must subsequently acquire the link by using the CEMT or
I      EXEC CICS SET CONNECTION(sysid) INSERVICE ACQUIRED command,
I      unless the remote system becomes available in the meantime and
I      itself initiates communications.
N
N      For APPC connections with SINGLESESS(NO) specified, CICS tries
I      to bind, on system start-up, the LU services manager sessions in
I      mode group SNASVCMG.
N
N      For connection definitions with SINGLESESS(YES) specified, the
I      AUTOCONNECT operand is ignored. Use the AUTOCONNECT operand of
I      the session definition instead.
N
I      ALL: On this definition, ALL is equivalent to YES, but you can
I        specify ALL to be consistent with the session definition.
I        AUTOCONNECT(ALL) should not be specified for connections to
I        other CICS systems, because this can cause a bind-race.
N
I      NO: CICS does not attempt to bind sessions when the connection
I        is established.
N
I      YES: CICS attempts to bind only contention-winning sessions when
I        the connection is established.
N
D    DATASTREAM(USER | LMS | SCS | STRFIELD | 3270)
I      specifies the type of data stream.
N
I      LMS: The data stream is a Logical Message Services (LMS) data
I        stream consisting of FMH4s and FMH8s as defined in the
I        LUTYPE6.1 architecture.
N
I      SCS: The data stream is an SCS data stream as defined in the
I        LUTYPE6.1 architecture.
N
I      STRFIELD: The data stream is a structured field data stream as
I        defined in the LUTYPE6.1 architecture.
N
I      USER: Let DATASTREAM default to USER if the data stream is
I        user-defined. If you are communicating between multiple CICS
I        systems, always let DATASTREAM default to USER.
N
I      3270: The data stream is a 3270 data stream as defined in the
I        type 6.1 logical unit (LUTYPE6.1) architecture.
N
D    INSERVICE(YES | NO)
I      specifies the status of the connection that is
I      being defined.
N
I      NO: The connection can neither receive messages nor transmit
I        input.
N
I      YES: Transactions may be initiated and messages may automatically
I        be sent across the connection.
N
D    MAXQTIME(NO | seconds)
I      specifies a time control on the wait time
I      for queued allocate requests waiting for free sessions on a
I      connection that appears to be unresponsive. The maximum queue
I      time is used only if a queue limit is specified for QUEUELIMIT,
I      and then the time limit is applied only when the queue length has
I      reached the queue limit value.
N
I      NO: CICS maintains the queue of allocate requests that are
I        waiting for a free session. No time limit is set for the length
I        of time that requests can remain queued (though the DTIMOUT
I        mechanisms can apply to individual requests). In this case, a
I        value of X'FFFF' is passed on the XZIQUE parameter list (in
I        field UEPEMXQT).
N
I      seconds: The approximate upper limit on the time that allocate
I        requests can be queued for a connection that appears to be
I        unresponsive. The number represents seconds in the range 0
I        through 9999.
N
D    NETNAME(netname)
I      specifies the network name that identifies the
I      remote system. The name can be up to eight characters in length.
I      The name follows assembler language rules. It must start with an
I      alphabetic character.
N
I      The NETNAME is the APPLID of the remote system or region, unless
I      you are defining an LUTYPE6.1 or APPC link to a z/OS
I      Communications Server generic resource group.
N
D    QUEUELIMIT(NO | number)
I      specifies the maximum number of allocate
I      requests that CICS is to queue while waiting for free sessions:
N
I      NO: There is no limit set to the number of allocate requests
I        that CICS can queue while waiting for a free session. In this
I        case, a value of X'FFFF' is passed on the XZIQUE parameter
I        list (in field UEPQUELM).
N
I      number: The maximum number of allocate requests, in the range
I        0 through 9999, that CICS can queue on the connection while
I        waiting for a free session. When the number of queued allocate
I        requests reaches this limit, subsequent allocate requests
I        return SYSIDERR until the queue drops below the limit.
N
I        This queue limit is passed to an XZIQUE global user exit
I        program on the XZIQUE parameter list if the exit is enabled.
N
D    RECORDFORMAT(U | VB)
I      specifies the type of SNA chain.
N
I      U: Let RECORDFORMAT default to U if the SNA chain is a single,
I        unblocked stream of data. You can have private block algorithms
I        within the SNA chain. Let RECORDFORMAT default to U if you are
I        communicating between multiple CICS systems.
N
I      VB: The SNA chain is formatted according to the VLVB standard as
I        defined in the LUTYPE6.1 architecture.
N
D    XLNACTION(KEEP | FORCE)
I      XLNACTION specifies
I      the action to be taken when a new logname is received from the
I      partner system. Receipt of a new logname indicates that the
I      partner has deleted its recovery information.
N
I      Note: MRO here covers connections with ACCESSMETHOD set to either
I      IRC or XM.
N
I      FORCE: The predefined decisions for indoubt UOWs (as defined by
I        the indoubt attributes of the transaction definition) are
I        implemented, before any new work with the new logname is
I        started. CICS also deletes any information retained for
I        possible resolution of UOWs that were indoubt at the partner
I        system.
N
I        Attention: Data integrity may be compromised if you use this
I        option.
N
I      KEEP: Recovery information is kept, and no action is taken for
I        indoubt units of work.
N
I      For IRC, the connection continues with new work. Resolve indoubt
I      UOWs using the CEMT or SPI interface.
N
I      For APPC, the connection is unable to perform new work that
I      requires synclevel 2 protocols until all outstanding recoverable
I      work with the partner (that is, indoubt UOWs, or information
I      relevant to UOWs that were indoubt on the partner system under
I      the old logname) is completed using the CEMT or SPI interface.
N
NAttributes for APPC connections
N-------------------------------
D    ACCESSMETHOD(VTAM)
I      specifies the access method to be used for this connection.
N
I      VTAM: Communication between the local CICS region and the system
I        defined by this connection definition is through z/OS
I        Communications Server. You can use z/OS Communications Server
I        intersystem communication (ISC) for systems that are in
I        different MVS images or in different address spaces in the
I        same MVS image.
N
D    ATTACHSEC(LOCAL | IDENTIFY | MIXIDPE | PERSISTENT | VERIFY)
I      specifies the level of attach-time user security required
I      for the connection.
N
I      IDENTIFY: Incoming attach requests must specify a user
I        identifier. Enter IDENTIFY when the connecting system has a
I        security manager; for example, if it is another CICS system.
N
I      LOCAL: CICS does not require the client to supply to supply a
I        user identifier, or a password. All requests will run under the
I        userid specified in the SECURITYNAME attribute. If the PROTOCOL
I        attribute on the CONNECTION definition is LU6.1, you must
I        specify LOCAL.
N
I      MIXIDPE: Incoming attach requests may be using either or both
I        IDENTIFY or PERSISTENT security types. The security type used
I        depends on the incoming attach request.
N
I      PERSISTENT: Incoming attach requests must specify a user
I        identifier and a user password on the first attach request.
I        Subsequent attach requests require only the user identifier.
I        This should be used only between a programmable workstation,
I        (for example, an IBM Personal Computer) and CICS.
N
I      VERIFY: Incoming attach requests must specify a user identifier
I        and a user password. Enter VERIFY when the connecting system
I        has no security manager and hence cannot be trusted. Do not
I        specify VERIFY for CICS-to-CICS communication, because CICS
I        does not send passwords.
N
D    BINDSECURITY(NO | YES)
I      (APPC only): specifies whether an ESM is
I      being used for bind-time security.
N
I      NO: No external bind-time security is required.
N
I      YES: If security is active and the XAPPC system initialization
I        parameter is set to YES, CICS attempts to extract the session
I        key from RACF in order to perform bind-time security. If no
I        RACF profile is available, the bind fails.
N
D    PROTOCOL(APPC)
I      specifies the type of protocol
I      that is to be used for the link.
N
I      APPC (LUTYPE6.2 protocol): Advanced program-to-program
I      communication, or APPC protocol. This is the default value for
I      ACCESSMETHOD(VTAM). Specify this for CICS-CICS ISC.
N
I      blank: MRO between CICS regions. You must leave the PROTOCOL
I        blank for MRO, and on the SESSIONS definition you must specify
I        LU6.1 as the PROTOCOL.
N
I      EXCI: The external CICS interface. Specify this to indicate
I        that this connection is for use by a non-CICS client program
I        using the external CICS interface.
N
I      LU61: LUTYPE6.1 protocol. Specify this for CICS-CICS ISC or
I        CICS-IMS ISC, but not for MRO.
N
D    PSRECOVERY(SYSDEFAULT | NONE)
I      In a CICS region running with
I      persistent sessions support, this specifies whether, and how,
I      LU6.2 sessions are recovered on system restart within the
I      persistent session delay interval.
N
I      NONE: All sessions are unbound as out-of-service with no CNOS
I        recovery.
N
I      SYSDEFAULT: If a failed CICS system is restarted within the
I        persistent session delay interval, the following actions occur:
N
I        -> User modegroups are recovered to the SESSIONS RECOVOPTION
I           value.
N
I        -> The SNASVCMG modegroup is recovered.
N
I        -> The connection is returned in ACQUIRED state and the last
I           negotiated CNOS state is returned
N
D    REMOTENAME(connection)
I      specifies the name by which the APPC
I      connection for transaction routing is known in the system or
I      region that owns the connection. The name can be up to four
I      characters in length.
N
D    REMOTESYSNET(netname)
I      specifies the network name (APPLID) of the
I      system that owns the connection. The name can be up to eight
I      characters in length. It follows assembler language rules, and
I      must start with an alphabetic character.
N
D    REMOTESYSTEM(connection)
I      specifies the name that identifies the
I      intercommunication link to the system that owns the connection.
I      The name can be up to four characters in length.
N
D    SECURITYNAME(userid)
I      For APPC and LU6.1 links only, this is the
I      security name of the remote system. In a CICS system with
I      security initialized (SEC=YES), the security name is used to
I      establish the authority of the remote system.
N
I      Note: If USERID is specified in the SESSIONS definition
I      associated with the connection definition, it overrides the
I      userid specified in the SECURITYNAME attribute, and is used
I      for link security.
N
I      The security name (or USERID on the sessions definition) must
I      be a valid RACF userid on your system. Access to protected
I      resources on your system is based on the RACF user profile and
I      its group membership.
N
D    SINGLESESS(NO | YES)
I      specifies whether the definition is for an
I      APPC terminal on a single session APPC link to CICS.
N
I      NO: The definition is not for a single session APPC link to CICS.
N
I      YES: The definition is for an APPC terminal on a single session
I        APPC link to CICS.
N
N      The MODENAME attribute of the SESSIONS definition can be used
I      to supply a modename for the single session mode set.
N
N      An APPC single session terminal can also be defined as a TERMINAL
I      TYPETERM definition. Both the TERMINAL-TYPETERM definition and
I      the CONNECTION definition can be autoinstalled. If you are
I      considering using autoinstall, see Autoinstalling z/OS
I      Communications Server terminals.
N
D    USEDFLTUSER(NO | YES)
I      (APPC and MRO only): specifies the action
I      that is taken when an inbound FMH5 does not contain the security
I      information implied by the ATTACHSEC attribute.
N
I      NO: The attach request is rejected, and a protocol violation
I        message is issued.
N
I      YES: The attach is accepted, and the default user ID is
I        associated with the transaction.
N
I      For more information, see the CICS RACF Security Guide.
N
NAttributes for MRO connections
N------------------------------
D    ACCESSMETHOD(IRC | XM)
I      specifies the access method to be used for this connection.
N
I        Communication between the local CICS region and the region
I        defined by this connection definition is through the
I        interregion communication (IRC) program DFHIRP, using the SVC
I        (as opposed to cross-memory (XM)) mode of DFHIRP.
N
I        Note: This use of the term IRC is more specific than its
I        general use. You can use IRC for multiregion operation
I        (MRO) for regions that are in the same MVS image or in
I        different MVS images within a sysplex.
N
I        MRO communication between the local CICS region and the
I        region defined by its CONNECTION definition uses MVS
I        cross-memory services. Initial connection is through the
I        interregion communication (IRC) program DFHIRP, using the
I        cross-memory (XM) (as opposed to the SVC) mode of DFHIRP. You
I        can use XM for multiregion operation for regions that are in
I        the same MVS image, or in different MVS images within a
I        sysplex.
N
D    ATTACHSEC(LOCAL | IDENTIFY)
I      specifies the level of attach-time user security required
I      for the connection.
N
I      IDENTIFY: Incoming attach requests must specify a user
I        identifier. Enter IDENTIFY when the connecting system has a
I        security manager; for example, if it is another CICS system.
N
I      LOCAL: CICS does not require the client to supply to supply a
I        user identifier, or a password. All requests will run under the
I        userid specified in the SECURITYNAME attribute. If the PROTOCOL
I        attribute on the CONNECTION definition is LU6.1, you must
I        specify LOCAL.
N
I      MIXIDPE: Incoming attach requests may be using either or both
I        IDENTIFY or PERSISTENT security types. The security type used
I        depends on the incoming attach request.
N
I      PERSISTENT: Incoming attach requests must specify a user
I        identifier and a user password on the first attach request.
I        Subsequent attach requests require only the user identifier.
I        This should be used only between a programmable workstation,
I        (for example, an IBM Personal Computer) and CICS.
N
I      VERIFY: Incoming attach requests must specify a user identifier
I        and a user password. Enter VERIFY when the connecting system
I        has no security manager and hence cannot be trusted. Do not
I        specify VERIFY for CICS-to-CICS communication, because CICS
I        does not send passwords.
N
D    CONNTYPE(SPECIFIC | GENERIC)
I      For external CICS interface (EXCI)
I      connections, this specifies the nature of the connection.
N
I      GENERIC: The connection is for communication from a non-CICS
I        client program to the CICS system, and is generic. A generic
I        connection is an MRO link with a number of sessions to be
I        shared by multiple EXCI users. For a generic connection you
I        cannot specify the NETNAME attribute.
N
I      SPECIFIC: The connection is for communication from a non-CICS
I        client program to the CICS region, and is specific. A specific
I        connection is an MRO link with one or more sessions dedicated
I        to a single user in a client program. For a specific
I        connection, NETNAME is mandatory.
N
D    PROTOCOL(EXCI)
D    USEDFLTUSER(NO | YES)
N
NAttributes for LU type 6.1 connections
N--------------------------------------
D    ACCESSMETHOD(VTAM)
I      specifies the access method to be used for this connection.
N
I        Communication between the local CICS region and the system
I        defined by this connection definition is through z/OS
I        Communications Server. You can use z/OS Communications Server
I        intersystem communication (ISC) for systems that are in
I        different MVS images or in different address spaces in the
I        same MVS image.
N
D    PROTOCOL(LU61)
D    SECURITYNAME(userid)
N
NAttributes for indirect connections
N-----------------------------------
D    ACCESSMETHOD(INDIRECT)
I      specifies the access method to be used for this connection.
I        Communication between the local CICS system and the
I        system defined by this connection definition is through the
I        system named in the INDSYS operand.
N
D    INDSYS(connection)
I      specifies the name of another CONNECTION that
I      defines an intermediate system used to relay communications
I      between this system and the remote system. The name can be up to
I      four characters in length.
N
N
NObsolete attributes
N-------------------
N
I    BINDPASSWORD: This attribute is obsolete, but is supported to
I      provide compatibility with earlier releases of CICS. For more
I      information, see Obsolete attributes in Reference System
I      definition.
