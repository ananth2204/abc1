NThe utility program IEFBR14 performs no action other than
Nreturn a completion code of 0; however, 'running' this
Nutility invokes other system components that perform useful
Ntasks.
N
IThe following JCL for the job named SMITH1 accomplishes several
Itasks, even though IEFBR14 does nothing but return 0:
I
D//SMITH1 JOB 1,LEO,MSGCLASS=X
D// EXEC PGM=IEFBR14
D//NEWDS DD DSN=SMITH.LIB.CNTL,DISP=(NEW,CATLG),VOL=SER=WORK02,
D// UNIT=3390,SPACE=(CYL,(3,1,25)
D//OLDDS DD DSN=SMITH.OLD.DATA,DISP=(OLD,DELETE)
MThe z/OS job scheduler to check your JCL statements for syntax
Merrors.
I
MThe initiator allocates the new data set defined by NEWDS
M(SMITH.LIB.CNTL) and keeps the data set when the job ends.
I
MThe initiator also deletes an old data set defined by OLDDS
M(SMITH.OLD.DATA) at the end of the job.
* End of wish.
