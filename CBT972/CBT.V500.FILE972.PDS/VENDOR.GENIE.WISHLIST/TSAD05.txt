NChapter 5: ABEND dump
N---------------------
NAn ABEND dump shows the virtual storage predominately for an
NUnauthorized program. Typically, a dump is requested when the program
Ncannot continue processing and abnormally ends. An operator can also
Nrequest an ABEND dump while ending a program or an address space.
N
NThe system can produce three types of ABEND dumps, one unformatted dump
N(SYSMDUMP) and two formatted dumps (SYSABEND and SYSUDUMP). These dumps
Nare produced when a program cannot continue processing and a DD
Nstatement for an ABEND dump was included in the JCL for the job step
Nthat has ended. The data included is dependent on:
N
N-> Parameters supplied in the IEAABD00, IEADMR00, and IEADMP00
N   parmlib members for SYSABENDs, SYSMDUMPs, and SYSUDUMPs,
N   respectively.
N
N-> A determination by the system
N
N-> ABEND, CALLRTM, or SETRP macro dump options
N
N-> IEAVTABX, IEAVADFM, or IEAVADUS installation exit processing
N
NIBM recommends the use of SYSMDUMP, the unformatted dump. Unformatted
Ndumping is more efficient because only the storage requested is written
Nto the data set, which allows the application to capture diagnostic
Ndata and be brought back online faster. Also, pre-formatted dumps force
Nthe system to select a single set of reports, too many for the
Ndiagnosis of many problems, and too few for others. Unformatted dumps
Nallow the analyst to determine, from a wide variety of reports, what
Ninformation to use and how it is presented.
N
NUse SYSUDUMP for diagnosis of program problems that need simple problem
Ndata. A SYSABEND dump, through the IBM supplied defaults, supplies more
Nof the system information related to the application program's
Nprocessing than a SYSUDUMP. The additional information may be better
Nsuited for complex problem diagnosis.
