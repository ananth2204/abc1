NChapter 12. ENQMODEL resources
N==============================
NAn ENQMODEL defines a named resource for which the EXEC CICS ENQ and
NEXEC CICS DEQ commands have a sysplex-wide scope.
N
NCICS uses ENQMODEL resources with z/OS global resource serialization
Nto provide sysplex-wide protection of resources that are used by
Nmultiple applications. Local enqueues within a single CICS region are
Nmanaged in the CICS address space. Sysplex-wide enqueues that affect
Nmore than one CICS region are managed by z/OS global resource
Nserialization. For more information on global resource serialization,
Nsee SA23-1389-30 z/OS MVS Planning: Global Resource Serialization.
