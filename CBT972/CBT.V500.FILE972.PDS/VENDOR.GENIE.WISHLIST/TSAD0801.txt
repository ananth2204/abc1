NChapter 8: System trace
N=======================
NCustomizing system tracing
N--------------------------
NThe system starts system tracing during system initialization and the
Ntrace runs continually. There are, however, a few things you can do to
Nalter system tracing AFTER si COMPLETES. Restart system tracing with
Nbranch tracing using the TRACE command from a console with master
Nauthority.
N
NIncreasing the size of the system trace table.
N----------------------------------------------
NSystem trace tables reside in fixed storage on each processor. The
Ndefault trace table size is 1 MB per processor, but you can change it
Nusing the TRACE ST command.
N
ITRACE ST,BUFSIZ=20M
N
NRemember: Choose a reasonable value for the system trace storage after
Nconsidering the available central storage and the actual storage
Nrequired for system trace. Increasing the system trace storage to a
Nlarge value amount may cause shortage of pageable storage in the system.
N
N
NTracing branch instructions.
N----------------------------
NSystem tracing allows you the option of tracing branch instructions,
Nsuch as BALR, BASR, BASSM and BAKR, along with other system events. As
Nof z/OS V1R9, the option of mode tracing is separated from branch
Ntracing.
N
ITRACE ST,BR=ON
N
IAttention: Branch tracing ON can affect your system performance and use
Ivery large amounts of storage. Do not use branch tracing as the default
Ifor system tracing on your system. Only use it for short periods of time
Ito solve a specific problem. The default system tracing does not include
Ibranch instructions.

Ntrace entries and the mode trace entries that MVS combines with them
N(and are generated by the hardware).
