NSyntax for DELETE Parameters
N----------------------------
D  DELETE /* Abbreviation: DEL */ -
N
NRequired Parameters
N-------------------
D    (entryname ...) -
I      names the entries to be deleted. If more than one entry is to be
I      deleted, the list of entrynames must be enclosed in parentheses.
I      The maximum number of entrynames that can be specified is 100. If
I      the MASK keyword is specified, only one entryname can be
I      specified. This entryname is also known as the mask filter key.
I      The command will result in error if there are more than one mask
I      filter keys specified in one command.
N
I      Note that a mask entry name is honored only when a MASK keyword
I      is specified in the DELETE command.
N
I      This parameter must be the first parameter following DELETE.
N
I      entryname: is the name of the entry to be deleted. A generic name
I        can be coded to delete multiple entries with one entryname.
I        (For example, GENERIC.*.BAKER is a generic name where * is any
I        1-to-8 character simple name.)
N
NOptional Parameters
N-------------------
D    ALIAS | -
D    ALTERNATEINDEX | /* Abbreviation: AIX */ -
D    CLUSTER | /* Abbreviation: CL */ -
D    GENERATIONDATAGROUP | /* Abbreviation: GDG */ -
D    LIBRARYENTRY | /* Abbreviation: LIBENTRY | LIBENT */ -
D    NONVSAM | /* Abbreviation: NVSAM */ -
D    NVR | -
D    PAGESPACE | /* Abbreviation: PGSPC */ -
D    PATH | -
D    TRUENAME | /* Abbreviation: TNAME */ -
D    USERCATALOG | /* Abbreviation: UCAT */ -
D    VOLUMEENTRY | /* Abbreviation: VOLENTRY | VOLENT */ -
D    VVR -
I      specifies the type of object or entry to be deleted. If the
I      object to be deleted is a catalog, truename entry, or VSAM volume
I      record, USERCATALOG, TRUENAME, NVR, or VVR is required.
N
I      If you delete a migrated data set without specifying the entry
I      type, DFSMShsm will delete the data set without recalling it.
N
I      ALIAS: specifies that the entry to be deleted is an alias entry.
N
I      ALTERNATEINDEX /* Abbreviation: AIX */: specifies that the object
I        to be deleted is an alternate index and its data and index
I        entries. When a path entry is associated with the alternate
I        index, the path entry is also deleted.
N
I        When the alternate index has the to-be-upgraded attribute and
I        it is the only such alternate index associated with the base
I        cluster, the base cluster's upgrade-set entry is also deleted.
N
I        Exception: If RLS recovery is associated with the alternate
I        index, all knowledge of the recovery is lost as part of the
I        delete operation.
N
I      CLUSTER /* Abbreviation: CL */: specifies that the object to be
I        deleted is a cluster, its associated data and index entries,
I        and any related paths and alternate indexes.
N
I        When deleting a VVDS, entryname must be the restricted name
N
I        'SYS1.VVDS.Vvolser'.
N
I        Exception: If RLS recovery is associated with the sphere, all
I        knowledge of the recovery is lost as part of the delete
I        operation.
N
I      GENERATIONDATAGROUP /* Abbreviation: GDG */: specifies that the
I        entry to be deleted is a generation data group (GDG) entry. To
I        delete a generation data group that is not empty, you must
I        specify either the FORCE or the RECOVERY parameter. When FORCE
I        is used, all SMS managed generation data sets pointed to by the
I        GDG base are scratched. Generation data sets are also removed
I        from the catalog when you use FORCE.
N
I        For both SMS-managed and non-SMS-managed GDGs, if you use
I        RECOVERY, the GDG entry is deleted from the catalog and
I        generation data sets remain unaffected in the VTOC. To delete
I        a GDG using RECOVERY or FORCE, you must specify both
I        GENERATIONDATAGROUP and RECOVERY or GENERATIONDATAGROUP and
I        FORCE.
N
I        The FORCE and RECOVERY generation data set parameters require
I        RACF FACILITY class authorization. For information concerning
I        RACF authorization levels, search Appendix A, "Security
I        Authorization Levels".
N
I      LIBRARYENTRY /* Abbreviation: LIBENTRY | LIBENT */: specifies
I        that the entry to be deleted is a tape library entry. You must
I        specify the FORCE parameter to delete a tape library entry that
I        is not empty. A tape library entry is not empty when tape
I        volume entries are still associated with it.
N
I        To delete a tape library entry, you must have authorization to
I        RACF FACILITY class profile STGADMIN.IGG.LIBRARY.
N
I        Because access method services cannot change the library
I        manager inventory in an automated tape library, ISMF should be
I        used for normal tape library delete functions. The access
I        method services DELETE LIBRARYENTRY command should be used only
I        to recover from volume catalog errors.
N
I      NONVSAM: /* Abbreviation: NVSAM */: specifies that the entry to
I        be deleted is a cataloged non-VSAM data set entry or object
I        entry.
N
I        If the non-VSAM data set has aliases, all of its alias entries
I        are deleted when you use the DELETE command.
N
I        If the non-VSAM data set is partitioned, you can delete one of
I        its members by specifying pdsname(membername).
N
I        If the non-VSAM data set does not have an entry in a catalog,
I        you can delete its format-1 DSCB from the VTOC by using the
I        SCRATCH function of the IEHPROGM utility. See z/OS DFSMSdfp
I        Utilities.
N
M          Contact your System Programmer to do this.
N
I        Use this parameter to delete generation data sets (GDSs). You
I        can rerun the job step to reclaim a GDS that is in deferred
I        roll-in state, if GDS reclaim processing is enabled (it is
I        enabled by default). For more information about GDS reclaim
I        processing, see z/OS DFSMSdfp Storage Administration. SMS does
I        not support temporary non-VSAM data sets.
N
I        Exception: You can use RACF commands to specify an ERASE
I        attribute in a generic or discrete profile for a non-VSAM data
I        set. Use of the attribute renders all allocated DASD tracks
I        unreadable before space on the volume is made available for
I        reallocation. Refer to the appropriate RACF publications for
I        information about how to specify and use this facility.
N
I      NVR: specifies that the object to be deleted is an SMS-managed
I        non-VSAM volume record (NVR) entry. This parameter must be
I        specified to delete an NVR from a VSAM volume data set (VVDS)
I        and its corresponding record from the VTOC. The NVR/VTOC
I        entries are deleted only if the related non-VSAM object catalog
I        entry does not exist.
N
I        Similar to DELETE VVR, the FILE parameter must specify the DD
I        statement name that identifies the volume containing the VVDS.
I        If you select a catalog through alias orientation or by use of
I        the catalog parameter, it must match the catalog name in the
I        isolated NVR (unless you have read authority to the RACF
I        FACILITY class STGADMIN.IGG.DLVVRNVR.NOCAT).
N
I      PAGESPACE /* Abbreviation: PGSPC */: specifies that an inactive
I        page space is to be deleted. A page space is identified as
I        "active" during the operator's IPL procedure. To delete a page
I        space in an SMS-managed user catalog you must include the
I        CATALOG parameter.
N
I      PATH: specifies that a path entry is to be deleted. No entries
I        associated with the path are deleted.
N
I      TRUENAME /* Abbreviation: TNAME */: specifies that the object to
I        be deleted is the truename entry for a data or index component
I        of a cluster or alternate index, or the name of an alternate
I        index. This parameter must be specified to delete a truename
I        entry. The truename entry is deleted only if the associated
I        base record is missing or is inaccessible.
N
I      USERCATALOG /* Abbreviation: UCAT */: specifies that the object
I        to be deleted is a user catalog.
N
I        See the CATALOG(catname) parameter for deleting a specific
I        catalog. Specify USERCATALOG only when you want to delete the
I        entire CATALOG.
N
I        The catalog connector entry in the master catalog is deleted.
I        If the user catalog has aliases, all the catalog's alias
I        entries in the master catalog are deleted.
N
I        To delete a user catalog when it is empty (that is, it contains
I        only its self-describing entries and its volume's VVDS entry),
I        you must specify USERCATALOG. To delete a user catalog that is
I        not empty, you must specify both USERCATALOG and FORCE.
N
I        If you are deleting the catalog as part of recovering from a
I        backup copy, you may want to use the RECOVERY option instead.
I        For more information, see the RECOVERY keyword.
N
I        You can set up your system so that when you specify RECOVERY
I        with DELETE USERCATALOG, the system issues WTOR message
I        IDC1999I requesting confirmation before deleting user catalogs.
I        Use the modify command to enable or disable this WTOR feature
I        as follows: F CATALOG,ENABLE(DELRECOVWNG) or
I        F CATALOG,DISABLE(DELRECOVWNG). By default, the WTOR is
I        disabled. See the MODIFY command in z/OS MVS System Commands.
N
I      VOLUMEENTRY /* Abbreviation: VOLENTRY | VOLENT */: specifies that
I        the entry to be deleted is a tape library volume.
N
I        To delete a tape volume entry, you must have authorization to
I        RACF FACILITY class profile STGADMIN.IGG.LIBRARY. Because
I        access method services cannot change the library manager
I        inventory in an automated tape library, ISMF should be used
I        for normal tape library delete functions. The access method
I        services DELETE VOLUMEENTRY command should be used only to
I        recover from volume catalog errors.
N
I      VVR: specifies that the objects to be deleted are one or more
I        unrelated VSAM volume record (VVR) entries. To delete a VVR
I        from both the VSAM volume data set (VVDS) and from the VTOC,
I        you must specify this parameter.
N
I        The VVR entry is deleted only if the related cluster or
I        alternate-index data and index component catalog entries do
I        not exist. When VVR is specified, the component name of the
I        cluster or alternate-index to which the VVR was once related
I        must be specified in the entryname parameter. If you select a
I        catalog through alias orientation or by use of the catalog
I        parameter, it must match the catalog name in the isolated VVR
I        (unless you have read authority to the RACF FACILITY class
I        STGADMIN.IGG.DLVVRNVR.NOCAT).
N
I        The FILE parameter must specify the DD statement name that
I        identifies the volume on which the VVDS resides.
N
D    ERASE | NOERASE /* Abbreviations: ERAS and NERAS */ -
I      specifies whether the components of a cluster or alternate index
I      to be deleted are to be erased (overwritten with binary zeros).
I      This parameter overrides whatever was coded when the cluster or
I      alternate index was defined or last altered. Specify this
I      parameter only when a cluster or an alternate index entry is to
I      be deleted.
N
I      If you use ERASE, one of the following conditions must be true:
N
I      -> The entry is in the master catalog.
N
I      -> The qualifiers in the entry's qualified name are the catalog's
I         name or alias.
N
I      ERASE /* Abbreviation: ERAS */: specifies that the components are
I         to be overwritten with binary zeros when the cluster or
I         alternate index is deleted. If ERASE is specified, the volume
I         that contains the data component must be mounted.
N
I        If the cluster is protected by a RACF generic or discrete
I         profile and the cluster is cataloged in a catalog, use RACF
I         commands to specify an ERASE attribute as part of this profile
I         so that the data component is automatically erased upon
I         deletion.
N
I      NOERASE /* Abbreviation: NERAS */: specifies that the components
I         are not to be overwritten with binary zeros when the cluster
I         or alternate index is deleted.
N
I        NOERASE will not prevent the component from being erased if the
I         cluster is protected by a RACF generic or discrete profile
I         that specifies the ERASE attribute and the cluster is
I         cataloged in a catalog. You can use RACF commands to alter the
I         ERASE attribute in a profile.
N
D    FILE(ddname) -
I      specifies the name of the DD statement that identifies:
N
I      -> The volume that contains a data set to be deleted with
I         SCRATCH.
N
I      -> The data set to be deleted if ERASE is specified.
N
I      -> The partitioned data set from which a member (or members) is
I         to be deleted.
N
I      -> The volumes that contain VVDS entries for the objects
I         cataloged.
N
I      -> The VVDS volume that contains a VVR or NVR to be deleted.
N
I      Use of the FILE parameter improves the performance of the DELETE
I      command.
N
I      When you delete a data set, the volume referred to in the DD
I      statement must be the same as the volume referred to in the
I      usercatalog.
N
I      If you do not specify FILE and VSAM requires access to a volume
I      or volumes during the delete processing, VSAM tries to
I      dynamically allocate the volumes. When the entryname is
I      pdsname(membername) VSAM dynamically allocate the entire PDS
I      rather then the pdsname(member).
N
I      When more than one volume is to be identified (for example, a
I      multivolume data set), FILE identifies the DD statement that
I      specifies all volumes. If in any of the above cases the volumes
I      are of a different device type, use concatenated DD statements.
I      All volumes that contain associations to a cluster being deleted
I      must also be included on the DD statement referenced by the FILE
I      parameter.
N
I      When deleting multivolume non-VSAM data sets with the SCRATCH
I      option, DELETE SCRATCH processing requires access to each volume
I      in the entry's catalog record before the scratch can be issued.
I      This requires either all volumes to be mounted, online, and
I      allocatable to the job, or the use of the FILE parameter
I      specifying a DD statement allocating at least one mountable unit
I      (not permanently resident or reserved). Deferred mount must be
I      specified on the DD statement so that allocation will flag the
I      UCB to allow remove/mount requests to be issued for the unit as
I      required during delete processing. If access to the volumes
I      cannot be provided, use DELETE NOSCRATCH to uncatalog the
I      non-VSAM data set and the user will assume the responsibility of
I      scratching the format-1 DSCBs from all the volumes. If RACF is
I      installed, you must have access authority under RACF to specify
I      DELETE NOSCRATCH.
N
I      When the FILE parameter points to a DD statement that has
I      DISP=SHR the data set can be deleted when allocated to another
I      user, but is not open.
N
I      The use of this DD name in subsequent commands in the same
I      invocation of IDCAMS may not work properly. Specifically, DEFINE,
I      BLDINDEX, REPRO, and IMPORT may fail if these commands refer to
I      the same DD name for output from those commands. This is because
I      those commands will use volume and device-related information
I      that may no longer be applicable. BLDINDEX, REPRO, and IMPORT
I      should use the OUTDATASET keyword instead of OUTFILE to avoid
I      this problem.
N
M      Required when deleting a VVR entry.
N
D    FORCE | NOFORCE /* Abbreviations: FRC and NFRC */ -
I      specifies whether entries that are not empty should be deleted.
N
I      FORCE/* Abbreviation: FRC */: lets you delete generation data
I        groups, tape library entries, and user catalogs without first
I        ensuring that these entries are empty.
N
I        Attention: The FORCE parameter deletes all clusters in the
I        catalog.
N
I        If you delete a generation data group using FORCE:
N
I        -> Proper access authority to the RACF resource for catalog
I           functions is necessary for DELETE GDG FORCE. The
I           DELETE GDG FORCE function should not be used to redefine
I           the GDG limit value. ALTER LIMIT should be used instead.
N
I        -> The GDG entry is deleted even though it might point to
I           non-VSAM entries in the catalog.
N
I        -> Each SMS-managed non-VSAM data set entry pointed to by the
I           GDG base entry is deleted before the GDG base entry is
I           deleted. The non-VSAM data set is scratched.
N
I        -> Each non-SMS-managed non-VSAM data set entry pointed to by
I           the GDG base entry is deleted before the GDG base entry is
I           deleted.
N
I           However, the non-VSAM data set's space and contents on the
I           volume are undisturbed.
N
I        -> No VVDSs are deleted
N
I        If you delete a tape library entry using FORCE:
N
I        -> The tape library entry is deleted even if tape volume
I           entries are still associated with the specified tape
I           library.
N
I        -> Any tape volume entries associated with a deleted tape
I           library entry will remain in the catalog for these tape
I           volume entries.
N
I        If you delete a user catalog using FORCE:
N
I          Attention: The FORCE parameter deletes all clusters in the
I          catalog.
N
I        -> The user catalog is deleted even if it contains entries for
I           objects that have not been deleted.
N
I        -> All data sets cataloged in the user catalog as well as the
I           catalog data set itself are deleted. All volumes on which
I           these data sets reside must be included with the FILE
I           parameter.
N
I        -> All VSAM clusters are automatically deleted, but the
I           contents of each cluster and alternate index are not erased.
I           (If you specify FORCE, the ERASE parameter is ineffective.)
N
I        -> SMS-managed non-VSAM data set entries in the user catalog
I           are deleted and the data sets are scratched.
N
I        -> Non-SMS-managed non-VSAM data set entries in the user
I           catalog are deleted, but the data sets are not scratched.
I           A non-SMS-managed non-VSAM data set can be located with its
I           DSCB in the volume's VTOC.
N
I      NOFORCE /* Abbreviation: NFRC */: causes the DELETE command to
I        end when you request the deletion of a generation data group,
I        tape library entry, or user catalog that is not empty.
N
D    MASK | NOMASK -
I      when you specify the associated filter service rules to be used
I      for the entry-name (also called filter key). Use the MASK keyword
I      to specify a single entryname which is a filter key that
I      identifies the entries to be deleted.
N
I      MASK: The MASK keyword cannot be specified with the following
I        keywords:
N
I        -> TRUENAME (TRUENAME)
N
I        -> Non-VSAM Volume record (NVR)
N
I        -> VSAM Volume Record (VVR)
N
I        -> PDSE/PDS member data set
N
I        -> Library Entry (LIBRARYENTRY)
N
I        -> Tape Volume entry (VOLUMEENTRY)
N
I        The DELETE MASK command allows only one entry-name to be
I        specified. If there are multiple entry-names specified, the
I        request will fail with error messages.
N
I        Specifying MASK results in the entry name being passed to
I        Common Filter Services which is different from the generic
I        processing utilized by the default NOMASK. Adding MASK to an
I        existing entryname can produce different results in the data
I        sets deleted. See Catalog Search Interface User's Guide in
I        z/OS DFSMS Managing Catalogs for more information regarding
I        data set name filter keys.
N
I      NOMASK: Indicates the DELETE command contains generic filter
I        keys. This is the default.
N
D    PURGE | NOPURGE /* Abbreviations: PRG and NPRG */ -
I      specifies whether the entry is to be deleted regardless of the
I      retention period specified. If this parameter is used for objects
I      that do not have a date associated with them (for example, VVRs,
I      aliases, and non-SMS-managed non-VSAM data sets), the
I      PURGE|NOPURGE parameter is ignored and the object is deleted.
I      This parameter cannot be used if a truename entry is to be
I      deleted.
N
I      PURGE must be specified to delete an OAM non-VSAM entry, because
I      it has a never-expire retention.
N
I      PURGE /* Abbreviation: PRG */:  specifies that the entry is to
I        be deleted even if the retention period, specified in the TO
I        or FOR parameter, has not expired. When deleting a tape library
I        volume entry, PURGE must be specified if the volume's retention
I        period has not expired.
N
I        PURGE works the same way for migrated objects as it does for
I        non-migrated objects. PURGE overrides any DFSMShsm control over
I        the deletion of VSAM base clusters and non-VSAM data sets. It
I        causes the migrated data set to be deleted regardless of the
I        expiration date.
N
I      NOPURGE /* Abbreviation: NPRG */: specifies that the entry is not
I        to be deleted if the retention period has not expired.
N
D    RECOVERY | NORECOVERY /* Abbreviations: RCVRY and NRCVRY */ -
I      specifies whether a user catalog, a VSAM volume data set (VVDS),
I      or a generation data group (GDG) is to be deleted in preparation
I      for recovery.
N
I      RECOVERY /* Abbreviation: RCVRY */: When RECOVERY is specified
I        and the entry name identifies a user catalog, the user catalog
I        is to be replaced with an imported backup copy. The user
I        catalog, its VSAM volume record (VVR), and its VTOC entries
I        are deleted. The VVR and DSCBs, for each of the objects defined
I        in the user catalog, are not deleted or scratched. If the
I        catalog is RACF-protected, alter authority is required.
N
I        VSAM must be able to read the VVDS or be able to process it as
I        an ESDS for the function to complete successfully.
N
I        When RECOVERY is specified and entryname identifies a VVDS,
I        the VVDS is unusable or inaccessible and must be rebuilt by
I        deleting, redefining, and loading the appropriate VSAM data
I        sets on the volume. The VVDS entry's DSCB will be scratched
I        from the VTOC. The CATALOG parameter must contain the name of
I        the master catalog when a VVDS is deleted with the RECOVERY
I        parameter. If RACF protected, ALTER authority is required.
N
I        When RECOVERY is specified and the entry name identifies a GDG,
I        the SMS-managed or non-SMS-managed GDG entry is deleted from
I        the catalog and generation data sets remain unaffected in the
I        VTOC.
N
I        If a VVDS contains a catalog entry or a system data set (SYS1.)
I        entry that is cataloged in a master catalog, the VVDS catalog
I        entry and the DSCB of the associated VVDS will not be removed.
N
I        If you delete a generation data group (DELETE GDG RECOVERY)
I        using RECOVERY, proper authority to the RACF resource for
I        catalog function is necessary.
N
I        See the USERCATALOG parameter for information about using
I        RECOVERY with
M        IBM failed to finish that thought!
N
I      NORECOVERY /* Abbreviation: NRCVRY */: indicates that the entry
I        is to be processed as described by the other parameters
I        specified.
N
D    SCRATCH | NOSCRATCH /* Abbreviations: SCR and NSCR */ -
I      specifies whether a data set is to be removed from the VTOC of
I      the volume on which it resides. This parameter can be specified
I      only for a cluster, an alternate index, a page space, or a
I      non-VSAM data set.
N
I      Exception:
N
I      -> The SCRATCH parameter is not applicable to tape library and
I         tape volume entries because they have no VVDS or VTOC entries.
I         IDCAMS DELETE will determine if the data set to be deleted is
I         a tape data set and issue the NOSCRATCH option on the delete
I         request. For a data set on tape, using the NONVSAM parameter
I         with a fully qualified entryname might cause dynamic
I         allocation of the data set, and therefore a tape mount. To
I         avoid the tape mount in this situation, either specify
I         NOSCRATCH or omit NONVSAM.
N
I      -> If data set contains indirect or symbolic VOLSER, the scratch
I         parameter will be ignored, if specified.
N
I      SCRATCH /* Abbreviation: SCR */: specifies that a data set is to
I        be scratched from (removed from the VTOC of) the volume on
I        which it resides. For VSAM data sets and SMS-managed non-VSAM
I        data sets, the VSAM volume data set (VVDS) entry is also
I        removed.
N
I        DELETE SCRATCH will ignore any missing data set components
I        (such as VVRs or F1 DSCBs) and will scratch all the data set
I        parts that can be found at the time the request is issued.
N
I        When SCRATCH is specified for a VVDS, the VVDS is scratched and
I        the catalog entry for the VVDS is removed. The VVDS must be
I        empty.
N
I        If the catalog entry does not exist for a non-VSAM data set,
I        you can use the SCRATCH function of the OS/VS IEHPROGM utility
I        to remove the format-1 DSCB from the VTOC.
N
M          Contach your System Programmer to do this.
N
I        If you select SCRATCH, one of the following statements must be
I        true:
N
I        -> The entry is in the master catalog.
N
I        -> One or more of the qualifiers in the entry's qualified name
I           is the same as the catalog's name or alias.
N
I        -> The FILE parameter is specified.
N
I        If you specify SCRATCH when deleting a non-VSAM data set
I        defined with an esoteric device type, SYSDA for example, the
I        DELETE will be unsuccessful under the following circumstances:
N
I        -> Input/output configuration is changed resulting in addition
I           or deletion of one or more esoteric device types.
N
I        -> The esoteric device type definitions on the creating and
I           using systems do not match when the catalog is shared
I           between the two systems.
N
I        Note: If the VVDS indicates that the data set is owned by a
I        catalog other than that catalog identified through the usual
I        catalog search order for DELETE, a DELETE NOSCRATCH is done
I        against the catalog that resulted from the catalog search, and
I        a zero return code is returned to the user. For example, if
I        you specify a DELETE SCRATCH command against a data set in
I        Catalog A, and the VVDS indicates that the data set is owned
I        by Catalog B, a DELETE NOSCRATCH operation is done against
I        Catalog A, and the data set remains intact and accessible from
I        Catalog B. Search "Catalog Search Order for DELETE" for
I        information on the catalog search order for DELETE.
N
I      NOSCRATCH /* Abbreviation: NSCR */: specifies that the catalog
I        entry is to be deleted from the catalog without mounting the
I        volume that contains the object defined by the entry. VVDS and
I        VTOC entries are not deleted.
N
I        If RACF is installed, you must have access authority under
I        RACF to specify NOSCRATCH. With proper authority,
I        DELETE NOSCRATCH is allowed on SMS-managed VSAM and non-VSAM
I        data sets, thus deleting the BCS entry in the catalog without
I        accessing the VVDS or VTOC.
N
I        Attention:
N
I        -> DELETE NOSCRATCH can result in uncataloged SMS-managed data
I           sets.
N
I        -> DELETE NOSCRATCH cannot be issued against a VSAM data set
I           which is currently open.
N
I        For more information on cloning zFS, see the VOLUMES parameter
I        in Access Method Services DEFINE CLUSTER command in z/OS DFSMS
I        Access Method Services for Catalogs.
N
I        NOSCRATCH removes the catalog entry for a VVDS. This entry can
I        be reinstated with DEFINE RECATALOG. If the volume is mounted
I        and usable, the VVDS is checked to ensure that the catalog
I        entry being removed has no data sets in the VVDS. If the
I        catalog entry indicates there are data sets in the VVDS, the
I        VVDS's VSAM volume control record (VVCR) is removed and the
I        catalog entry for the VVDS is removed.
N
I        If the volume is mounted and you specify NOSCRATCH for a VSAM
I        volume data set (VVDS), the catalog entry for the VVDS is
I        removed, and the catalog back pointer in the VSAM volume
I        control record (VVCR) is removed.
N
I        You should specify NOSCRATCH for the following:
N
I        -> If the format-1 DSCB of a non-VSAM data set has already been
I           scratched from the VTOC.
N
I        -> If you are deleting a non-VSAM data set that was defined
I           with a device type named by the user (for example, SYSDA)
I           and the device type is not valid.
N
I        -> If the object is defined in a catalog and you want to
I           recatalog the object in the same catalog.
N
I        -> After you convert a volume, the names of catalogs owning
I           data sets on the volume will still be in the VVCR. Only
I           catalogs that reside on the converted volume need to have
I           their names in the VVCR. You can remove unneeded catalog
I           names from the VVCR by using DELETE VVDS NOSCRATCH with the
I           CATALOG parameter referencing the catalog to be deleted from
I           the VVCR. For coexistence, an error indication is still
I           returned if there are VVR or NVRs on the volume for the
I           referenced catalog.
N
I        -> NOSCRATCH affects the DFSMShsm delete function interaction
I           for VSAM base clusters and non-VSAM data sets. It causes
I           the migrated data set to be recalled because a migrated
I           data set cannot be uncataloged.
N
D    ) /* - */
N
M    CATALOG(mastercatname) /* Abbreviation: CAT */
I      Specifies the name of the catalog that contains the entries to
I      be deleted. Search "Catalog Search Order for DELETE" for the
I      order in which catalogs are searched.
N
I      This parameter cannot be used to delete a user catalog, and is
I      ignored when you delete members of a partitioned data set or the
I      tape library entry. To specify catalog names for SMS-managed data
I      sets, you must have authority from the RACF STGADMIN.IGG.DIRCAT
I      FACILITY class. Search "Storage Management Subsystem (SMS)
I      Considerations" for more information.
N
I      catname: identifies the catalog that contains the entry to be
I        deleted.
