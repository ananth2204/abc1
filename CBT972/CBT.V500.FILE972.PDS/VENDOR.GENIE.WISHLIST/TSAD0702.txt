NProblem data for storage overlays
N---------------------------------
N
NAnalyzing the damaged area
N--------------------------
NFirst, determine the extent of the bad data. Look for EBCDIC data or
Nmodule addresses in storage to identify the owner. Any type of pattern
Nin storage can indicate an error and identify the program that is using
Nthe damaged storage. Look at the data on both sides of the obviously bad
Nareas. See if the length of the bad area is familiar; that is, can you
Nrelate the length to a known control block length, data size, MVC
Nlength? If so, check various offsets to determine their contents and,
Nif you recognize some, try to determine the exact control block.
N
NRepetition of a pattern can indicate a bad process. If you can recognize
Nthe bad data you might be able to relate that data to the component or
Nmodule that is causing the error. This provides a starting point for
Nfurther analysis.
