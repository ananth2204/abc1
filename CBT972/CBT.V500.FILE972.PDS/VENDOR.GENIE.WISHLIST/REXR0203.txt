N--------------------------------
N  Structure and general syntax
N  ----------------------------
NComments
N--------
NA comment is a sequence of characters (on one or more lines) delimited
Nby /* and */. Within these delimiters any characters are allowed.
NComments can contain other comments, as long as each begins and ends
Nwith the necessary delimiters. They are called nested comments.
M
MRepeating the important part of comments, if you use /* within a
Mcomment then it must be terminated wirh */. This can crop up if you
Mattempt to put JCL in a comment and use //* for JCL comments.
N
D/* Begin of multi-line (block) comment
D
D   Use the following JCL to run this as a batch job:
D
D   //jobname JOB (acct),'programmer name',...
D   //*                                                    */
D   //* Purpose: Run REXX code as a batch job.             */
D   //*                                                    */
D   //ST01#01 EXEC PGM=IKJEFT1B,DYNAMNBR=12,
D   //             PARM=''
D   //SYSTSIN   DD *,DLM=$$
D     %myrexx
D     logoff
D     This is not executed.
D   $$
D   //SYSTSPRT  DD SYSOUT=*
D   //*                                                    */
D   //* End of Job.                                        */
D   //
