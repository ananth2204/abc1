N----------------------------
NUsing DAE to suppress dumps
N---------------------------
NStopping, starting, and changing DAE
N------------------------------------
NIf an ADYSET00 parmlib member is used and the DAE data set is allocated,
NDAE starts during IPL. Normally, DAE runs at the same time as the
Nsystem. However if DUMPSRV is ever cancelled or restarted, DAE restarts
Nas well albeit with dump suppression inactive You must manually
Nreactivate dump suppression using the SET DAE=xx command.
N
NAn operator can stop and start DAE with the following steps. One reason
Nto use these steps would be to change to a different ADYSETxx parmlib
Nmember with different parameters.
N
NStopping DAE
N------------
NYou can stop DAE with a SET DAE command that specifies the ADYSET01
Nparmlib member, which contains a DAE=STOP statement:
N
DSET DAE=01
N
N
NStarting DAE
N------------
NYou can start DAE with a SET DAE command that specifies an ADYSETxx
Nparmlib member that contains the DAE=START parameter, such as an
Ninstallation-provided ADYSET03 parmlib member:
N
DSET DAE=03
* End of wish.
