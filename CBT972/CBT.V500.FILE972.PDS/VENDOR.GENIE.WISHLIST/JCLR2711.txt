NJES2 Control Statement
N======================
NJECL /*JOBPARM Statement
N------------------------
NUse the /*JOBPARM statement to specify job-related parameters for JES2.
N
D/*JOBPARM {,parameter}...
I            {BURST | B} = {Y | N}
I              Specifies the default burst characteristic of all sysout
I              data sets that JES2 produces for this job. BURST applies
I              only when the data set is directed to a 3800 Printing
I              Subsystem equipped with a burster-trimmer-stacker.
I
I              Y: Requests that the 3800 output is to be burst into
I                separate sheets.
I              N: Requests that the 3800 output is to be in a
I                continuous fanfold.
I
I            {BYTES | M} = nnnnnn
I              nnnnnn: Specifies the maximum output, in thousands
I                of bytes, the system is to produce from this job.
I                The nnnnnn is 1 through 6 decimal numbers from 0
I                through 999999. When nnnnnn bytes are reached, JES2
I                gives control to an installation exit routine and
I                the job might or might not be terminated.
I
I            {CARDS | C} = nnnnnnnn
I              nnnnnnnn: Specifies the maximum number of output
I                cards to be punched for this job's sysout data sets.
I                The value is 1 through 8 decimal numbers from 0
I                through 99999999. When the specified number of cards
I                is reached, JES2 gives control to an installation
I                exit routine and the job might or might not be
I                terminated.
I
I            {COPIES | N} = nnn
I              nnn: Specifies how many copies of the spool lines or
I                bytes for this job's sysout data sets are to be
I                printed or punched. The nnn is 1 through 3 decimal
I                numbers from 1 through 255. An installation can
I                reduce the upper limit of this value during JES2
I                initialization.
I
I            {FORMS | F} = {xxxxxxxx | STD}
I              Specifies the print and/or punch forms JES2 is to
I                use for sysout data sets for which FORMS is not
I                specified on the DD statement or on a
I                JES2 /*OUTPUT statement.
I
I              xxxxxxxx: Identifies the print or punch forms. The
I                xxxxxxxx is 1 through 8 alphanumeric or
I                national ($, #, @) characters.
I
I              STD: Indicates that JES2 is to use the default
I                specified at JES2 initialization.
I
I            {LINECT | K} = nnn
I              nnn: Specifies the maximum number of lines that JES2
I                is to print on each output page for this job's
I                sysout data sets. The nnn is 1 through 3 numbers
I                from 0 through 254.
I
I            {LINES | L} = nnnnnn
I              nnnnnn: Specifies the maximum output, in thousands of
I                lines, that JES2 is to place in the spool data sets
I                for this job's sysout data sets. The number is 1
I                through 6 decimal numbers from 0 through 999999.
I                When the specified number of lines is reached,
I                JES2 gives control to an installation exit routine
I                and the job might or might not be terminated.
I
I                The LINES parameter applies only to line-mode data.
I                See also the PAGES parameter.) If the sysout data
I                set contains both line-mode and page-mode data,
I                the lines and pages are counted separately and
I                checked separately against the limit.
I
I            {NOLOG | J}
I              NOLOG: Requests that JES2 not print the job's
I                hard-copy log. The job's hard-copy log contains the
I                JES2 and operator messages about the job's processing.
I
I            {PAGES | G} = nnnnnnnn
I              nnnnnnnn: Specifies the maximum number of output pages
I                to be printed for this job's sysout data sets. The
I                number is 1 through 8 decimal numbers from 0 through
I                99999999. When the specified number of pages is
I                reached, JES2 gives control to an installation exit
I                routine and the job might or might not be terminated.
I
I            {PROCLIB | P} = ddname
I              ddname: Requests a JES2 procedure library by its ddname,
I                as defined in the JES2 procedure used to initialize
I                JES2. Typically, JES2 procedure library ddnames are
I                in the format PROCnn, where nn is either 00 or 1
I                or 2 decimal numbers from 1 through 99. You can,
I                however, use any valid ddname as long as the name
I                matches the ddname in the JES2 procedure. The system
I                retrieves called cataloged procedures from the
I                requested JES2 procedure library.
I
I            {RESTART | E} = {Y | N}
I              Requests one of the following, if this job is executing
I                before a re-IPL and JES2 warm start, and the job
I                cannot restart from a step or checkpoint.
I
I              Y: Requests that JES2 queue the job for re-execution
I                from the beginning of the job.
I
I              N: Requests that JES2 take no special action.
I
I            {ROOM | R} = xxxx
I              xxxx: Indicates the programmer's room number. The xxxx
I                is 1 through 4 alphanumeric characters. JES2 places
I                the room number on the job's separators so that the
I                installation can deliver the job's sysout data sets
I                to the programmer.
I
I            {SYSAFF | S} = {cccc | * | *{,IND}) | ANY | (ANY,IND)}
I              cccc: Indicates the systems that are eligible to process
I                the job. The parameter indicates from 1 system
I                affinity representing a JES2 member name, up to the
I                number of entries that can be coded on a JOBPARM
I                statement, limited by the number of JES2 members that
I                can exist in a MAS.
I
I            {TIME | T} = nnnn
I              nnnn: Estimates the job execution time, in minutes of
I                real time. The nnnn is 1 through 4 decimal numbers
I                from 0 through 9999. If you omit a TIME parameter and
I                a time subparameter in the JOB statement accounting
I                information parameter, JES2 uses an installation
I                default specified at initialization. If job execution
I                exceeds the time, JES2 sends a message to the operator.
* End of wish.
