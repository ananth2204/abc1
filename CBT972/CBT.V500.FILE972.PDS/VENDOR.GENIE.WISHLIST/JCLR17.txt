NIF/THEN/ELSE/ENDIF Statement Construct
N======================================
NThis topic describes the IF/THEN, ELSE, and ENDIF statements,
Ncollectively called the IF/THEN/ELSE/ENDIF statement construct.
N
NUse the IF/THEN/ELSE/ENDIF statement construct to conditionally
Nexecute job steps within a job.
N
D//Ýname¨ IF Ý(¨relational-expressionÝ)¨ THEN Ýcomments¨
I..
Iaction when relational-expression is true
I.
D//Ýname¨ ELSE Ýcomments¨
I..
Iaction when relational-expression is false
I.
D//Ýname¨ ENDIF Ýcomments¨
N
NThe IF statement consists of the characters // in columns 1
Nand 2 and the five fields:
N->name,
N->operation (IF),
N->the relational-expression,
N->the characters THEN, and
N->comments.
IThe relational-expression can be enclosed in parentheses.
N
NThe ELSE statement consists of the characters // in columns 1 and 2 and the thr
name, operation (ELSE), and comments.
N
NThe ENDIF statement consists of the characters // in columns 1 and 2 and the th
name, operation (ENDIF), and comments.
N
NThe IF statement is always followed by a relational-expression and
Na THEN clause. Optionally, an ELSE clause can follow the THEN
Nclause. An ENDIF statement always follows the ELSE clause, if
Npresent, or the THEN clause.
N
N->The THEN clause specifies the job steps that the system processes
N  when the evaluation of the relational-expression for the IF
N  statement is a true condition.
N
N->The system evaluates the relational-expression at execution time.
N
N->The ELSE clause specifies the job steps that the system processes
N  when the evaluation of the relational-expression for the IF
N  statement is a false condition.
N
N->The ENDIF statement indicates the end of the IF/THEN/ELSE/ENDIF
N  statement construct, and must be coded for each construct.
N
NYou can nest IF/THEN/ELSE/ENDIF statement constructs up to a maximum
Nof 15 levels. The steps that execute in a THEN clause and an ELSE
Nclause can be another IF/THEN/ELSE/ENDIF statement construct.

MKenneth E. Tomiak remark:
MNesting the IF/THEN/ELSE/ENDIF statement construct is a sign of
Mpoor design. It will be a burden to code the proper conditions when
Mthe job fails and a RESTART is desired from other than the top.
M
MCOND= versus IF..THEN/ELSE/ENDIF comparison
M-------------------------------------------
MThe COND= parameter at the JOB and STEP level is coded to specify
Mwhen NOT to execute a step. Programmers think in terms of when TO
Mdo something. I found thinking inversely to control the
Mnon-execution of a step to be cumbersome. I was not alone.
M
MWhile the conditions on the IF..THEN construct may be coded for
Mnegative comparison, the result is now when TO execute the step.
MRelegating the NOT logic where it belongs under the ELSE construct.
