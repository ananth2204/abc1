N====================
NDEST Parameter
N--------------
NUse the DEST parameter to specify a destination for the sysout data
Nset. The DEST parameter can send a sysout data set to a remote or
Nlocal terminal, a node, a node and remote work station, a local
Ndevice or group of devices, or a node and userid.
N
D//outds OUTPUT DEST=cccccccc
I                 LOCAL|ANYLOCAL: Indicates any local device.
I
I                 'IP:ipaddr' | 'nodename.IP:ipaddr': Identifies a
I                   TCP/IP routing designation, where ipaddr can be
I                   any printable character string of from 1 to 124
I                   characters. The entire parameter list is limited
I                   to 127 characters, and it must be enclosed in
I                   single quotation marks.
I
I                 name: Identifies a destination by a symbolic name
I                   (for example, a local device, remote device, or a
I                   userid) which is defined by the installation during
I                   JES2 initialization. The name can be, for example,
I                   a local device, remote device, or a userid. The name
I                   is 1 through 8 alphanumeric or national ($, #, @)
I                   characters.
I
I                 Nnnnnn: Identifies a node. nnnnn is 1 through 5
I                   decimal numbers from 1 through 32,767.
I                   For example, N103.
I
I                 NnRmmmmm:
I                 NnnRmmmm:
I                 NnnnRmmm:
I                 NnnnnRmm:
I                 NnnnnnRm:
I                   Identifies a node and a remote work station
I                   connected to the node. The node number, indicated in
I                   the format by n, is 1 through 5 decimal numbers from
I                   1 through 32,767. The remote work station number,
I                   indicated in the format by m, is 1 through 5 decimal
I                   numbers from 1 through 32,767. Do not code leading
I                   zeros in n or m. The maximum number of digits for
I                   n and m combined cannot exceed six.
I
I                   Note: R0 is equivalent to LOCAL specified at
I                         node Nn.
I
I                 nodename.userid: Identifies a destination node and a
I                   VM or a TSO/E userid, a remote workstation, or a
I                   symbolic name defined at the destination node. The
I                   nodename is a symbolic name defined at the node of
I                   execution. nodename is 1 through 8 alphanumeric or
I                   national ($, #, @) characters. userid is 1 through
I                   8 alphanumeric or national ($, #, @) characters,
I                   and must be defined at the specified node.
I
I                 Rnnnnn:
I                 RMnnnnn:
I                 RMTnnnnn:
I                   Identifies a remote workstation. nnnnn is 1 through
I                   5 decimal numbers from 1 through 32,767. Note that
I                   with remote pooling, the installation may translate
I                   this route code to another route code.
I
I                   If you send a job to execute at a remote node and
I                   the job has a ROUTE PRINT RMTnnnn statement, JES
I                   returns the output to RMTnnnn at the node of origin.
I                   For JES2 to print the output at RMTnnnn at the
I                   executing node, code DEST=NnnnRmmm on an OUTPUT
I                   JCL statement or sysout DD statement.
I
I                   Note: R0 is equivalent to LOCAL.
I
I                 Unnnnn : Identifies a local terminal with special
I                   routing. nnnnn is 1 through 5 decimal numbers
I                   from 1 through 32,767.
I
I                   If you send a job to execute and the job has a
I                   ROUTE PRINT Unnnn statement, JES returns the
I                   output to Unnnn at the node of origin.
I
I                 userid: Identifies a userid at the local node.
I                   Userid for TSO/E is 1 through 7 alphanumeric or
I                   national ($, #, @) characters. The userid can
I                   also be a destination name defined in a JES2
I                   DESTID initialization statement.
N
NExample 1: Send SYSOUT to a REMOTE device.
N------------------------------------------
NIn this example, JES2 sends the sysout data set to remote terminal 444.
N
D//REMOT1 OUTPUT DEST=R444
N
NExample 2: Send SYSOUT to a named destination.
N----------------------------------------------
NIn this example, JES sends the sysout data set to a named destination.
NThis might be a remote station or network connected printer serviced
Nby LRS-VPS, IBM InfoPrint Server, or any other vendor product.
N
D//REMOT2 OUTPUT DEST=STAT444
N
NExample 3: Send SYSOUT to another system's destination.
N-------------------------------------------------------
NIn this example, JES sends the sysout data set to node KOKVMBB8 that
Ndelivers it VM userid DP58HHHD.
N
D//VMUSR OUTPUT DEST=KOKVMBB8.DP58HHHD
N
NExample 4: Send SYSOUT to another system's destination.
N-------------------------------------------------------
NIn this example JES2 sends the sysout data set to node NEWYORK, where
Na functional subsystem that can process IP-distributed data sets
nsends the data to the bldprt-2 host system/device.
N
D//REMOT4 OUTPUT DEST='NEWYORK.IP:bldprt-2'
N
NExample 5: Use TCP/IP to route output.
N--------------------------------------
NIn this example the functional subsystem sends the sysout data to the
Nhost machine at IP address 9.117.84.53.
N
D//REMOT5 OUTPUT DEST='IP:9.117.84.53'

MYou are advised to use HOST names and not static IP addresses.
