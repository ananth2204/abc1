NChapter 17: AMATERSE
N--------------------
NAdditional considerations for AMATERSE
N--------------------------------------
NWhen using AMATERSE, certain restrictions apply as well as allocation
Nand space considerations, as well as restrictions to consider when you
Nare using AMATERSE.
N
NRestrictions for AMATERSE
N-------------------------
NThe following restrictions apply to AMATERSE:
N
N-> VSAM data sets and direct (DSORG=DA) data sets are not supported.
N
N-> Data sets with keys (KEYLEN) are not supported.
N
N-> A partitioned data set (PDS) compressed by AMATERSE on MVS cannot be
N   unpacked by VM TERSE. This results in a 1007 or 1009 return code from
N   VM TERSE. A PDS must be compressed to a DASD.
N
N-> Partitioned data sets extended (PDSE) containing program objects are
N   not supported.
N
N-> AMATERSE can only handle data sets with a LRECL of more than 32K but
N   less than 64K when only RECFM=VBS DASD data sets are processed.
N
N-> A data set with the FB record format can be packed and unpacked to a
N   FBS data set. However, during the UNPACK operation, extending a
N   non-empty output data set with DISP=MOD is not possible because this
N   results in a FB data set. An error message is issued for this.
N
N-> AMATERSE does not support large block interface (LBI).
N
N
NAllocation considerations
N-------------------------
NThe data set compressed by AMATERSE (produced by PACK or SPACK) must be
Nof fixed or fixed-blocked record format (RECFM) with a record length
N(LRECL) of 1024 and any legal block size (BLKSIZE). These values do not
Nhave to be specified explicitly on the DD statement.
N
NThe data set restored by AMATERSE (produced by UNPACK) must match the
Noriginal RECFM and LRECL. Leave the DCB information off the DD statement
Nfor AMATERSE program to set it up. If it unpacks to an already existing
Ndata set then the DCB parameters are checked for compatibility. RECFM
Nmust be the same in all cases except for Variable to Undefined and
NUndefined to Variable. If you specify the DCB parameters to force data
Nthat was originally variable (V) format into undefined (U) format, or
Nconversely, a warning message is written and the operation is performed.
N
NSpace considerations
N--------------------
NWhen allocating space for the output data set SYSUT2, you must estimate
Nthe required size information:
N
N-> For the PACK or SPACK option a data set compressed by AMATERSE is
N   expected to be about half the size of the original. Allocate more
N   than expected and use the RLSE (partial release parameter) function
N   of the SPACE value to release the unused portion back to the system.
N
N-> For the UNPACK option: If the data set contains random data, allocate
N   three to five times the size of the compressed data set. If the data
N   set contains Listing, Document, or Messages type data, allocate five
N   to ten times the size of the compressed data set.
N
NIf there is not enough allocated space, the program issues ABEND X'B37':
I
INot Enough Space Allocated for the Output Data Set
