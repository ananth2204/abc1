NChapter 10: The Generalized Trace Facility (GTF)
N------------------------------------------------
NStopping GTF
N------------
NYou can enter the STOP command at any time during GTF processing. The
Namount of time you let GTF runs depends on your installation and the
Nproblem you are trying to capture, but a common time is between 15 and
N30 minutes.
N
NTo stop GTF processing, enter the STOP command. The STOP command must
Ninclude either the GTF identifier specified in the START command, or the
Ndevice number of the GTF trace data set if you specified MODE=EXT or
NMODE=DEFER to direct output to a data set. If you have not specified the
NGTF identifier in the START command, then those instances of GTF will
Nhave the same identifier: the volume serial number.
N
DSTOP id or device-id
