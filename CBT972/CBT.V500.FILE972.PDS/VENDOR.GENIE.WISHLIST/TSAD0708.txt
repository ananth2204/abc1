NProblem data for machine checks
N-------------------------------
NThe hardware uses a machine check interruption to tell the control
Nprogram that it has detected a hardware malfunction. Machine checks vary
Nconsiderably in their impact on software processing:
N
N-> Soft errors: Some machine checks notify software that the processor
N   detected and corrected a hardware problem that required no software
N   recovery action.
N
N-> Hard errors: Other hardware problems detected by a processor require
N   software-initiated action for damage repair. Hard errors also require
N   software recovery to verify the integrity of the process that
N   experienced the failure.
N
NThe machine check interrupt code (MCIC) in the PSA FLCMCIC field
Ndescribes the error causing the interrupt. An MCIC can have more than
None bit on to indicate more than one failing condition.
N
NFor a machine check, the system writes a logrec error record. The error
Nrecord contains the MCIC, except when:
N
N-> The LRBMTCKS bit in field LRBMTERM of the logrec buffer (LRB) is ON
N   to indicate that the machine check old PSW and the MCIC are both
N   zero.
N
N-> The LRBMTINV bit in field LRBMTERM is ON to indicate that the machine
N   check old PSW is nonzero but the MCIC is zero.
N
NHard errors cause FRR and ESTAE processing.
N
NReference:
NSee z/Architecture Principles of Operation for a complete description of
Nthe MCIC.
