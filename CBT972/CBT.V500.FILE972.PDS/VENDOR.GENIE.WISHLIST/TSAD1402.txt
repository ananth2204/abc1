NChapter 14: Recording logrec error records
N------------------------------------------
NChoosing the correct logrec recording medium
N--------------------------------------------
NYou can choose where the system will record logrec error records. When a
Nsystem is not in a sysplex, an installation can use a logrec data set,
Nassociated with an individual system, to record error records. An
Ninstallation can choose to continue this type of recording by
Ninitializing the logrec data set before IPLing the system that will use
Nit.
N
NIn a sysplex, however, because each system requires its own logrec data
Nset, you might need to look at each logrec data set when an error
Noccurs. To eliminate the problem of having to manage up to 32 logrec
Ndata sets, an installation can choose to define one coupling facility
Nlogrec log stream. Using a coupling facility logrec log stream
Neliminates the following:
N
N-> Running IFCDIP00 to initialize multiple logrec data sets
N
N-> Handling full or emergency data set conditions
N
N-> Scheduling the daily offload of logrec data sets
N
N-> Concatenating multiple history data sets
N
N-> Archiving logrec records
* End of wish.
