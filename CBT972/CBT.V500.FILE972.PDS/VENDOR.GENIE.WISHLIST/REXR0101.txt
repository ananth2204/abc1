NChapter 1. Introduction
N-----------------------
N  What the SAA Solution Is
N  ------------------------
NThe SAA solution is based on a set of software interfaces, conventions,
Nand protocols that provide a framework for designing and developing
Napplications.
N
NThe purpose of SAA REXX is to define a common subset of the language
Nthat can be used on several environments. TSO/E REXX is the
Nimplementation of SAA REXX on the z/OS system. If you plan on running
Nyour REXX programs on other environments, however, some restrictions
Ncan apply and you should review the publication SAA Common Programming
NInterface REXX Level 2 Reference.
N
NSupported environments
N----------------------
NSeveral combinations of IBM hardware and software have been selected
Nas SAA environments.
N
NThe SAA environments are the following:
N-> z/OS
N   -> Base system (TSO/E, APPC/MVS, batch)
N   -> CICS TS
N   -> IMS
N-> z/VM
N-> i5/OS
N-> Operating System/2 (OS/2)
N
N
NCommon programming interface
N----------------------------
NThe Common Programming Interface (CPI) provides languages and services
Nthat programmers can use to develop applications that take advantage
Nof SAA consistency.
N
NThe CPI is not in itself a product or a piece of code. But as a
Ndefinition it does establish and control how IBM products are being
Nimplemented, and it establishes a common base across the applicable
NSAA environments.
