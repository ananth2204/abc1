NChapter 16: SPZAP
N-----------------
NUpdating the System Status Index (SSI)
N--------------------------------------
NYou can use the SETSSI control statement to overlay the existing data in
Nthe SSI with your own data.
N
NThe SSI is a 4-byte field created by the linkage editor in the directory
Nentry of a load module. It is useful for keeping track of any
Nmodifications that are performed on a load module. SPZAP updates the
Nsystem status index automatically whenever it replaces data in the
Nassociated module.
N
NNot all load modules have system status information. In those that do,
Nthe SSI is located in the last four bytes of the user data field in the
Ndirectory entry.
M
MThere is rarely a good reason for you to mess with the SSI.
