* =====================================================================
*
* GUIDE:  This file maps coding construct names in PDS members for the
*         Configuration file of Applications, Chapters, and Topics.
*
* =====================================================================
*
* There are three types of records in the configuration file $$$$$$$$.
* They form PDS member names.
*
*        A = Application:
*            It must be 4 characters.
*        C = Chapter:
*            It must be 6 characters.
*        T = Topic:
*            It must be 8 characters.
*        * = Comments that are ignored, explains only 3 record types.
*
* Order is important.
*   "A"pplications come first.
*   "C"hapters     come second.
*   "T"opics       come third.
*
* Multiple records should be in the order you want them
* concatenated together. The ISPF panel shows the first 60 bytes.
* I updated GENIE to display several lines if you use
* a question mark (?) as the line command. even then, you want the
* first 60 characters to clearly describe the entry.
*
* =====================================================================
*
* The WISH members correspond to Application, Chapter, and Topic.
*
* %WISHLIST will use the following record types:
*
*   S = Source member name (Needs to match the member name).
*   T = Title.
*
* %WISHLIST will put a Ztimestamp record in the member it creates.
*
* =====================================================================
* End of wish.
