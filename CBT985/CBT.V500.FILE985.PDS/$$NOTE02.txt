Dear Sam,

I hope that you are in good health.

I would like to ask you the following favor:

I would like to replace the present FILE985
(File # 985 REXX execs from Marius Lewin)
with the replacement file that I am sending.

I added a number of rexx including:

u an edit macro executing a z/OS Unix command with standard input
      the presently edited member and standard output the same
      member (as info lines or as a replacement after saving the
      edited member).

vu  view or edit a library member in UTF-8.

cp shows terminal code page at top right of screen.

guessutf8 a called rexx which tries to provide a guess on whether
      the received st

lazy displays on the same screen in terminal codepage, in
      IBM-1047 (Unix) and in a provided string or "The quick
      brown fox jumps over the lazy dog".

lastcmd and retp two rexx with different code providing the last
      command or prev

rexxmac  An example of an edit macro in rexx's clothing.

t   A rexx timer. It displays every minute a small box with the
    number of minute (default: one hour).

scr  refresh panel cache.

humpty  extracts data records from a non compressed, non
           encrypted ADRDSSU DUMP with RECFM=FB

flat   rexx to sequentalize a library.


The original source PDS in IBM-1147 EBCDIC French codepage was
converted to the US IBM-1140 EBCDIC codepage then XMITed and
downloaded in binary by FTP.  The XMIted file contains a $$README
summary member and an acknowledgment member named ACK.

I am sending the XMITed file.

I thank you for making my rexx execs available on cbttape.org.

All the best of everything to you and your family.
