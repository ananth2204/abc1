//*  DESCRIPTION -                                         *
//*                                                        *
//*      zCBT address space is a system task (STC)         *
//*      to prepare zCBT subsystem initialization.         *
//*      zCBT subsystem is an event management system      *
//*      (EMS) which lets users to automate their          *
//*      system using rexx program.  zCBT supports         *
//*      some rexx functions to interact with 4 types      *
//*      of events: MSG, CMD, EOJ and EOS.                 *
//*                                                        *
//*                                                        *
//*  OPERATION -                                           *
//*                                                        *
//*      This STC can either to bring up zCBT subsystem    *
//*      or be brought up by zCBT subsystem.  When it      *
//*      brings up zCBT subsystem, it prepares data area   *
//*      and LPA modules prior to setup the subsystem.     *
//*                                                        *
//*      When it is brought up by zCBT subsystem (for      *
//*      example: when subsystem is brought up during      *
//*      NIP in respond to IEFSSNxx parameter or by        *
//*      issueing SETSSI command), it checks dataarea      *
//*      and LPA modules.  If data area does not exist     *
//*      then allocate it.  If LPA modules not ready in    *
//*      LPA, then load them.  Upon completion, send       *
//*      acknowledgement signal to zCBT initialization     *
//*      task.                                             *
//*                                                        *
//*      Once checking or preparation successfully done,   *
//*      this task then terminated.  You don't need to     *
//*      start it again until next IPL.                    *
//*                                                        *
//*      If all CBTEMSxx modules are already in LPA,       *
//*      for example if you make them preloaded with       *
//*      either LPALSTxx or IEALPAxx or IEAFIXxx           *
//*      PARMLIB definition, then you don't need to        *
//*      run this address space.                           *
//*                                                        *
