Written a long time ago in a land far away.  This is a single player
version of yahtzee.  Written when I was learning rexx so it isn't
as 'good' of code as I'd probably write now but... hey it works
and who has time to rewrite a working set of code.
I have tried to make it as near to the standard yahtzee rules
as possible.  Edit member YZ to your received dataset names
and place YZ in a sysproc/sysexec concatenated dataset.
please email me with any info or problems you
may encounter.
   Thanks and ENJOY
