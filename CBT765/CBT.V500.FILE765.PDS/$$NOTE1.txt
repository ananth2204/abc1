Hi,

Want to contribute the attached file.

It's something I wrote to do forms-based authentication with the
HTTP server for z/OS (the one that comes free with z/OS).

It's not very polished. And it's kinda slow.  It's really just a
proof-of-concept thing that never went much further.  But I hope
it is useful to somebody.
