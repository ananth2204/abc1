Forms-based Authentication for the IBM HTTP Server for z/OS
-----------------------------------------------------------

This REXX program and some supporting PL/I programs implement
forms-based authentication for the IBM HTTP Server for z/OS.

We're a poor, State-run, academic institution so we can't afford
to buy expensive software like the Websphere Application Server
where such things as forms-based authentication are built-in (I
don't know if it is or not, but was told that was the case).

We have the HTTP server that comes as part of the base z/OS
system. But, being that we are an academic institution, our
network tends to be open to to just about anybody and our
customers need to be able to access our systems from around the
world. For us, it's important that we have a secure (i.e.
encrypted) login process.

Also, many of our customers utilize two-factor authentication
tokens such as RSA's SecurID tokens or PassGo Technology's
DigiPass tokens. We needed an authentication mechanism that took
that into account.

This program runs as a GWAPI/REXX pre-exit.

To use this program, edit your HTTP server's configuration file.
On my system, it is /etc/httpd.conf (I think that's the default).
Assuming that you copied the REXX program to directory /myGWAPI,
define the program as a pre-exit:

  PreExit /usr/lpp/internet/bin/IMWX00.so:IMWX00/myGWAPI/RACFauthR.rx

I don't know if it's necessary or not, but we defined protection
directives for the applications that will be authenticating -- we
were originally using BASIC authentication and never took out the
directives.  In case this thing needs it, I figured I'd better
let you know what we had:

  Protection ITS_User {
          ServerId        ITS_User
          AuthType        Basic
          PasswdFile      %%SAF%%
          Mask            All
  }
Protect /MVSDS*         ITS_User %%CLIENT%%
Protect /RACFmaint*     ITS_User %%CLIENT%%

Service /MVSDS*     /usr/lpp/internet/bin/mvsds.so:mvsdsGet*
Service /RACFmaint* /usr/lpp/internet/bin/IMWX00.so:IMWX00/myGWAPI/RACFmaint.rx

The PL/I programs are compiled and linked into a load library
that is in the HTTP server's STEPLIB. We're using the IBM
Enterprise PL/I for z/OS v3r4 compiler. We also had to do

  RDEFINE PROGRAM ** ADDMEM('MY.IMWLOAD'//NOPADCHK) UACC(READ)
for the load library.

I didn't include our stylesheets and images because I don't think
anybody would be interested in using them. The stylesheets I use
were set up as an inside joke -- our web applications still look
like "green screen" 3270 stuff (see the screenshot.jpg).

I hope this is useful to somebody.
