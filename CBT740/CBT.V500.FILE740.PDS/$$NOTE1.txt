Sam

Thanks for your effort.  Attached please find a text file
describing the usage of the rexx.  This text is also part of the
application.  (It is member RSQLDOC in this file.)

A Short decription of this rexx:

RSQL is a Rexx application to Execute SQL statements.  I have
tested it extensively on "Select", "Insert" and "Update"
Statements.  Output can be requested in Columnar, CSV, Flat or
HTML format.

Feedback on the product will be appreciated, but I cannot promise
to provide any support.  I will when I can.

Regards
Alan Wynne
