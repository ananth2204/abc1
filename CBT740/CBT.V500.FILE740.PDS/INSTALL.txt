Installing RSQL on your system.
===============================

Installing RSQL on your system should be very simple. there are two
steps to follow.

Step 1: Place members in the a SYSPROC Library.
-------

  Copy the following members into a dataset in your SYSPROC
  concatenation.

      RSQL
      RSQLDFLT
      RSQLDOC
      RSQLEXEC
      RSQLTRIM

Step 2: Setup Defaults.
-------

  Edit the RSQLDFLT member to set up your instalaion defaults. The
  member has comments that should help, Some of the defaults are
  already provided, and I suggest you leave them as they are. The rest
  that are question marks you will need to determine for your site.
  The ValidSSID's parameters must list valid SSID in your site.


Step 3: Verify that the Programs Work.
-------

  I have provided a number of jobs to test and demostrate this utility
  and some of it's parameters.

  IVPJOB0 will show you how to run a simple query and some of the
  results types that you can get. it provides a simple list of tables
  in your database.

  IVPJOB1 could help build a data-dictionary for import into a
  Spread sheet program or other type of Visual Database application.
  the query instead of just one result set produces four four. It can be
  used to help build a Data Dictionary of the Database. The job assumes
  that xmitip is laready installed anmd emails the result sets to an
  email address you must provide.

  IVPJOB2 and IVPJOB3 are the same as 1 but provide the result sets in
  different formats.

  Before running these job please first do the following:

    1 : Add a valid jobcard to the jobs.
    2 : Change all "YOUR.SITE.SYSPROC" to the dataset where you
        installed RSQL.
    3 : Change all "RSQL.INSTALL.LIBARY" to the library name of this
        uploaded file. (Check that you have a member called DATADICT
    4 : Change all "YOUR.SITE.XMITIP.LOAD" to the load library where
        the xmitip data has been installed into.
    5 : Change all "YOUR.SITE.XMITIP.EXEC" to the REXX library where
        the xmitip Rexx'es have been installed into.
    6 : Update the member DATADICT and change all occurances of ????
        in it to an appropriate data base creator.
