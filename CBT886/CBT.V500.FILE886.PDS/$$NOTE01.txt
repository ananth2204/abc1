Hello Bill,

BETTER LATE THAN NEVER!   I apologize for not getting these REXX
jobs to you sooner; I've been swamped with so much other work.  I
rewrote many of my REXX execs late last year so that they all
follow a similar format.  Attached are 2 JOBLIBS including each
REXX.

* Init new installed subsystem.txt :  Job used to initialize a
newly installed subsystem.

Contains 1st , the JCL used to execute the REXX. It contains
fairly detailed description for manipulating the REXX.

The second half is the actual REXX.  You will want to update the
JOBCARD and possibly the VTOC and INDEX sizes to your liking.

* Init existing volumes.txt : Job used to initialize existing
volumes.

Contains 1st , the JCL used to execute the REXX. It contains
fairly detailed description for manipulating the REXX.

*   It utilizes PGM UCBSCAN to build your input library.

The second half is the actual REXX.  You will want to update the
JOBCARD and possibly the VTOC and INDEX sizes to your liking.

*   PGM=MBWAIT is a utility we use to wait for X seconds before
    completing step and continuing to the next step.  I place
    this program after my VARY commands.  Replace this with your
    personal wait pgm.

I'll see you at SHARE!!!

Regards,
Ed
