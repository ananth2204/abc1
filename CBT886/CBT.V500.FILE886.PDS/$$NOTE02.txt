Hello, Ed!

Thank you very much for the REXX EXECs.   My team now uses PC SAS
9.3 on Windows to generate ICKDSF jobs to initialize tens of
thousands of volumes.  The team needed to initialize 30,000+
volumes for some performance testing on our z/196 with HDS VPS
storage last summer.  Hence necessity being the mother of
invention.

Nonetheless, I like the fact that with your code there is no
dependency on an OEM product to drive the build process, and it
will run  anywhere  with little to no modification.  I'll have to
check into Mod-54s and EAVs, which I assume you do not have/use
based upon the hard-coded literals?  I'm going to copy Sam Golob,
the keeper of the CBT tape to see if he has interest in the
EXECs.  I assume he does not have them.

I noticed your reference to 'MBWAIT'.   We use a similar program,
which was written at a former employer in the late 1970s.  See
the comments for details on using it.  You are free to
redistribute it as you see fit as it's on the CBT tape, too.

I look forward to seeing you in my home town of San Francisco
next month.  I believe this will be a very good SHARE given that
it s in The City, will have strong IBM executive presence, and
John Eells will disclose z/OS 2.1 content on Monday afternoon.

Kind regards and thanks again,

Bill Smith

BTW  Were you affected by Hurricane Sandy?
