         - updates required. instructions in member.
         - jobs are created in the outfile.
##INTVOL - jcl used to build init jobs for existing subsystem.
         - updates required. instructions in member.
         - update the location of UCBSCAN.
INTNEWRX - rexx used for ##INTNEW jcl.
         - one time update:
            jobcard information on line 33+
            VTOC sizes on lines 50 - 59. supports upto Mod27 DASD.
INTVOLRX - rexx used for ##INTVOL jcl.
         - one time update:
           * jobcard information on line 18+
           * update MBWAIT parm with your time to wait on lnes 79 & 204
           * VTOC sizes on lines 112 - 121. supports upto Mod27 DASD.
           * VTOC sizes on lines 136 - 145. supports upto Mod27 DASD.

MBWAIT   - This is a standalone utility meant to be executed in a
           batch job as a way of delaying the execution of subsequent
           steps.
         - pgm specified in rexx (INTVOLRX) so wait for VARY commands
           to complete.
UCBSCAN - identifies all online device ucbs and chpids.
         - it will identify DASD types through MOD27's.
         - it will need to be updated for MOD54 and EAV devices.
         - pgm specified in JCL (##INTVOL)
