//***FILE 934 is from a member of the IBM DFSORT staff, and is      *   FILE 934
//*           a DFSORT job which creates Phil Polchinski's          *   FILE 934
//*           maximum size CALENDAR FILE, without needing Phil's    *   FILE 934
//*           CALFILE program to do it.  This is being included     *   FILE 934
//*           here for the reason that if you don't have access     *   FILE 934
//*           to Phil's CALFILE program, then you can still         *   FILE 934
//*           create his calendar file to use, using DFSORT.        *   FILE 934
//*                                                                 *   FILE 934
