//***FILE 951 is from Nick Light and contains his tool written      *   FILE 951

//*           the characteristics of an existing GDG.               *   FILE 951

//*     I created a REXX exec, with a couple of panels and          *   FILE 951
//*     messages, to convert a GDG to a GDG extended (GDGE).        *   FILE 951
//*     Converting to a GDGE enables the GDG limit to increase      *   FILE 951
//*     from a maximum 255 generations to 999 generations.  It      *   FILE 951
//*     started out as a simple program to do that conversion       *   FILE 951
//*     in batch, but at Lionel Dyck's prompting, it grew over      *   FILE 951
//*     several iterations into something that can be used,         *   FILE 951
//*     online or in batch, to create a new GDG base or modify      *   FILE 951
//*     an existing GDG base.                                       *   FILE 951
