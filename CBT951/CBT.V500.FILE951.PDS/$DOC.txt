STEMEDIT, on CBT file 895, is required to be installed if you wish
to use the GDGP panel for online processing.

-----------------------------------------------------------------------
|  INSTALLATION INSTRUCTIONS:                                         |
-----------------------------------------------------------------------

- Copy GDGP to your SYSEXEC library.
- Copy GDGPH and GDGPP to your ISPF panel library.
- Copy GDGP00 to your ISPF message library.
- Install STEMEDIT from CBT file 895.
- Update the following statement in the GDGP exec to specify the
  SYSEXEC library where you copied GDGP:

     "//SYSEXEC   DD DISP=SHR,DSN=dsn.where.GDGP.exists"

|  HOW IT WORKS:                                                      |
-----------------------------------------------------------------------

This REXX EXEC allows the user to do a couple of things:

1.  Create a new GDG if the one specified by the user does not exist;
    or,

2.  If the GDG does exist, modify the base with the properties
    specified by the user.

To modify an existing GDG, the EXEC processes as follows:

1.  If the new limit specified is 255 or less, or the GDG is already
    defined as NONEXTENDED, then the ALTER command is used to update
    the GDG.

2.  If the GDG is defined as NONEXTENDED and a limit of greater than
    255 is requested, the following process is executed:

    a.  Uncatalog each GDS, disassociating it with the base.
    b.  Delete the GDG base and redefine it with the requested
        specifications.
    c.  Re-catalog each GDS, re-associating it with the base.

NOTE:  This process will work with generations on either DASD or tape.
       However, if the ALTER command cannot be used for the updates
       (item 2 above is required for processing), this exec will not
       work with one or more generations that have been archived.

This REXX EXEC can be run any of 4 ways:

1.  Online displaying a panel.  The panel is displayed when TSO GDGP
    is invoked without both the GDG base and limit specified.  If
    either are specified, they will be displayed initially on the
    panel.

2.  Online without a panel.  If TSO GDGP is invoked with at least the
    GDG base and limit specified, the panel will not be displayed and
    and processing will occur with exactly the parameters specified
    when GDGP was invoked.

3.  In batch from the panel.  On the GDGP panel, specify B (for Batch),
    and JCL will be displayed which can be submitted to execute the
    process as a batch job.

4.  As a batch job.  Simply submit the job from your JCL library.
    Following is sample JCL:

    //GDGP     EXEC PGM=IKJEFT01
    //SYSEXEC   DD DISP=SHR,DSN=rexx.dsn
    //SYSTSPRT  DD SYSOUT=*
    //SYSTSIN   DD *
    GDGP gdg.base.name limit nscr emp fifo purge

|  PARAMETERS:                                                        |
-----------------------------------------------------------------------

Parameters passed to this program are as follows:

The following two parameters are required and positional:

Base    1st parameter.  An existing GDG base to be converted or the
        name of a GDG base to be created.
Limit   2nd parameter.  The GDG limit for the converted/new GDG base.

        On the panel only, if left blank and the specified GDG base
        already exists, the current attributes are displayed on the
        panel.

The following parameters are all optional and can be entered in any
order (after the first two required parameters).  See DFSMS Access
Method Services Commands for detailed descriptions of each parameter.

SCRATCH/NOSCRATCH  NOSCRATCH is the default.
EMPTY/NOEMPTY      NOEMPTY is the default.
FIFO/LIFO          LIFO is the default.
PURGE/NOPURGE      NOPURGE is the default.  When NOSCRATCH is
                   specified, NOPURGE is automatically set.

For new GDGs, the above defaults are taken when nothing is specified.
For existing GDGs, the value is not changed if not specified/
overridden by the user.
