Hi Sam,

I created a REXX exec, with a couple panels and messages, to
convert a GDG to a GDG extended (GDGE).  Converting to a GDGE
enables the GDG limit to increase from a maximum 255 generations
to 999 generations.  It started out as a simple program to do
that conversion in batch, but at Lionel Dyck's prompting, it grew
over several iterations into something that can be used, online
or in batch, to create a new GDG base or modify an existing GDG
base.

If you think this is something that can be used, feel free to add
it to the CBT tape.  I don't mind you including my contact info.

Attached is a file in TSO XMIT format.

PS  Thanks for all your help in the past!
