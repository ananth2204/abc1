//*       The following programs are now available that will        *   FILE 839
//*       allow the above to happen, using conventional JCL or      *   FILE 839
//*       TSO.                                                      *   FILE 839

//*       2. PARMCNTL creates either Fixed or Variable blocked      *   FILE 839
//*          control file from a Parameter, or other control        *   FILE 839
//*          file.                                                  *   FILE 839

//*       1. EXECLONG executes the program specified with the       *   FILE 839
//*          PARM='PGM=program-name'.  It first reads a VB file     *   FILE 839
//*          allocated with a DDNAME of $$PARM, and creates a       *   FILE 839
//*          standard parameter of up to 3,000 bytes.               *   FILE 839
//*                                                                 *   FILE 839
//*          Standard APF facilities are used, so Authorised or     *   FILE 839
//*          Non-Authorised programs may be used.                   *   FILE 839

//*       2. PARMCNTL creates either FB or VB control files from    *   FILE 839
//*          either the VB $$PARM file.                             *   FILE 839
//*                                                                 *   FILE 839
//*          PARMCNTL creates a file using the $$CNTL file.  It     *   FILE 839
//*          either takes it's input from the parameter field,      *   FILE 839
//*          or, if that is null, it reads from the $$PARM file.    *   FILE 839
//*                                                                 *   FILE 839
//*          New control cards are created on finding a LF (X'25')  *   FILE 839
//*          character, or <p>.                                     *   FILE 839
//*                                                                 *   FILE 839
//*          After forming up the parameter fields or the records   *   FILE 839
//*          from the $$PARM DD File, the following parameters      *   FILE 839
//*          are allowed:                                           *   FILE 839
//*                                                                 *   FILE 839
//*             PGM=program-name  - Program to be executed.         *   FILE 839
//*             DDN=ddname        - Instead of the $$CNTL,          *   FILE 839
//*                                 use ddsname instead.            *   FILE 839
//*             PARM='parameter'  - Use this parameter.             *   FILE 839
//*                                 Quotes are not allowed.         *   FILE 839
//*                                                                 *   FILE 839
//*       3. SAVEPARM appends it's parameter to the VB $$PARM       *   FILE 839
//*          file.  Symbolic parameters may be used in the PGM      *   FILE 839
//*          PARM field, and hence can be used by the PARMCNTL      *   FILE 839
//*          program to create control files with symbolic          *   FILE 839
//*          parameters replaced.                                   *   FILE 839
