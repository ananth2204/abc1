NOTE:  Member $PROCS has some cataloged procedures that do the
       following.

1.     CATDEF   PROC  CAT=,NAME=,VOL=,DEVT=3380

       Executes IDCAMS to create a catalog.

       When Executed like this:

       // EXEC CATDEF,CAT=SYS1.UCAT.MVS,NAME=GCC.ASM,VOL=JOL60,
       //      DEVT=3380

       the following control cards are created for IDCAMS.
       We can see that the symbolic parameters copied into
       the control file for IDCAMS, and IDCAM is run.

        DEFINE CAT (SYS1.UCAT.MVS) NONVSAM -
        ( NAME (GCC.ASM) -
          VOL (JOL60) DEVT (3380))

2.     FTP    PROC  INDSN=,OUTDSN=,PASSWORD=,HOST=,USER=

       //  EXEC FTP,HOST=192.10.10.1,USER='userid',PASSWORD='mypassword',
       // INDSN=NULLFILE,OUTDSN=FROM.MAINFRAME

       the following control cards are created for FTP.
       We can see that the symbolic parameters copied into
       the control file for FTP, and FTP is run.

       There is a DDCARD 'IN' created, which FTP uses.  It can be

       When Executed like this:

       //  EXEC COPYPDSS,INDSN='SYS1.PROCLIB',OUTDSN=&&TEMP,
       //       SELECT='RDR,INIT,NONO'

       the members RDR,INIT,NONO are copied to the &&TEMP
       data set.

4.     PDSRENM  PROC  INDSN=,MEM=,NEWNAME=

       Executes IDCAMS to rename a member is the specified
       INDSN PDS.  Only one member can be specified.

       When Executed like this:

       // EXEC PDSRENM,INDSN=CLARKE.TEST2.PDS,MEM=RDR,
       // NEWNAME=RDR4

       the member RDR is renamed to RDR4.

5.     PDSDELM  PROC  INDSN=,MEM=

       Executes IDCAMS to delete a selected member from the

       // EXEC PDSDELM,INDSN=CLARKE.TEST2.PDS,MEM=RDR

       the member RDR is deleted from the CLARKE.TEST2.PDS

6.     SORT   PROC  INDSN=,OUTDSN=,OUTDISP=NEW,FIELDS=,CYLS=5

       Executes SORT to sort a file.

       When Executed like this:

       //  EXEC SORT,INDSN=&&TEMPSRT,OUTDSN=&&TEMP,
