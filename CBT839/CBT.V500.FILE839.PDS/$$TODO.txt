There are a few items that need some comment:

1. The program do not convert parameters etc to Upper Case.
   Perhaps they should?

2. Sometime in the future, I will add the Jol Automatic Symbolics
   such as SYSUID, SYSDATE, DAY, etc (See the Jol documentation).

Enjoy the programs.

Please get back to me if you would like changes.

Cheers,
