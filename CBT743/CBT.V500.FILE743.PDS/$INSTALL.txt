Installation Instructions:

1) After RECEIVING THE XMIT file into a Dataset (You have already done
   that or you would not be looking at this member), go to SPF option
   6 command line and enter this command:

      EXEC  'XXXXXXXX.MODLISTR(INSTALL)'

   Where XXXXXXXX is the HLQ of this dataset.  The INSTALL Rexx exec
   will tailor and copy the MODLISTR members to your runtime libraries
   after prompting you for these 4 pieces of information:

       1) Output Dataset name containing the PDS members
          created by the RECEIVE INDS command (and is also
          the dataset which contains this Rexx Exec).
       2) The HLQ (High-Level Qualifier) to be used to install
          the MODLISTR runtime libraries.
       3) The Volser to be used to allocate the runtime
          libraries and Logfile.
       4) The Dataset name of the exec library concatenated
          to ddname SYSPROC to copy the MODLIST exec into
          for foreground invocation of exec MODLIST.

   After prompting for these 3 pieces of information
   it will tailor the install file members and the
   user will then be ready to continue the install of
   this product.

2) After the INSTALL exec completes, the following members should
   reside in the following libraries:

        XXXXXXXX.MODLISTR.CNTL (Where XXXXXXXX is HLQ above):

            INSTALL1
            INSTALL2
            INSTALL3

        XXXXXXXX.MODLISTR.EXEC (Where XXXXXXXX is HLQ above):

            ML
            MODLIST
            BIGLGET
            BIGLET
            CALLMODL
            TSOTRAP

        XXXXXXXX.MODLISTR.SOURCE and XXXXXXXX.MODLISTR.LOADLIB
        should both be empty.


3) Submit the following job to assemble the two programs used by
   the MODLISTR facility. The assemble and link should recieve
   a return code 0.  You will have to insert your installation's
   jobcard before you submit the job.

      SUB  'XXXXXXXX.MODLISTR.CNTL(INSTALL1)'

   This job assembles the two programs used by the MODLISTR facility:

        MODLISTR
        JUL2GREG

   Note, the object modules for these are also included in you would
   prefer to just Link the modules.

        MODLISTR  - $OBJECT1
        JUL2GREG  - $OBJECT2

4) Submit the following job to copy the MODLIST Rexx exec to your
   SYSPROC concatenation library.  You will have to insert your
   installation's jobcard before you submit the job.
   You can optionally copy a second Rexx exec to your SYSPROC
   concatenation library - Member ML.  This ML exec can front-end
   the MODLIST exec if you want to invoke MODLIST with a shorter
   alias-like name.

      SUB  'XXXXXXXX.MODLISTR.CNTL(INSTALL2)'

5) COPY and RENAME MEMBER 'XXXXXXXX.MODLISTR.CNTL(MODLISTH)' and
   COPY and RENAME MEMBER 'XXXXXXXX.MODLISTR.CNTL(CALLMODH)'
   into your ISPF facility Help library allocated to ddname
   SYSHELP. Rename the member to MODLISTR using the following job.
   You will have to insert your installation's jobcard before you
   submit the job.

      SUB  'XXXXXXXX.MODLISTR.CNTL(INSTALL3)'


   You are now ready to use the facility.

   From TSO, enter:

      MODLIST  modulename
      ML       modulename      (alias for MODLIST)

      CALLMODL modulename  LIB(Library_Name)
      CM       modulename  LIB(Library_Name)    (alias for MODLIST)
