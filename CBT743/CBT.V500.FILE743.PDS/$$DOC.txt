 04/26/2010 - V01.01.14

 Fixed a bug in the MODLIST Rexx Exec.  Changed the sysid
 (system name) from 3 characters displayed to 8 characters.

 04/06/2010 - V01.01.13

 Fixed a bug in the MODLISTR program.  It was not freeing buffer
 storage obtained by the INITBUF function. Corrected the storage
 leak by adding a FREEBUF function to the program:
    IEWBUFF FUNC=INITBUF

 04/06/2010 - V01.01.12

 Fixed a bug in the MODLIST exec.

 01/21/2010 - V01.01.12

 Modified MODLIST exec to use a temporary file for browsing the
 results with ISPF browse.

 06/12/2007 - V01.01.11

 ADDED "DA(dsname)" and DSN((dsname)" keyword paramters to the
 "MODLIST" Rexx exec to be used as alternate keyword parameters for
 the "LIB(dsname)" parameter to point to the library to be queried.

 05/31/2007 - V01.01.10

 INCREASED THE SIZE OF THE MODULE LENGTH DISPLAY FIELD AND THE
 EP ADDRESS DISPLAY FIELD FROM 6 to 8 HEX CHARACTERS.  THESE TWO
 FIELDS WERE ALSO EXPANDED IN THE 100 BYTE LINKAGE PARM RETURNED
 WHEN USING A SECOND LINKAGE RETURN PARAMETER FIELD IN THE CALLER
 PROGRAM (PROGRAM THAT CALLS MODLISTR).
 NOTE: THIS CHANGE WILL REQUIRE CHANGES TO THE CALLER PROGRAM SINCE
 THE SIZE OF THESE TWO FIELDS HAS BEEN CHANGED.

 EXAMPLE CALL FROM AN COBOL APPLICATION PROGRAM CALLING 'MODLISTR' AS
 A SUBROUTINE WITH TWO PARAMETERS:

     //SYSPRINT DD  SYSOUT=*
     //IEWLIB   DD  DISP=SHR,DSN=MY.LOADLIB
  where YOURPGM does...
      01 WS-MODLISTR          PIC X(8)  VALUE 'MODLISTR'.
      01 WS-MODULE-NAME       PIC X(8).
      01 WS-MODLISTR-RETURN-AREA.
         05 WS-RA-MODNAME-LEN PIC S9(4) COMP.
         05 WS-RA-MODNAME     PIC X(8).
         05 WS-RA-LK-GR-DATE  PIC X(10).
         05 WS-RA-LK-JUL-DATE PIC X(8).
         05 WS-RA-LK-TIME     PIC X(8).
         05 WS-RA-MODULE-LEN  PIC X(8).
         05 WS-RA-AMODE       PIC X(3).
         05 WS-RA-RMODE       PIC X(3).
         05 WS-RA-APFCD       PIC X(2).
         05 WS-RA-RENT        PIC X(2).
         05 WS-RA-REUS        PIC X(2).
         05 WS-RA-REFR        PIC X(2).
         05 WS-RA-TTR         PIC X(6).
         05 WS-RA-EPA         PIC X(8).
         05 WS-RA-ORG-POE     PIC X(1).
         05 WS-RA-TRUE-NAME   PIC X(8).
         05 WS-RA-SSI         PIC X(8).
         05 FILLER            PIC X(11).

      CALL WS-MODLISTR USING WS-MODULE-NAME,
                             WS-MODLISTR-RETURN-AREA.

  (WS-MODULE-NAME must be padded with trailing blanks)
  RESULTS ARE NOT WRITTEN TO FILE SYSPRINT
  Instead, the results are returned in WS-MODLISTR-RETURN-AREA
  (a 100 byte return parameter from MODLISTR).

  From an Assembler program:
      MODNAME   DS  CL8
      RETNAREA  DS  CL100
      CALL MODLISTR,(MODNAME,RETNAREA),VL

 03/19/2007 - V01.01.09

 CORRECTED ERROR WHEN REASON CODE 83000514 IS RETURNED FROM THE
 BINDER INCLUDE FUNCTION.  ALLOW "MODULE NOT FOUND IN LIBRARY"
 MESSAGE TO BE DISPLAYED.

 02/09/2007 - V01.01.08

 CORRECTED THE ERROR DIAGNOSTICS DISPLAY FOR A FAILED BINDER INCLUDE
 FUNCTION.

 01/02/2007 - V01.01.07

 ADDED THE 'CALLMODL' AND 'BIGLGET' REXX EXECS FOR TESTING.
 ADDED SSI INFORMATION DISPLAY.

 09/27/2006 - V01.01.06

 CORRECTED THE RELOCATION OF THE RDJFCB MACRO.  IT WORKED OK AS
 IT WAS.  I WAS USING FILED 'JFCBAR' AS THE MACRO RELOCATE AREA AND
 FOR THE WORK BUFFER AREA.  I BROKE THIS UP INTO TWO FIELDS.

 08/28/2006 - V01.01.05

 ADDED A MACRO CALLED "HOWCALLD" TO BE USED IN PROGRAM "MODLISTR".
 THE MACRO DETERMINS HOW THE PROGRAM WAS CALLED BY THE CALLER.

 Modification Level: V01.01.04

 Corrected the spelling of a few comments in the code.

 Modification Level: V01.01.03

 THIS PROGRAM ISSUES THE IEWBIND (BINDER) MACRO TO OBTAIN LINK-EDIT
 INFORMATION FOR DISPLAY FOR A PARTICULAR LOAD MODULE MEMBER AND
 DISPLAYS IT IN ISPF BROWSE.

 THE MODLIST EXEC CALLS THIS PROGRAM - TKMILLE 05/31/2006

     Examples:  MODLIST  modulename
                MODLIST  modulename   { dup }
                ML       modulename

 CHANGE LOG (See member $CHANGES).

 06/16/2006 - V01.01.01 Base Code

 I PICKED THIS PROGRAM UP FROM THE WWW.XEPHON.COM WEB SITE (PROGRAM
 'POBJINFO' AND ADDED TO IT.  ADDED A CALL TO PROGRAM 'JUL2GREG'
 TO OBTAIN THE GREGORIAN DATE FROM THE JULIAN LINK-EDIT DATE.
 CHANGED THE 'TPUT' MACROS TO 'PUT' TO SYSPRINT MACROS.

 ADDED 3 ADDITIONAL LINES OF DISPLAY (SEE BELOW) INCLUDING THE
 FOLLOWING FIELDS OBTAINED FROM THE PDS OR PDS/E MEMBER'S DIRECTORY
 RECORD:

 AMODE, RMODE, APF AUTH CODE, REENTRANT ATTR, REUSE ATTR, REFRESH
 ATTR, TTR LOCATION, EPA ADDRESS, MEMBER'S DASD RESIDENT LOCATION
 VOLSER/DATASET NAME, DSORG OF LIBRARY, AND ALIAS' TRUENAME (IF
 THE MEMBER IS AN ALIAS NAME.

 IT DISPLAYS 3 OR 4 LINES OF INFORMATION ON DDNAME 'SYSPRINT'
 (4 LINES IF THE MEMBER IS AN ALIAS NAME):
 TO A WORK DATASET USING ISPF BROWSE TO DISPLAY THE RESULTS.

   MEMBERNAME, LINKEDIT DATE (BOTH JULIAN AND GREGORIAN DATE),
   LINKEDIT TIME, LENGTH OF THE LOAD MODULE, AMODE, RMODE,
   APF AUTH CODE, REENTRANT ATTR, REUSE ATTR, REFRESH ATTR,
   TTR LOCATION, EPA ADDRESS, MEMBER'S DASD RESIDENT LOCATION
   VOLSER/DATASET NAME, DSORG OF LIBRARY, AND ALIAS' TRUENAME (IF
   THE MEMBER IS AN ALIAS NAME (DISPLAYED ON LINE 4).

   ALSO MODIFIED THE PROGRAM TO BE REENTRANT.

   OUTPUT FILES: //SYSPRINT (3 or 4 Line Display)

   RETURN CODES FROM MODLISTR:

   0      => Successful call to MODLISTR
   4,8,12 => Various other return codes/reason codes from IEWBIND,
               OBTAIN, AND RDJFCB macros.

  Added Mark Zelden's "LPROG" exec code into this MODLIST exec
  to search for a module in the dynamic LNKLST and in the LPA.
  Therefore, a module in storage can be searched and displayed.
  (or duplicate module entries in the LinkList and LPA).

                 DATE RETURNED WILL BE BLANKS AND THE PROGRAM WILL
                 COMPLETE WITH RC=12.




  MODLIST exec Syntax:

            MODLIST modulename { DUP      }
            ML                 { ALL      }
                               { LPA      }
                               { LINK     }
                               { LIST     }
                               { LIB(dsname)  }
                                      {VOL(vvvvvv)     }
                                      {UNIT(xxxxxxxx)  }


      Modulename - The modulename to be searched.  This parameter
                   must always be specified and must precede the
                   subparameters.


      Subparameter Values and Explanations:

      DUP        - Include duplicate entries.  Look for the module
                   more than one load library. If the LPA and LINK
                   subparameters are not included, the facility
                   will look for all modules having this name in the
                   scope of the LPA libraries and in the Linklist.

      ALL        - Same as DUP.

      LPA        - Look for the module in the LPA list of load
                   libraries.  If the subparameter DUP or ALL is
                   also included, it will list all of the entries
                   with this modulename within the scope of the
                   LPA List of load libraries.

      LINK       - Look for the module in the LinkList of load
                   libraries.  If the subparameter DUP or ALL is
                   also included, it will list all of the entries
                   with this modulename within the scope of the
                   LinkList of load libraries.

      LIST       - This subparameter will list all of the LPA
                   libraries and LinkList libraries.  When this
                   subparamter is specified, the modulename must
                   also be included ahead of the LIST parameter.
                   However, the modulename parameter is ignored, so
                   it can be a dummy modulename such as 'X'.

      LIB(dsname)- This subparameter tells the facilitiy to search
                   only this Load Library for the modulename.

      VOL(vvvvvv)- This subparameter can be used with the LIB
                   subparameter to specify the Volser that the
                   specified library resides on.

      UNIT(xxxxx)- This subparameter can be used with the LIB and
                   VOL subparameters to specify the UNIT of the
                   specified Volser of the library.



 ASSUMPTIONS
 -----------

   THIS FACILITY ASSUMES THE USE OF THE HIGH-LEVEL ASSEMBLER TO
   ASSEMBLE THE TWO SOURCE PROGRAMS.

   REXX EXEC 'CALLMODL' (USED FOR TESTING PROGRAM MODLISTR) ASSUMES
   THAT THE EXTENDED DYNAMIC STEPLIB FACILITY PROVIDED BY CA-TSOPLUS
   IS INSTALLED TO GIVE AN ALLOCATION FOR DDNAME "STEPLIBX".
   OTHERWISE THE USER MUST CODE HIS OWN STEPLIB ALLOCATION IN LIEU
   OF USING CA-TSOPLUS'S SOLUTION.


 CERTIFICATION
 -------------

 BATCH:

   IT HAS BEEN CERTIFIED WITH Z/OS 1.7.
