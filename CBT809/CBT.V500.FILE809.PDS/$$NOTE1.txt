Sam,

DITTO was written mostly for round reel tape.

In order for DITTO to do its thing, it needs to bypass OPEN.
Mostly this keeps the system from issuing a rewind-unload on
tapes.

At times you needed to manually position a tape, then copy or
print data from that point.  Normal system open issues the
rewind-unload for security.  It also needed to allow I/O
anywhere on a DASD device.  It was building a DEB and adding it
to the DEB chain using a "DEBCHK  TYPE=ADD".

When I wrote DITTO, there was no such thing as 31-bit mode.
Somewhere along the way IBM changed the Internals for I/O and
DITTO would cause the system to crash.  I found that if EXCP is
issued in key zero, the system allows you to use A DEB that has
not been added to the DEB chain via the "DEBCHK  TYPE=ADD".  So,
DITTO still does its fake OPEN, but does not Issue a DEBCHK.
Instead it builds a DEB, switches to key zero, issues the EXCP,
then switches back to user key.  I tried it on our System for
DASD operations.  It worked and has never caused the system to
crash.

I cannot check tape commands.  All our physical tape drives are
in a robotic system.  Because DITTO bypasses OPEN, the tape
system does not know to mount the tape.
