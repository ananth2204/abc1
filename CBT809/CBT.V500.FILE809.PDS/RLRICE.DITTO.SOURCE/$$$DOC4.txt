Ditto as developed (mostly) around 1984-1985 or so.  Before MVS/XA,
MVS/ESA, OS/390, z/OS, 31-bit mode...

DITTO was written when most tapes were still the 3420 "round reels".
Anyone who was around then knows that there was no end to the way
a round-reel tape could be botched.  Every now and then you needed
to get the normal access methods and system out of the way so you
could 'see' what was on a tape or try to salvage data.  DITTO allowed
you to position the tape with no regard for tape labels (sometimes
they were what was botched), tape marks, whatever.  You can print,
copy the tape, write tape marks, forward space, back space, skip
tape marks, whatever at any time.

To do its job, DITTO 'bends' some rules.  For one it builds its
own DEB.  It would then issue a DEBCHK to add the DEB to the
DEB chain.  Somewhere around MVS/ESA this started causing the
entire system to crash.  I have learned that if you issue an EXCP
while in key 0, the system allows you to provide a DEB that is
not on the DEB chain.  I have removed the code that does the DEBCHK
and switch to key 0 immediately before issuing EXCPs.  Both DEBCHK
and switching to key 0 require APF authorization.
