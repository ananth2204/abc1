//***FILE 959 is from Richard W. Pinion and contains a program      *   FILE 959
//*           to release excess space from a list of datasets (by   *   FILE 959
//*           name), without affecting the last-access date.        *   FILE 959
//*           This program uses the PARTREL macro from SYS1.MACLIB. *   FILE 959
//*                                                                 *   FILE 959

//*           The UCB lookup in this program uses the ULUT          *   FILE 959
//*           (UCB Lookup Table) method, from CBT File 873, that    *   FILE 959
//*           was pioneered by Gilbert Saint-flour.  Please see     *   FILE 959
//*           member $ULUNOTE for some background on this subject,  *   FILE 959
//*           which is not documented by IBM.  The easy-to-use      *   FILE 959
//*           UCB Lookup Table macros were written by Sam Golob.    *   FILE 959

//*       The PARTREL program takes input in the //INDD DD name     *   FILE 959
//*       with the dataset name starting in column1, and optionally *   FILE 959
//*       the volser of the dataset, which is necessary if the      *   FILE 959
//*       dataset is uncataloged, starting (for 6 characters)       *   FILE 959
//*       in column 45.                                             *   FILE 959

//*       Model JCL for the //INDD DD card is as follows:           *   FILE 959
//*       Please  make sure that the "ruler" comment card does not  *   FILE 959
