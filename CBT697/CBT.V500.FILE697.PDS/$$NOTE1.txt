Sam,

Would you please look this over to see if it is worth putting on
the CBT Tape?

This is a system to load CICS CSD (RDO) information into a
PostgreSQL database on a Linux system.

The file is a TSO XMIT of a PDS (LRECL=80 RECFM=FB) which contains
four members. The first is a documentation member named $DOC. The
second is JCL to run the IBM supplied (in source) program
DFH0FORC. The third is sample installation JCL called RECEIVE. The
last is named TARFILE and contains an XMIT of a z/OS sequential
file (LRECL=1 RECFM=FB). This sequential file is a "tar" archive
containing a number Linux/UNIX files.
