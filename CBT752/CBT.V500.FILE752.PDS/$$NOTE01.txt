Mine will dump the ____PROF and all related tables for the applid
within the ISPPROF DDname. The applid is either specified (can
include "wild cards") or is the current applid.

Problem is the routine requires SCCPDSD from my toolkit (file
520). You still want it Sam?

Apart from the required subroutine SCCPDSD, there is only the
rexx exec.  I have attached it as clear text.
