Sam,

As promised, here s an update for my problem with file 752.

I created a replacement call for Robin's assembler routine, using
an old rexx routine, #MEMLIST, written by Rollin Coville.

This way, all code is in rexx, so far easier to install.

Attached are the APPLDUMP and #MEMLIST rexx routines. Be sure to
modify APPLDUMP to point to your PROFILE library in line

"pds = uid || '.ISPF.PROFILE'".

Give it a try if you'd like. Just go to ISPF 6, and enter

EX 'your.rexx.lib.REXX(appldump)' 'dsnx'
where dsnx (or dsn* for wildcard) is your applPROF member(s).

    Hi, Sam. I just tweaked the hex values on some of the panel
    settings. Just an issue with the  Reflections  3270 emulator,
    nothing about the file itself.  (about File 754)

    On 752, I'm attempting to use some code I had previously to
    replace the SCCPDSD code. We'll see how that goes. If I get
    it working, I will send it to you.

    Thanks for everything, and all the best to you and your
    family also.

 Subject: CBT files 752 and 754

 Sam,
 Thanks for all that you do to keep the CBT tape going. I hope
 that the mainframe IT community appreciates it as much as I do.

 I have unloaded and used many of the files that are on the tape
 without issue, but I have had issues with the above mentioned
 files.

 Unfortunately, both files are from people that are long retired,
 and outside the U.S. (Canada and Sweden) so no assistance is
 available.

 On 752, there is no JCL for doing the compile for the various
 assembler/link edits and no mention of specific parms. Too bad
 the load library wasn't included as a separate file.

 On 754, for whatever reason, I'm having issues with the panels.
 It's probably related to the hex conversions during the
 upload/downloads. I've been able to overcome similar issues
 previously, but for whatever reason not this time. Displaying
 the panels returns a RC=20, severe error. Not very descriptive
 or specific.

 I was wondering if you have implemented either/both of these and
 if you had any issues with them. Any assistance would be
 appreciated.

 Thanks,
