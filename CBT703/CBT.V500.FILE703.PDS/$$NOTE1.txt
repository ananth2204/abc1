Subject: Fujitsu/Siemens PFD Statistics and ISPF/RPF


Greetings everyone.

Recently, I had to get a large amount of source code from a
Fujitsu MSP system to MVS.

I discovered that the Statistics did not show in the RPF editor,
nor ISPF.

Google didn't show much, but there was mention of a LISTPDS and
REVIEW programs that apparently used the Fujitsu statistics.

However, none of the utilities seemed to work, and so I decided
the best way out was to write a utility that would convert the
PDS Member Entries to the correct format.

The program is here:

or at my website: http://www.ozemail.com.au/~oscarptyltd

Please note it is a one off program, and not fully fire-proofed,
bug-proofed or anything else.

However, I hope it will be useful to some others in the same or
similar boat.

Cheers,

Clem Clarke
