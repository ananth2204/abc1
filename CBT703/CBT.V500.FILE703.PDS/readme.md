//***FILE 703 is from Clem Clarke and contains a program to         *   FILE 703
//*           convert the member statistics for pds members         *   FILE 703
//*           created on a Fujitsu system, into ISPF statistics.    *   FILE 703
//*           Besides its utility value as created, this program    *   FILE 703
//*           can be used as a learning tool for manipulating       *   FILE 703
//*           pds directory entries.                                *   FILE 703

//*     Recently, I had to get a large amount of source code        *   FILE 703
//*     from a Fujitsu MSP system to MVS.                           *   FILE 703
//*                                                                 *   FILE 703
//*     I discovered that the Statistics did not show in the        *   FILE 703
//*     RPF editor, nor ISPF.                                       *   FILE 703
//*                                                                 *   FILE 703
//*     Google didn't show much, but there was mention of a         *   FILE 703
//*     LISTPDS and REVIEW programs that apparently used the        *   FILE 703
//*     Fujitsu statistics.                                         *   FILE 703
//*                                                                 *   FILE 703
//*     However, none of the utilities seemed to work, and so I     *   FILE 703
//*     decided the best way out was to write a utility that        *   FILE 703
//*     would convert the PDS Member Entries to the correct         *   FILE 703
//*     format.                                                     *   FILE 703
//*                                                                 *   FILE 703
