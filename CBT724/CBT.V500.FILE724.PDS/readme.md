//***FILE 724 is from Ed Jaffe and contains his improvements to     *   FILE 724
//*           IBM's HLASM Toolkit.  Some other HLASM-related tools  *   FILE 724
//*           are also included, such as the ASMFLOW program that   *   FILE 724
//*           cleans and prettifies Assembler source code.          *   FILE 724
//*                                                                 *   FILE 724

//*       These modifications were dramatically simplified after    *   FILE 724
//*       APAR PK01283, since IBM adopted most of my suggestions.   *   FILE 724
//*                                                                 *   FILE 724
//*       The only modification remaining is the NEXTWHEN macro.    *   FILE 724
//*       This macro allows you to pass control from one WHEN       *   FILE 724
//*       clause to the next WHEN clause or the OTHRWISE clause.    *   FILE 724
//*                                                                 *   FILE 724
