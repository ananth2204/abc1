//***FILE 732 is Chuck Hoffman's version of the TSO WHOHAS command  *   FILE 732
//*           which is familiar to many of us.  It seems to have    *   FILE 732
//*           disappeared from the regular CBT Tape, or at least    *   FILE 732
//*           I have not been able to find it there, yet.  Anyway,  *   FILE 732
//*           I'm making sure it is available again by putting it   *   FILE 732
//*           here.                                                 *   FILE 732
//*                                                                 *   FILE 732
//*           I did find that this command might be similar to the  *   FILE 732
//*           SYSDSN command on Chuck Hoffman's file, File 160.     *   FILE 732
//*                                                                 *   FILE 732
//*           email:  sbgolob@cbttape.org                           *   FILE 732
//*                   sbgolob@attglobal.net                         *   FILE 732
