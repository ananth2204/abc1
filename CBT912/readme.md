//***FILE 912 is from Don Higgins, and contains a set of his        *   FILE 912
//*           macros, structured and general purpose, which he      *   FILE 912
//*           updated for his z390 assembler project in 2008        *   FILE 912
//*           or thereabouts.  Most of these are updates to Don's   *   FILE 912
//*           old macros which were on the SPLA MVS tape in former  *   FILE 912
//*           years, and which have been preserved on the CBT       *   FILE 912
//*           Overflow Tape, File 178.                              *   FILE 912
//*                                                                 *   FILE 912
//*           This file, with (almost) each member being in         *   FILE 912
//*           IEBUPDTE (really PDSLOAD) format, consists of Don's   *   FILE 912
//*           macros and COPY members to deploy them.  The entire   *   FILE 912
//*           CBT Overflow Tape File 178 has also been included,    *   FILE 912
//*           as member SPLAFILE.  Most of the programs have dates  *   FILE 912
//*           on them, so you can see what is newer or older, if    *   FILE 912
//*           there is duplication of program or macro names.       *   FILE 912
//*                                                                 *   FILE 912
//*           SPM      - Structured Programming macros              *   FILE 912
//*           SPMCPY   - COPY members associated with SPM           *   FILE 912
//*           MACS     - Don's other macros                         *   FILE 912
//*           MACSCPY  - COPY members associated with MACS          *   FILE 912
//*           SPLAFILE - The entire CBT Overflow Tape File 178      *   FILE 912
//*                                                                 *   FILE 912
//*           All macros have been translated from ASCII to EBCDIC. *   FILE 912
//*                                                                 *   FILE 912
//*           There is a lot of study material here, especially     *   FILE 912
//*           in the programs that are in member SPLAFILE.  Most    *   FILE 912
//*           old Assembler techniques never die.                   *   FILE 912

//*           You are supposed to make pds'es out of each member    *   FILE 912
//*           in this file.  Use the PDSLOAD program from File 093  *   FILE 912
//*           or use the helpful members copied here.               *   FILE 912
