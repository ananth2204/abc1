QSMS
====
QSMS maps the current sms-configuration and extracts the storagegroup
of every SMS-defined DASD. QSMS runs as a TSO-Command or can be called
as a Rexx-Function.  When called as a TSO-Command, QSMS returns the
Volumename, Storagegroup, Unitaddress, SMS-status and MVS-status. The
output is passed via putline, so it can "Outtraped". If called as a
Rexx-Function, an three-dimensional array of Rexx-variables is returned.
Specify the desired stemname as a parm. QSMSREXX shows you a sample call
Restriction: the passed stemname may not exceed 32 characters in length.
Returned variables per arrayelement: (xxxx = stemname, i=element)

     xxxx.vol_ser.i  = Volser
     xxxx.stor_grp.i = Storagegroup of Volser
     xxxx.dev_nr.i   = Unitaddress of Volser
     xxxx.sms_stat.i = SMS-status of Volser
     xxxx.mvs_stat.i = MVS-status of Volser
     xxxx.0          = # of elements returned
