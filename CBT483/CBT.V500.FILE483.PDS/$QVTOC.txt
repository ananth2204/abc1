QVTOC
=====
QVTOC reads the VTOC of every online dasd and builds a list of all
loadlibs (DSORG=PO, RECFM=U LRECL=0). Afterwards, the directoryblocks
of these loadlibs are read and a list of all loadmodules, aliases,
libraries and volsers is built. This list is then sorted by modulename.

Restrictions: Neither PDSEs nor HFSes are processed (yet).
-------------
QVTOC needs "READ" access to all libraries that are to be scanned. In
our shop, we run the QVTOC-job with the DMS-BACKUP userid as the OWNER
instead of granting access to all potential users of QVTOC.

AIACCTAB is a filterprogram, initially written for accounting purposes,
that can be called by QVTOC to reduce the amount of dasd and/or libs to
be scanned. AIACCTAB checks an entity against a filtervalue (best match-
ing logic) and returns the value associated to the filtervalue.
With QVTOC, the value to be returned is either "DROP" (bypass) or
"PROCESS". The DDNAME of the filterdataset is passed as parameter of
the first call to AIACCTAB.

Following rules apply for the filters:
**     <= general wildcard, (0-n qualifiers with dsns, "default" setting
*      <= wildcard for 1 qualifier or parts of 1 qualifier.
%      <= wildcard for 1 character (alphanumeric, may not be blank)
?      <= wildcard for 1 character (numeric, may not be blank)

Sample for the volumefilter:
//VOLFILT   DD  *        DDNAME is passed at 1st call
;  AIACCTB - TABLE       commentline
KEYLEN=006,ARGLEN=007    length of key/length of argument returned
                         this line MUST be the first dataline.
;  START OF DATA-PORTION  commentline
**    ,PROCESS           "Default": Scan all volumes
DMS*  ,DROP              bypass all volumenames starting with "DMS"
%%%VIO,DROP              bypass all volumenames ending with "vio"
*9?   ,DROP              bypass all volumes ending with 90-99
;---+----1----+----2----+----3----+----4----+---  (commentline)         --+----8

Sample for the loadlibfilter:
KEYLEN=044,ARGLEN=007
;---+----1----+----2----+----3----+----4----+---  (commentline)         --+----8
**                                          ,PROCESS   default
SYS%.LINK*                                  ,DROP
SYS?.LINK*                                  ,PROCESS   incl. sys1.link
**.LOAD*                                    ,PROCESS   0-n quals, +load*

The "default"-entry is not mandatory, if there is no match, the entity
is processed. Activate the //ACTTRACE DD to see whether there was a
match, and if yes, which filterentry matched.
