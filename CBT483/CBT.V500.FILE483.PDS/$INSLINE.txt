INSLINE
=======
Insline is an editmacro that lets you add lines (empty or with data)
selectively into a dataset or member.
accepted parameters are:
<FROM>   first line to be inserted. can be a number,label or .z-var
         default: 1
<TO>     last line to be inserted. can be a number, label or .zvar
         default: .zlast
<BY>     gap between the lines to be inserted. must be a number.
         default: 1 (insert 1 line, jump over 1 dataline, insert next)
<MODE>   either 'X' (for excluded lines) or 'NX' (not excluded)
         default: none

after entering the command, you are prompted to enter the data you'd
like to have inserted, and, if caps are OFF, whether you'd like it in
uppercase.
