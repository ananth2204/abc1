QLPAR
=====
QLPAR issues a DIAGNOSE x'204' to receive information of all currently
defined partitions. It returns # of processors, # of partitions, weigh-
tening factors and whether the resources are capped. The results are
returned via PUTLINE, so they can be trapped by Rexx.

Requirements: QLPAR needs APF-authorization and has to be put in the
              AUTHCMD-field of IKJTSOxx.
              QLPAR should reside in a LNKLST-concatenated library
