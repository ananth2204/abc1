The MAXITRAN EXEC was created to support file transfer between
the MAXIMO server and the MVS server.  It can be also be used by
other applications for scripted file transfer between MVS and an
FTP server, such as Windows.

Narrative
MAXITRAN currently uses FTP for file transfer.
The program operates as follows:

Messages from MAXITRAN are written to:
The SYSTSPRT dataset.
The LOG dataset, if present in the JCL.
Email messages sent as a result of EMAIL keywords.

All SYSIN control cards are read. If any keywords are
unrecognized, execution terminates.

GETMASK request are translated to individual GET requests.

All FILEEXISTS statements are executed. If any FILEEXISTS file
not found, RC 4 is set and MAXITRAN execution terminates.

If any GET requests; If a getlock is specified (see GETLOCK
keyword below) test for the presence of the lock file  on the
server GETDIR.  If the lock is found, execution terminates.

All GET requests are executed. If any GET fails, execution
terminates

If keyword GETDELETE=YES (defaut) then all files that were GET
are deleted from the server directory.

If any PUT requests; If a putlock is specified (see PUTLOCK
keyword below) test for the presence of the lock file  on the
server PUTDIR.  If the lock is found, execution terminates. Note
that the default for PUTLOCK is blank, that is the PUTDIR will be
considered locked if it has any files.

All PUT requests are executed. If any PUT fails, execution
terminates.

JCL
To execute MAXITRAN, use the following JCL:
//T1      EXEC MAXITRAN
//LOG      DD  DSN=log.file,DISP=MOD  Optional log file
//SYSIN    DD  *

Messages will be printed to ddname SYSTSPRT which is included in
the MAXITRAN PROC.

DDname LOG is an optional sequential file to accumulate a copy of
messages from MAXITRAN.

MAXITRAN is controlled by commands in the SYSIN dataset. All
SYSIN cards are processed  before any transfers take place.
Except for GET and PUT, each keyword should appear no more than
once.

Cards may be continued by ending a parameter with "," and
continuing the parameter on the next card.

An '*' in column 1 of any SYSIN card indicates a comment.



Sample MAXITRAN Job

//T1      EXEC MAXITRAN
//LOG      DD  DSN=WTS03.MAXILOG,DISP=MOD
//SYSIN    DD  *
SERVER UPIFILE1
PUTDIR MAXIMO-IN
GETDIR MAXIMO-OUT
EMAIL-ON-ERROR ROB@USSPOSCO.COM
LOCSITE TRACKS PRIMARY=1 SECONDARY=2 LRECL=200 RECFM=VB BLKSIZE=0
GET PO.TXT WTS03.XS1.MAXOUT.PO(+1)
GET INV.TXT WTS03.XS1.MAXOUT.INV(+1) LOCSITE LRECL=80 RECFM=FB
PUT WTS03.XS1.MAXIN.PO(0) PO.TXT
PUT WTS03.XS1.MAXIN.INV(0) INV.TXT




All SYSIN statements should begin in column 1 of the record and
may extend to the end of the record.  Statements may be continued
to a new record by ending the statement with a comma. Column 1 of
the continuation record will be overlayed at the position of the
comma.

An "*" in column 1 indicates a comment card.

SYSIN Keywords:

EMAIL-ON-ERROR address ...
Optional. Default: none
Email address(es) to send error reports to if MAXITRAN ends with
RC greater than 4. Addresses should be of the form
"name@domain.com".

EMAIL-ON-SUCCESS address ...
Optional. Default: none
Email address(es) to send error reports to if MAXITRAN ends
normally. Addresses should be of the form "name@domain.com".

FILEEXISTS dir/serverfile
Optional. Default: none
FILEEXISTS tests for the existence of serverfile in directory
dir. If the file is found, RC 0 is set. If the file is not found,
RC 4 is set.
dir is relative to the server FTP directory.
serverfile may be a complete filename or a mask (*.*).
Note: Filenames are case sensitive.

GET serverfile mvsfile  locsitestmt  (REPLACE |  (APPEND
Optional. Default: none
serverfile is the file on the server to be transferred to
mvsfile. The full pathname ofserverfile is the value of GETDIR
(if specified) + serverfile.
locsitstmt are optional allocation parms (see locsite keyword) to
use for this GET request.
(REPLACE indicates the mvsfile should be replaced if it already
exists.
(APPEND indicates data should be added to the end (DISP=MOD) of
mvsfile if mvsfile already exists.
mvsfile will be created if it does not exist.
The (APPEND and (REPLACE parameters are mutually exclusive. They
may not appear together on the same statement.

GETMASK serverfileMask rexxExpression locsitestmt  (REPLACE | (APPEND
Optional. Default: none
serverfileMask is the file on the server to be transferred to
MVS. Multiple files may be represented by wildcards.
servefileMask  is case sensitive.
The full pathname of serverfileMask is the value of GETDIR (if
specified) + serverfileMask.
rexxExpression is an expression in the rexx language that will be
executed to create the MVS target filename. The variable name
sfile may be used in this expression to represent the name of the
source file. The expression may not contain any embedded spaces.
The result of the expression will always be translated to upper
case to satisfy MVS dsname requirements.

rexxExpression may also contain MAXITRAN special REXX functions
as documented in the section "Special REXX Functions".

See the GET statement for an explanation of the locsitestmt,
(REPLACE and (APPEND parameters.

Example GETMASK:
GETMASK *.txt 'UPZZ.XS1.TRAN.'substr(sfile,2,3)'.DATA'

For a directory that contains these files:
arnold.txt
abcdefghijk.txt

The following GETs would be executed:
GET arnold.txt UPZZ.XS1.TRAN.RNO.DATA
GET abcdefghijk.txt UPZZ.XS1.TRAN.BCD.DATA


GETDIR dir
Optional. Default: null - the server FTP default directory will
be used.
Name of server directory where files will be transferred from
(GET).

GETDELETE YES | NO
Optional. Default: YES
YES indicates that serverfiles should be deleted after the GET is
completed. NO indicates serverfiles should not be deleted.

GETLOCK file-mask |  NO
Optional. Default: *.lck - file-mask specifies a filename on the
server. Wildcards may be used. The presence of this filename in
the GETDIR will be taken to mean that the server is locked and no
GETs will be executed.  NO indicates MAXITRAN should bypass lock
checking for the GETDIR.


LOCSITE allocparms
Optional. Default: none
Parameters to use for allocating new target datasets on MVS for a
GET request. Any keyword supported by the FTP LOCSITE subcommand
is supported. See TCPIP users guide for details.

Some common LOCSITE keywords:
TRACKS      - allocate dataset in tracks
CYLINDERS   - allocate dataset  in cylinders
PRIMARY n   - primary space allocation amount
SECONDARY n - secondary space allocation amount
RECFM  xx   - record format - VB, FB, etc
LRECL  nn   - logical record length


PUT mvsfile  serverfile
Optional. Default: none
mvsfile is the file to be transferred to serverfile.


PUTMASK mvsfileMask rexxExpression
Optional. Default: none
mvsfileMask is the MVS file to be transferred to the server.
Multiple files may be represented by wildcards.

rexxExpression is an optional expression in the rexx language
that will be executed to create the server target filename. The
variable name sfile may be used in this expression to represent
the name of the source file. The expression may not contain any
embedded spaces.

rexxExpression may also contain MAXITRAN special REXX functions
as documented in the section "Special REXX Functions".

Example PUTMASK:
PUTMASK UPZZ.XS1.TRAN.* 'coils.'substr(sfile,15,7)'.data'

For these MVS files:
UPZZ.XS1.TRAN.G0001V00
UPZZ.XS1.TRAN.G0002V00


The following PUTs would be executed:
PUT UPZZ.XS1.TRAN.G0001V00 coils.G0001V00.data
PUT UPZZ.XS1.TRAN.G0002V00 coils.G0002V00.data


PUTDIR dir
Optional. Default: null - the server FTP default directory will
be used.  Name of server directory where files will be
transferred to (PUT).

PUTLOCK file-mask |  NO
Optional. Default: null - file-mask specifies a filename on the
server. Wildcards may be used. The presence of this filename in
the PUTDIR will be taken to mean that the server is locked and no
PUTs will be executed. Note that the default of null means that
PUTs will only be executed if the target directory is empty.  NO
indicates MAXITRAN should bypass lock checking for he PUTDIR.


SERVER servername
Required. Default: none.
Name of the server which MVS will exchange files with.



Return Codes

Special REXX functions
The following functions are special to MAXITRAN and may be used
in as part of  rexxExpression in a GETMASK or PUTMASK statement:

counter()  represents a 4 digit counter value that is incremented
each time it is used bt GETMASK/PUTMASK to generate a GET/PUT
statement. The first call returns "0001".

hhmmss()  returns the current hours, minutes, seconds value. For
example: 142733.

yyyymmdd()  returns the year, month, date value. For
example: 20041029.

gdsversion(sfile)  returns the G0000V00 portion of the name from
sfile.

token(sfile,num,delim,maxLength) returns the num token from sfile
where delim seperates the tokens. The first token is num 1. The
token is truncated to maxlength before it is returned.

Examples:
 token('abcd.txt',1,'.',8)  returns => "abcd"
 token('somelongname.tuesday.data',1,'.',8) returns => "somelong"
 token('somelongname.tuesday.data',1,'.') returns => "tuesday"
