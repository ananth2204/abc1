//***FILE 957 is from Shmuel (Seymour J.) Metz, and contains the    *   FILE 957
//*           original source code for the IEBUPDTX program, his    *   FILE 957
//*           modifications and a very large collection of macros.  *   FILE 957
//*           This file represents a lot of complicated work done   *   FILE 957
//*           in the 1970s and early 1980's and which still is      *   FILE 957
//*           useful.                                               *   FILE 957

//*           Member IEBUPDOC is a decent introduction to how to    *   FILE 957
//*           use the IEBUPDTX program, which is an extension to    *   FILE 957
//*           both IEBUPDTE and the older IEBUPDAT programs from    *   FILE 957
