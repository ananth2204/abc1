Hello Sam,

This deals with my collection of "special DD names".  I wish that
this list will be added to.

For the moment:

http://www.ktomiak.biz/ORG/STUFF/mvsscp/JCL/DDNAMES.html

I wondered how the suggestion to send you a list of DDNAMES to
disable products would be implemented.  It is hardly worth a
separate file on the CBTTAPE.  As part of building what was
supposed to be a collection of utility jobs from the SHARE MVS
SCP Project, I also started building a collection of members for
JCL.  The initial cut comes out of the manuals.  Sadly, the IBM
utilities examples (in the manuals) are geared for the MVS 3.8
system and not how a z/OS shop ought to be running.  My
share.mvsscp.jcl.cntl PDSE has a member named DDNAMES that shows
what DDNAMEs are commonly used and by what.  I started adding
these 'bypass' ddnames to it.
