(I would prefer) a better $$NOTE member, giving credit where I
could associate a DDNAME with a person.  Sometimes multiple
submitters.  The note (should) begin with Alan (Schwartz)'s post
on IBM-MAIN, stating his intent.  I edited the text (of Alan's
first submission) to make it more professional.  After that are
the DDNAMES found in the responses, not in chronological order.
They are grouped by person.  Perhaps FILE762 should be attributed
to Alan.

(Please see member IGNOREDD with this actual info.  SG)

Here is Alan's original post to IBM-Main.....

Has anyone compiled a list of all the DD DUMMY ddnames used to
dynamically disable various products?  I want to generate a
comprehensive jcl set that I can include if I want to make sure
I'm running 100% IBM code when troubleshooting some problems.
For instance I know that ABNLIGNR disables ABEND-AID, FCOPYOFF
disables PDSMAN's fast copy.  Please contribute towards this
initiative.
