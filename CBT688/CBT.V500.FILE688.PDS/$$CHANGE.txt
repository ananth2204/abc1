Sam,

Here the file for the update version of the Rexx exec INITDBGN,
renamed to be DBRCINIT. The changes to the code are below. These
changes are documented in the program.

modified by Larry Altman(lda) 3/2005 (generally lower case char)

- made ALL code conform to my liking:
- aka lower case chars except for literals
- removed space surrounding operators, e.g. =, >, \=.
- changed all use of the INDEX function to the POS function
- for each init.db/dbds & if 'i' passed to the program
- generate NOTIFY.IC stmts with keyword values collected from the recon
- removed all code for FP Areas/ADS
- added code to support registered HALDBs.
- generate INIT.DB,INIT.PART, and NOTIFY.IC when 'I' is passed to the
  program.
- changed all use of '.' in variable names to '_' to prevent
  variable substitution.
- renamed to be dbrcinit(DBRC INIT statement generator)
- replaced the me() func with standard rexx func: userid()
