//* Two jobs in this member 0991 and 0992; 991 is intended to run
//* first AND 0991 should end before 992 starts.
//*
//* This may or MAY NOT work as intended, because 992 might get to
//*  the input queue first - if it does and 991 is not there yet, the
//*  shared spool mods ASSUME that 991 may have already run, and so
//*  992 will be allowed to execute first even though that is clearly
//*  not the intent!  To make sure they work correctly you can either
//*  add a " /*HOLDFOR 00:00:05 " card to both jobs, or have your
//*  Systems Programmer set SSM OPTIONS BEAFTER=DELAY and BATIME=5.
//*  The first option causes both of your jobs to wait on the input que
//*  for 5 seconds, almost guarenteeing that both jobs can be evaluated
//*  at the same time (fixing the problem).  The second option causes
//*  ALL JOBS to wait for an extra 5 seconds on the input - same thing
//*  but it is done for everyjob and you dont need to add /*WAITFOR
//*  statements.  Member SAMP0992 has a properly delayed before / after
//*  sample you can copy.

//* NOTE ->
//*
//*       This job has lots of comment statements -
//*
//*     it has lots of comments to try to make it hit the input
//*
//*     queue  * after *  T0SM0992 reaches the queue - a way to
//*
//*     show off the potential problem with submitting two jobs
//*
//*     each with a before or after statement to control the order
//*
//*     that the jobs run in.
