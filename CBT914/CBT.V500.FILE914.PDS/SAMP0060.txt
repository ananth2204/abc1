//*   TESTING /*CNTL RESNAME,prg
//* We test 'prg' cntl control by first submitting this group of jobs
//* that each needs exclusive control of the same resource name, this
//* causes them to all run one after the next - single threaded.
//*
//* After these jobs are submitted and running, we can submit the two
//* jobs in member SAMP0061, they are coded to use the same resource
//* but they have it coded as PRG.  This means that they will skip
//* ahead of other jobs and run with exclusive control, but ahead of
//* all other jobs that need the same resource in any state - exc, or
//* shr.
