//** INSERT/REMOVE/REPLACE SVC 167 support for #GETATB/#FREATB Services
//*
//*    This job was created for the purpose of installing the SVC
//*  that supports #GETATB and #FREATB macros.  These macros provide
//*  getmain and freemain services for above-the-bar storage.
//*
//*    We use SVC 167 for this purpose.  It's not currently used
//*  by IBM.  You may use another SVC if you like but then you will
//*  have to change the default in the macros #GETATB and #FREATB.
