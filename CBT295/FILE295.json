Not at all.\nSatisfying?  To a point.\n\n      I have worked with machines it seems all my life. I like the\nmachines, and what they have become in my lifetime. I have excelled\nin my craft. I have built abstract creations of such hidden beauty,\nworks of art as creative as any you might see. An art, though, that\nno one will see. An art that can be seen only by the mind's eye.\nImpossible for most. Too difficult for those few who can. People\nwith years of experience might have the vocabulary and language\nnecessary to understand, necessary to comprehend. But probably not\nthe patience or the interest. They have their own castles to build.\n\n      There is no color nor taste in it. No sound to hear, no\nobject to touch. There is nothing physical or material. There is\nonly the abstraction of concept, coded into thousands upon\nthousands of instructions-to-the-machine. Implemented, written,\nincorporated, coded, yet remaining abstract. Visualizable, but not\npicturable.  Hidden deep within the internals of digital systems.\n\n      Further up, layers upon layers away from this hidden beauty,\nthere is the final result. The display the user can see. The\noutput that he can touch and feel with his own mind. A good and\nuseful device in and of itself. But the concepts that make it\nwork? forever hidden in an unlit world of \"internals\".\n\n      When I code, I think with extreme intensity and focus. When I\nstop, I am both wired and exhausted. Decompression takes time.\n\n      When I code, my mind swims and flows in a world of\nabstractions.  There are no words. Only processes coming together,\nthen spawning apart again. A huge spaghetti-maze of logic paths\nflowing, splitting, diverging, merging. Each one needing to find\nits beginning, needing to seek its end. \"What about this?\" \"What\nif that?\" \"What will happen when?\" \"Oh shit! I forgot about THAT!\"\nThese are the constant urges that drive the coding process. Each\nof them giving rise to a branching of the logic paths. Each one\ngiving creation to the abstraction needed to resolve its question.\nEach one remaining a flaw until resolved and merged back into the\noverall flow of the program.\n\n      Occasionally, once in awhile, the solution to a path will be\nutterly new, the abstraction will be totally beautiful. Something\nto be proud of. Something to be satisfied with. Something I cannot\nshow or even explain to the people I love. Something that I am\nforced to keep ... private.\n\n      When I code, my mind swims and flows in a world of\nabstractions.  There are no words. \"What are you doing?\", someone\nwill ask. I cannot answer. The cost is too high. There are no\nwords at hand.  Only the mental flows of forms and processes.\n\"WHAT ARE YOU DOING?!\", someone insists. I have to stop. Let it\nall settle into ... stillness. Then maybe I can find the words,\nbut now the process is gone. That is the cost.\n\n      \"What about this?\" \"What if that?\" \"What will happen when?\"\n\"Oh shit! I forgot about THAT!\" But then suddenly comes the\nanswer: \"It is done!\" Suddenly, there is stillness. There is that\nperfect moment when you just know, in an inescapable way, there\nare no questions remaining. All the paths have been connected. All\nthe answers have been coded.\n\nThere is stillness. It is done.\n\n      You asked what I do. This is what I do. There is\nsatisfaction, but no comfort.\n\n= = =\n\nDavid Cole\nIn the 55th year of my life,\n36 of which have been devoted to programming,\n24 of which have been devoted to XDC.\n", "mimetype": "text/plain", "datatype": "ebcdic", "extension": ".txt"}}}}, "SCRIPTOPTIONS": {"filename": "./CBT295/FILE295.XMI", "LRECL": 80, "loglevel": 30, "outputfolder": "CBT295", "encoding": "cp1140", "unnum": true, "quiet": false, "force": false, "binary": false, "modifydate": true}}
