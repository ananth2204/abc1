The CUCI dialog USRCCONF, which sets defaults for ISPF settings not is ISPCCONF,
is an impotant addition to the colleciton.  ISPF administrators will now be able
to set defautls for the following settings not in ISPCCONF:

PF Keys and PF Key Labels
Calendar Options
MEMLIST, DSLIST, and UDLIST SRCHFOR Options
UDLIST Directory List and Mount Table Options
UDLIST Directory List Column Arrangement
UDLIST Mount Table by File System Column Arrangement
UDLIST Mount Table by Mount Point Column Arrangement

Enabling the support for these settings requires three things:

1 - Modify ISR@PRIM (or your primary option menu) to set the defaults.
2 - Generate a keyword file by executing the USRCCONF dialog.  The dialog is
    designed to look and act like ISPCCONF.  You can use your existing ISPF
    keyword file, but just be sure to use a different member name than the name
    you use for ISPF defaults.  I used "USRDEFLT" for testing purposes.
3 - Modify the USR@KYWD exec to specify the keyword file you defined in step 2.
    The file will be read at the beginning of each new TSO/ISPF session to
    determine if there is a new user, or if any settings should be FORCEd.

Future releases will add the following settings:

ZKIT=LO support in primay option menu for ISPF notepad
BROWSE/VIEW entry panel options
EDIT entry panel options
Entry panel options for various utility panels, such as 3.1, 3.4, etc.
