//***FILE 967 is the CBT Usermod Collection for ISPF (CUCI)         *   FILE 967

//* Tom Conley, formerly SHARE's ISPF Advocate (now defunct), is    *   FILE 967
//* establishing this collection to provide function that will in   *   FILE 967
//* all likelihoood not be provided by IBM.  IBM's investment in    *   FILE 967
//* ISPF has steadily dwindled since z/OS V2R1, while investment in *   FILE 967
//* z/OSMF has vastly increased.  There is still a user community   *   FILE 967
//* for ISPF that requires increased function.  The goal of this    *   FILE 967
//* collection will be to provide that function wherever possible.  *   FILE 967
//*                                                                 *   FILE 967
//* Functions provided to this collection must be in a standard     *   FILE 967
//* SMP/E usermod format.  Manual hacks will not be accepted.  It   *   FILE 967
//* is expected that the ISPF community will provide functions to   *   FILE 967
//* this collection with the foregoing in mind.                     *   FILE 967
//*                                                                 *   FILE 967
