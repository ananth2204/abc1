//***FILE 774 is from Richard L. Rice and contains a compression-   *   FILE 774
//*           decompression program that is similar in function     *   FILE 774
//*           to the CBT973 compression program which is used to    *   FILE 774
//*           make the (actual) CBT Tape.  This program extends     *   FILE 774
//*           the compression algorithm if all 80 bytes from the    *   FILE 774
//*           input record are the same.                            *   FILE 774
//*                                                                 *   FILE 774
//*           This program is not being used "officially" to        *   FILE 774
//*           produce the CBT Tapes (at this point), because some   *   FILE 774
//*           administrative issues have yet to be resolved.  But   *   FILE 774
//*           it is being presented here for the enjoyment of all.  *   FILE 774
//*           You can use it to decompress files from the existing  *   FILE 774
//*           CBT Tapes.                                            *   FILE 774
