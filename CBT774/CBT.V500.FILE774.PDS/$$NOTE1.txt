Sam,
This is a small extension to the CBT compression.
It hit me that in the right situation, a source type record could be
'compressed' to 1 byte.  If the compressed data length is exactly 5,
Then it means that the entire record contains the same character in all
80 bytes.  All you need to save is the character that is repeated.

The advantage is that the output will always be the same or smaller..
Never
Larger than the compression being used now and the decompress will
Still work for any data already compressed by the older technique.
