DEVSUPxx -

DEVSUPxx (device support options)

DEVSUPxx specifies the installation default for device support
options. DEVSUPxx is processed during the NIP phase of IPL. After
IPL, customers can use system command SET DEVSUP=XX to activate
the DEVSUP changes.

Considerations:

    The DGNB control block is dependent on system level.  The level
    of this DGNB is a display number of one byte, at +4 off the
    beginning of the control block, just after the header letters,
    "DGNB".  Format:  C'0n'

    Once we know the level of this DGNB control block, we know its
    format, provided we have a copy of the IGVDGNB macro which is
    at this level.
