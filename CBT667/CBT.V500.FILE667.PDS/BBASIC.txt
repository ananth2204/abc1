RPG Tutorial: Basic statement types (Header/File/Input/Output)


RPG source statements consist of a relatively small set of
rigidly formatted specification statements.  Because RPG programs
can be complex, and deal with complex collections of data, the
formats of the specifications can, at first glance, seem
overwhelming.  However, the specifications are designed to be
able to handle a large range of needs, so in actual practice any
individual program will only require entries to be made in a
small number of the fields.

Since I am intending for this to be an introductory tutorial, I
have not covered every entry possible in every specification
field.  For example, I have not covered combined reader/punch
files since it is unlikely that under Hercules/MVT anyone will be
dealing with physical card devices.  If you come to the end of
the material I have presented here and find that you have needs
beyond what I have covered, try the nearest university library.
You will be amazed at the books that are tucked away in some of
the stacks gathering dust.

Although the number of specifications has been increased with the
later extensions (RPG II, RPG III, and RPG IV), the RPG Debugging
Template I acquired back in 1973 (I still have two well-worn
copies) defines only ten types of specification.  Of those ten, a
simple program may be written using only four:

   1. Header
   2. File Description
   3. Input
   4. Output

Columns one through five of any specification statement are
traditionally used for sequence numbers, with the first two
digits typically containing the coding sheet page number and the
last three digits containing the statement number within that
page.  Like all other languages, once we started moving away from
physical cards, the sequence numbers lost some of their utility
and were omitted most of the time.  The default behavior of the
MVT RPG compiler is to not sequence check the source, so you may
leave the first five columns of each statement blank.

Column six of the specification statement designates the type - H
for Header, F for File Description, I for Input, and O for
Output.  The order the specification statements must occur in
when processed by the compiler is:

   1. Header
   2. File Description
   3. Extension
   4. Line Counter
   5. Input
   6. Calculation
   7. Output

All specifications of an individual type are processed together.
So, there should be a single Header specification, followed by
one or more File description specifications, and so on through
the Output specifications.

Column seven of any specification statement may contain an
asterisk (*) to designate a comment.  The contents of the card
will be printed on the compiler listing and otherwise ignored.
However, the specification type (column six) must be correct and
in the correct order (as shown above).

Header Specification

The Header specification statement provides the overall
characteristics of the program and its operating environment.
Most of the fields had much more significance on the earlier
(smaller) IBM 360 series mainframes or on the later System/3 (and
other minicomputers) than they do for RPG programs written to run
under OS/360.  I do remember using some of the fields when I was
writing programs on a System/3, but 99% of the time all entries
are left blank.  However, the presence of the Header
specification is mandatory, so you must include the card with an
'H' in column six.

The only significant entry for RPG I is the program name, which
may be entered in columns 75-80.  If provided, this will be the
name used for the object program (the name of the CSECT, or
control section).  If omitted, the name of the program will be
the default: RPGOBJ.

File Description Specification

The File Description specification statement provides the
characteristics of the files to be read and/or written by the
program.  No file will use every entry in the file specification
and only an indexed sequential (ISAM) disk file will use a
significant number of entries.

Column(s)   Field Name           Use
7 - 14      File Name            name of file used internally and in

Input Specification

The Input specification statement provides characteristics of
input records and defines the individual data fields associated
with each input record.  A great deal of program logic may be
specified with the input specification, such as control fields,
matching multiple inputs on a common field (such as account
number), automatically using a key value in one file to read the
corresponding record in a secondary file, and setting indicators
depending upon the presence of data in specified fields.

Using the input specification is done a bit differently from the
file specification.  One or more specification statements are
used to first define characteristics of the record in order to
allow the program to identify the record uniquely.  Following
these specification statements are one or more statements which
define the data fields which are to be processed from the input
record.

To clearly differentiate these functions, I have divided the
fields of the input specification into two groups.  These fields
define record characteristics and provide the means to uniquely
identify each discrete record type:

 Column(s)   Field Name        Use
7 - 14      File Name         name of file used internally and in
                              JCL (DD name)

                              record identifiers or for
                              specifying alternate indicators to
                              be turned on for identical record
                              formats
15 - 16     Sequence          used to specify sequence checking
                              on record groups - enter number,
                              beginning with 01, for each record
                              type - enter any 2 alphabetic
                              characters for unsequenced input
                              record groups
17          Number            used in conjunction with sequence,
                              enter 1 to indicate only one
                              instance of a specific record type
                              should occur in a group; enter N to
                              indicate one or more instances may
                              be present
18          Option            used in conjunction with sequence,
                              enter O if a specific record need
                              not be present in a group; leave
                              blank if an instance is required to
                              be present
19 - 20     Record Indicator  enter the indicator (01 - 99) to be
                              set on when this record is read

                              EBCDIC character; if comparison
                              type is Z, enter & or A-I to check
                              for 12-zone, enter - or J-R to
                              check for 11-zone, S-Z to check for
                              0-zone, blank or 0-9 to check for
                              the absence of zones

These fields define individual data fields in the input records,
along with identifying control level, matching, and other special
characteristics of data fields:

 Column(s)   Field Name        Use
43          Packed            enter P if field is in packed
                              decimal format

                              within a group of records
65 - 66     Positive          for numeric fields, enter indicator
                              to turn on if the field contains a
                              positive value when read
67 - 68     Negative          for numeric fields, enter indicator
                              to turn on if the field contains a
                              negative value when read
69 - 70     Zero or Blank     for numeric fields, enter indicator
                              to turn on if the field contains
                              zero when read; for alphabetic
                              fields, enter indicator to turn on
                              if the field contains blanks when
                              read

Output Specification

The Output specification statement provides characteristics of
output records and defines the individual data fields or
constants to be written for a particular output (or updated)
record.

Like the input specification, the output specification is used to
provide two separate, but related, types of information.  First,
one or more specification statements are used to define the
conditions under which an output record is produced.  Following
these specification statements are one or more statements which
define the data fields or literals to be written to the output
record.

To clearly differentiate these functions, I have divided the
fields of the output specification into two groups.  These fields
define when an output record is written:

 Column(s)   Field Name        Use
7 - 14      File name         name of file used internally and in
                              JCL (DD name)
14 - 16     AND/OR            used when specifying more than 3
                              record indicators
15          H = heading       specifies the time in the RPG logic
            D = detail        cycle when this output is to occur
            T = total         - note that for all practical
                              purposes, Heading and Detail time
                              are the same
16 - 18     ADD               to add records to an ISAM file
17          Space Before      enter 0-3 to specify number of
                              lines to space before printing
18          Space After       enter 0-3 to specify number of
                              lines to space after printing
19 - 20     Skip Before       enter 01-12 to specify channel to
                              skip to before printing
21 - 22     Skip After        enter 01-12 to specify channel to
                              skip to after printing
23          Negates           enter N to specify that the
26          indicator         associated indicator must not be on
29                            as a condition of this output
                              operation
24 - 25     Indicator         enter the indicator to be used to
27 - 28                       condition this output operation
30 - 31

These fields define individual data fields or literal values to
be placed in the output record:

 Column(s)   Field Name        Use
32 - 37     Field Name        enter field to be written to output
38          Edit Code         enter edit code or leave blank to
                              use edit constant word
39          Blank After       reset source data field contents to
                              blank or zero after field is moved
                              to the output record
40 - 43     End Position      enter position in output record to
                              contain right-most character of
                              output field
44          Packed            enter P if output is to be written
                              in packed decimal format
45 - 70     Constant or       enter literal constant or edit word
            Edit Word         enclosed in apostrophes
