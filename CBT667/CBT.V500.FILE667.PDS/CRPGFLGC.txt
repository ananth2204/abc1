    RPG Tutorial: The RPG Logic Cycle


RPG is a non-procedural language.  The events that happen in any
particular RPG programs occur in exactly the same order as in every
other RPG program.  This order is known as the RPG Logic Cycle.  What
makes one RPG program different from another is that "indicators" or
switches are turned on or off, based upon tests performed on the data
being processed, which cause or prevent input, calculation, or output
events at specific points in the cycle.

I have seen several flow charts of the RPG Logic Cycle, but the most
useful to me has been the one that is on the RPG Debugging template I
acquired in 1973.  Using VISIO, I have recreated it below and you may
download a printable copy of it in an Adobe PDF using this
link: rpglogic.tar.gz <../download/zips/rpglogic.tar.gz>.  (The archive
may be uncompressed using tar on Linux platforms and WinZip or ZipNAll
on Windows/?? platforms.)

Simple RPG programs may be written with only the understanding that the
order of processing is Input followed by Calculations followed by
Output.  But the more complex an RPG program is, the more important it
will be for the programmer to thoroughly understand the RPG Logic Cycle.

You may view the logic flow chart, which is in Adobe PDF format,
by downloading member CRPGFLOW in BINARY to a PC, and using the
Adobe reader.  You can also print it out from the PC, using the
Adobe reader.
