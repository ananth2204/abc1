//***FILE 667 is from Jay Moseley and contains a tutorial about     *   FILE 667
//*           how to use the RPG/F compiler which is on File 327.   *   FILE 667
//*           This tutorial is especially complete and valuable,    *   FILE 667
//*           since it is difficult to find RPG/F manuals from      *   FILE 667
//*           IBM which date back to the 1960s and 1970s.  With     *   FILE 667
//*           this tutorial, you should be able to use the free     *   FILE 667
//*           RPG/F compiler and library from File 327 profitably   *   FILE 667
//*           and productively.                                     *   FILE 667
