    RPG Tutorial: RPG Indicators


This page outlines the conditions under which various RPG
indicators are set on or off and the times during the execution
of each iteration of the RPG object module at which the
indicators are set.

The condition of any indicator may be governed by SETON and SETOF
operations included among the calculation specifications.  The RPG
object module will turn indicators on only if the conditions
specified in the RPG specifications are met, that is, last record
(LR), matching record (MR), and overflow (OV or OA, OB, ... OG).
In addition, certain conditions may arise that will cause the RPG
object module to set on the halt indicator HO.  These conditions
are listed below.  Unless the HO indicator is turned off by a SETOF
operation (entered in the calculation specifications), the object
module will terminate before the next input record is read.  The
RPG object module will turn on indicator HO whenever the program:

    * Reads an input record that was not defined on the input
      specifications sheet (columns 21-41).
    * Finds an input record out of the predetermined sequence of
      card types specified by the entry in Sequence (columns
      15-16) on the input specifications sheet.
    * Finds an input record out of sequence when the entry in
      Matching Fields (columns 61-62) on the input specifications
      sheet was used for sequence checking a single input file.
    * Encounters a chaining field in the chaining file that does
      not appear in the chained file during random processing of
      multiple input files.
    * Does not find the record key that designates the lower limit
      (obtained from the Record Address File) during sequential
      processing between limits of an indexed-sequential file.
    * Finds a wrong length record during processing of an
      indexed-sequential file.
    * Finds an invalid length record (zero or too long) during
      random processing by record identification of a file
      residing on a disk device.
    * Finds a difference between the key length of a record in an
      indexed-sequential file and the length as specified in
      Length of Record Address Field (columns 29-30) on the file
      description specifications sheet during processing with
      Record Address File support (random or between limits).
    * Finds a difference between the key length in the chained
      indexed-sequential file and the length as specified
      (columns 44-51) on the input specifications sheet during
      chaining of multiple input files.
    * Encounters a disk device error during sequential or random
      processing of an indexed-sequential file.
    * Does not find keys in a directly organized file when the
      entry in Record Address Type (column 31) on the file
      description specifications sheet specified processing by
      key.
    * Does not find a record with the specified key during random
      processing of an indexed-sequential file.
    * Encounters an irrecoverable input-output error during
      processing of a sequential file.
