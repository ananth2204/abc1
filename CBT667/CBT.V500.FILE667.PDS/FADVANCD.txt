    RPG Tutorial:
    Advanced statement types (Extension/Line Counter)


The Extension and Line Counter specifications are both used to
supply additional information about specific types of files to be
processed by the RPG program.

It is rare to have a printer file that will not require a Line
Counter specification, but the specification is uncomplicated and
will, for the most part, be the same for all programs.

The Extension specification is used for defining tables and
establishing relationships to indexed-sequential files that are to
be read "automatically" using chaining fields or Record Address
Files.  Therefore, the need to code Extension specifications will
occur less frequently.

If used, Extension and Line Counter specifications follow the
File Description specifications in the source program.

      Line Counter specification

When writing an output file to a physical printer, the printer
relies upon carriage control tape punches (or the equivalent
carriage control buffer) to control skipping and page overflow
operations.  When such a file is first written to an intermediary
storage device, such as happens under MVT spooling, the RPG program
must count the number of output lines written and simulate the
presence of a carriage control tape/buffer.

This functionality is provided with the Line Counter specification.
In a physical carriage control tape, a channel 12 punch is used to
signal that the end of the physical page has been reached.  A
channel 01 punch is used to advance the carriage to the top of the
next physical page.  Punches in other channels are optionally used
to specify stopping at intermediate points on the physical page.
Entries on the Line Counter specifications are used to provide the
functional equivalent of the carriage control tape punches (or
forms control buffer).

      File Extension specification

RPG programs which utilize Record Address Files, chained
indexed-sequential files, and table files require that information
specific to these files be specified in addition to the standard
information contained on the File Description specification.  The
File Extension specification is used to provide that information.
Because this specification is used to specify such a variety of
dissimilar information, it can be confusing.  I have divided the
information into three groups - the first for chained files, the
second for record address files, and the third for tables.


        Entries for chained files

Column(s)  Field Name      Use
--------   ----------      ---
7 - 8      Record          enter the sequence entry (from column
           Sequence of     15-16 of the input specification) for
           chaining file   the input file which is the 'chained
                           from' file
9 - 10     Number of the   enter the number (C1 - C9) identifying
           chaining        the field used to link the chaining
           field           record with the chained record (from
                           column 61-62 of the input
                           specification)
11 - 18    From Filename   enter the name of the chaining file
19 - 26    To Filename     enter the name of the chained file


        Entries for Record Address Files

Column(s)  Field Name      Use
--------   ----------      ---
11 - 18    From Filename   enter the name of the record address
                           file
19 - 26    To Filename     enter the name of the
                           Indexed-Sequential file that contains
                           the data records to be processed


        Entries for tables

Column(s)  Field Name      Use
--------   ----------      ---
11 - 18    From Filename   enter the name of the file from which
                           the table entries will be read

                           the updated table will be written
27 - 32    Table Name      enter the name of the table (the first
                           three positions must be "TAB")
33 - 35    Entries         enter the number of table elements
           per Record      read from/written to each physical
                           record (used only when table is read
                           from or written to a file)
36 - 39    Entries per     enter the number of elements to be
           Table           contained in the table

                           ascending sequence;
                           enter "D" if in descending sequence;
                           leave blank if unsequenced - in tables

                           the order in which the arguments
