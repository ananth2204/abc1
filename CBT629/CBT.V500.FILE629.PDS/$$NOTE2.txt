Hi Sam,

Here is a small update to file629 (an SNTP server).

A user has requested that some way of adjusting the TOD clock
values to match UCT (GMT) time be provided.  This is for sites
that run with their TOD clock set to local time instead of GMT.

Now you can issue a modify command to set the adjustment on the
fly as follows:

F sntpproc,TOD +hhmm
or
F sntpproc,TOD -hhmm

Cheers,
Andrew.
