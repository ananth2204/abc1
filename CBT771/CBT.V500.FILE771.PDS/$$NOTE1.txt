Hello Sam,

I have downloaded diverse goodies from CBT-Org, and now I will
give you an ICSF - Status - Monitor that you may share with the
other folks.  The monitor is written in REXX and is called as a
TSO command.

Here is the main display after calling the REXX:

    ---  sample screen was here  ---

It shows much information from ICSF control blocks and displays
the crypto services formatted with CSFDACC as used for RMF
reporting.

For a better feeling how many crypto actions are called you can
sample statistics for a given time range.

    ---  sample screen was here  ---

In the sample before I count the services for 10 secs. The result
shows like this:

    ---  sample screen was here  ---

If you like it and you think that it's of interest for the other
folks please give me an answer and I will send you the REXX.

Kind regards from Germany, Karl-Heinz Doppelfeld.
