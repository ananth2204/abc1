THE PERMANENT CHANGE\n         IS TO THE NAME OF THE SUBSYSTEM IN THE LIFE-OF-JOB\n         SSIB FOR THE REQUESTING STC OR TSU.  THE TEMPORARY\n         CHANGES ARE TO THE MASTER SCHEDULER'S INTERNAL READER\n         JFCB AND DSAB.\n\n         THE PROTOCOL THAT THIS MODIFICATION USES TO DETECT A\n         REQUEST FOR A SECONDARY SUBSYSTEM IS \"==XXXX==\" IN\n         COLUMNS 73-80 OF THE STC OR TSU JOB STATEMENT.\n         \"XXXX\" IS THE NAME OF THE REQUESTED SUBSYSTEM.  NO\n         CHECK IS MADE TO SEE THAT IT IS A VALID AND ACTIVE\n         SUBSYSTEM.\n\n         FOR STARTED TASKS, THIS MODIFICATION WILL DETECT THE\n         SPECIFICATION OF A SPECIAL KEYWORD PARAMETER (\"SUB=XXXX\")\n         ON THE JCL OF THE STARTED TASK.  THIS PARAMETER MUST BE\n         ENTERED BY THE OPERATOR, AS ONLY THE JCL CREATED BY\n         STARTED TASK CONTROL, AND NOT THE SPECIFIED PROCEDURE,\n         IS SCANNED FOR THE KEYWORD.  THIS PARAMETER DOES NOT\n         HAVE BE DEFINED IN THE PROCEDURE AND MUST NOT BE USED\n         IN THE PROCEDURE, AS IT IS REMOVED FROM THE GENERATED JCL.\n         THE VALUE FOLLOWING THE KEYWORD IS MOVED, ALONG WITH THE\n         EQUAL SIGNS, TO COLUMNS 73-80 OF THE FIRST STARTED TASK\n         JCL STATEMENT.\n\n         IT IS THE INSTALLATION'S RESPONSIBILITY TO PLACE THE\n         \"==XXXX==\" IN 73-80 OF THE FIRST JCL STATEMENT OF THE\n         TSU JCL.  THE \"SUB=\" KEYWORD PARAMETER IS NOT SCANNED FOR,\n         AS ANOTHER MODIFICATION IS NECESSARY TO PLACE THE\n         SUBSYSTEM NAME IN THE GENERATED TSU JCL AND THIS\n         MODIFICATION CAN PLACE IT IN COLUMNS 73-80 OF THE FIRST\n         JCL STATEMENT ITSELF.  ALSO, BY NOT MAKING IT A KEYWORD\n         PARAMETER, A USER'S LOGON JCL IS NOT RESTRICTED FROM\n         USING IT AS A VALID SYMBOLIC PARAMETER.  THE EASIEST\n         WAY TO PLACE THIS PARAMETER ON THE TIME SHARING USER'S\n         JCL IS TO GENERATE THE LOGON JCL IN THE LOGON PRE-PROMPT\n         EXIT (IKJEFLD).\n\n         THESE MODIFICATIONS ARE INSERTED AT THE POINT THAT IEFJSWT\n         ENQUEUES ON EITHER STCQUE OR TSOQUE.  THIS PROVIDES\n         PROPER SERIALIZATION OF THE CONTROL BLOCK CHANGES\n         BEING MADE.  HOWEVER, THIS SERIALIZATION IS SYSTEM-WIDE.\n         THIS MEANS THAT IF, FOR ANY REASON, IEFJSWT CANNOT\n         FINISH SUBMITTING THE STC OR TSU ON THE INTERNAL READER,\n         NO OTHER STC OR TSU JOBS MAY BE STARTED ON ANY SUBSYSTEM\n         (EITHER PRIMARY OR SECONDARY).  THE PERFECT EXAMPLE OF\n         THIS IS THAT A TSU BEING LOGGED ONTO A SECONDARY JES\n         ENCOUNTERS A JOB QUEUE FULL CONDITION.  SINCE THE ENQUEUE\n         ON TSOQUE IS HELD BY THE SUBMITTING ADDRESS SPACE,\n         NO TSU'S CAN LOG ONTO THE PRIMARY JES.  NOTE THAT\n         TSU'S AND STC'S HAVE SEPARATE ENQUEUE NAMES AND HANGING\n         ONE UP WILL NOT HANG THE OTHER (UNLESS IT ENCOUNTERS\n         THE SAME CONDITION THAT HUNG THE OTHER).\n\n         LOGIC OF THESE MODIFICATIONS\n\n         AT THE POINT WHERE STARTED TASK OR MOUNT COMMAND PROCESSING\n         BRANCHES TO ENQUEUE ON THE STCQUE, A BRANCH IS MADE TO THE\n         PATCH AREA.  EACH JCL STATEMENT EXCEPT THE FIRST (WHICH\n         IS ASSUMED TO BE THE JOB STATEMENT) IS SCANNED FOR \",SUB=\".\n         IF NOT FOUND ON ANY JCL STATEMENT, PROCESSING RESUMES AT\n         THE ENQUEUE.  IF FOUND, COLUMNS 73-80 OF THE FIRST JCL\n         STATEMENT ARE SET TO \"==    ==\" AND COLUMNS 73-80 OF THE\n         STATEMENT THAT \",SUB=\" WAS FOUND ON ARE BLANKED. THE\n         DATA FOLLOWING THE KEYWORD IS ASSUMED TO BE A SUBSYSTEM\n         NAME AND IS MOVED ONE CHARACTER AT A TIME TO COLUMNS 75-78\n         OF THE FIRST JCL STATEMENT.  WHEN EITHER A BLANK OR A COMMA\n         IS ENCOUNTERED OR 4 CHARACTERS HAVE BEEN MOVED, THE\n         REMAINDER OF THE JCL STATEMENT IS SHIFTED OVER THE\n         \",SUB=XXXX\", EFFECTIVELY DELETING IT. NOTE THAT THE\n         KEYWORD PARAMETER WILL NOT BE FOUND IF IT IS THE FIRST\n         PARAMETER ON A JCL CONTINUATION STATEMENT, SINCE A\n         LEADING COMMA IS ASSUMED.  HENCE, IT BEHOOVES THE USER\n         TO ENTER THE PARAMETER BEFORE OTHER PARAMETERS ON THE\n         START COMMAND.  ALSO NOTE THAT NO VALIDITY CHECK IS DONE\n         ON THE \"SUBSYSTEM NAME\" AND IT IS TRUNCATED AT 4 CHARACTERS,\n         WHICH WILL PROBABLY CAUSE A JCL ERROR IF IT IS ACTUALLY\n         LONGER.\n\n         IMMEDIATELY AFTER THE ENQUEUE ON STCQUE OR TSOQUE\n         (IN FACT THE ENQUEUE IS OVERLAID AND MOVED TO THE\n         PATCH AREA), THE TIOT IS SCANNED FOR THE DDNAME BEING\n         USED (STCINRDR OR TSOINRDR IN THE ACB).  IF NOT FOUND,\n         WE GIVE UP AND RETURN TO NORMAL PROCESSING (THIS SHOULD\n         NEVER HAPPEN).  THE DSAB CHAIN IS THEN SEARCHED FOR A\n         MATCHING TIOT ADDRESS.  IF NOT FOUND, WE GIVE UP HERE\n         (THIS IS ALSO A \"SHOULD NEVER HAPPEN\").  THE JFCB ADDRESS\n         IN THE TIOT ENTRY IS LOADED.  IF ZERO,  WE GIVE UP AGAIN.\n         THE JESCT IS LOCATED AND IS USED TO \"REFRESH\" THE JFCB\n         DATA SET NAME AND THE DSAB SUBSYSTEM NAME (DSABSSNM)\n         BACK TO THE NAME OF THE PRIMARY JES.  THIS IS BECAUSE\n         THEY MAY HAVE BEEN CHANGED THE LAST TIME THEY WERE USED\n         AND THIS MODIFICATION DOES NOT CHANGE THEM BACK AFTER USE.\n\n         COLUMNS 73-74 AND 79-80 ARE CHECKED FOR \"==\".  IF NOT\n         THERE, THIS IS A \"NORMAL\" STC OR TSU AND WE RESUME WHERE\n         WE LEFT OFF.  IF THIS IS A SECONDARY SUBSYSTEM REQUEST,\n         THE LIFE-OF-JOB SSIB, THE JFCB DATA SET NAME, AND THE\n         DSAB SUBSYSTEM NAME ARE CHANGED TO WHATEVER IS IN\n         COLUMNS 75-78 OF THE JOB STATEMENT.\n\n         NO VALIDITY CHECK WHATSOEVER IS DONE ON THE SUBSYSTEM NAME.\n         IF IT IS NOT A VALID SUBSYSTEM, THE STARTED TASK OR TSO\n         USER WILL DISAPPEAR AND NO INDICATION OF AN ERROR WILL\n         BE GIVEN.  FOR TSO, THE LOGON PRE-PROMPT EXIT (OR WHATEVER\n         SET THE SUBSYSTEM NAME) SHOULD VALIDITY CHECK THE SPECIFIED\n         SUBSYSTEM TO INSURE THAT IT IS AN ACTIVE SUBSYSTEM THAT\n         SUPPORTS THE JOB SELECT FUNCTION.

IBM HAS ALREADY PROVIDED THE ABILITY\n         TO DIRECT STARTED TASKS TO A SECONDARY SUBSYSTEM.\n\n         IN ORDER TO LOG ONTO A SECONDARY JES, THREE THINGS\n         MUST BE MODIFIED ON BEHALF OF THE TSU, ONE PERMANENTY\n         AND TWO TEMPORARILY.  THE PERMANENT CHANGE IS TO THE\n         NAME OF THE SUBSYSTEM IN THE LIFE-OF-JOB SSIB FOR THE\n         REQUESTING TIME SHARING USER.  THE TEMPORARY CHANGES\n         ARE TO THE MASTER SCHEDULER'S INTERNAL READER JFCB AND\n         DSAB AND ARE ALREADY MODIFIED BY THIS MODULE AS\n         SUPPLIED BY IBM.\n\n         THE PROTOCOL THAT THIS MODIFICATION USES TO DETECT A\n         REQUEST FOR A SECONDARY SUBSYSTEM IS \"==XXXX==\" IN\n         COLUMNS 73-80 OF THE TSU JOB STATEMENT.\n         \"XXXX\" IS THE NAME OF THE REQUESTED SUBSYSTEM.  NO\n         CHECK IS MADE TO SEE THAT IT IS A VALID AND ACTIVE\n         SUBSYSTEM.\n\n         IT IS THE INSTALLATION'S RESPONSIBILITY TO PLACE THE\n         \"==XXXX==\" IN 73-80 OF THE FIRST JCL STATEMENT OF THE\n         TSU JCL.  THE EASIEST WAY TO PLACE THIS PARAMETER ON\n         THE JOB STATEMENT OF THE TIME SHARING USER'S JCL IS\n         TO GENERATE THE LOGON JCL IN THE LOGON PRE-PROMPT\n         EXIT (IKJEFLD).\n\n         THE CHANGES TO THE JFCB AND DSAB ARE MADE AFTER IEFJSWT\n         ENQUEUES ON EITHER STCQUE OR TSOQUE.  THIS PROVIDES\n         PROPER SERIALIZATION OF THE CONTROL BLOCK CHANGES\n         BEING MADE.  HOWEVER, THIS SERIALIZATION IS SYSTEM-WIDE.\n         THIS MEANS THAT IF, FOR ANY REASON, IEFJSWT CANNOT\n         FINISH SUBMITTING THE STC OR TSU ON THE INTERNAL READER,\n         NO OTHER STC OR TSU JOBS MAY BE STARTED ON ANY SUBSYSTEM\n         (EITHER PRIMARY OR SECONDARY).  THE PERFECT EXAMPLE OF\n         THIS IS THAT A TSU BEING LOGGED ONTO A SECONDARY JES\n         ENCOUNTERS A JOB QUEUE FULL CONDITION.  SINCE THE ENQUEUE\n         ON TSOQUE IS HELD BY THE SUBMITTING ADDRESS SPACE,\n         NO TSU'S CAN LOG ONTO THE PRIMARY JES.  NOTE THAT\n         TSU'S AND STC'S HAVE SEPARATE ENQUEUE NAMES AND HANGING\n         ONE UP WILL NOT HANG THE OTHER (UNLESS IT ENCOUNTERS\n         THE SAME CONDITION THAT HUNG THE OTHER).\n\n         LOGIC OF THIS MODIFICATION\n\n         AT THE POINT WHERE THE TSU ENQUEUE PARAMETER LIST HAS BEEN\n         BUILD, INSTEAD OF BRANCHING TO THE ENQUEUE, A BRANCH TO\n         THE PATCH AREA IS MADE.
