Attached is a product which I would like to submit for CBT tape
inclusion.

It contains the following members:

    * XAML01 - A REXX script that produces a bar chart in a
      Silverlight (http://silverlight.net/) XAML file format.
      Silverlight is Microsoft's answer to Adobe's Flash.

    * DOCPDF - "How To" documentation in PDF format. I've also
      attached this directly to this email so you can get a quick
      view as to what this REXX script can produce.

    * DOCWORD - "How To" documentation in MS-Word format.

    * HTML - A sample HTML page that will display a XAML file
      using Silverlight.  Your internet browser must have had the
      Silverlight plug-in installed before the bar chart can be
      displayed.

    * JCL1 - A sample batch job that executes the XAML01 script.

    * JCL2 - A sample batch job that executes the XAML01 script.
