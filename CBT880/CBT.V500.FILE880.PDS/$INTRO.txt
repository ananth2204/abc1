        Introduction

        The MVSDSSN is an extension of the standard ADRDSSU
        utility, to manage the dumps in the network.  We have
        here (ISIS Information System) two very old tape units,
        but "nearly" unlimited storage capacity on the local
        network. We extended the ADRDSSU utility via UIM (User
        Interaction Module) exits to write dumps to HFS
        (Hierarchical File System) files, and store the dump
        information in a DB2 database. This modification is
        running here for several years, maybe smaller shops can
        use this. A large part of the modification was written
        in C/C++, we provide the complete source code, and the
        necessary definitions for DB2. The code uses the open
        source "zlib" general purpose compress library,
