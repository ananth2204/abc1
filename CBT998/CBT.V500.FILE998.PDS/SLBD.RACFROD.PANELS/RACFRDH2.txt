              | RACF Reports On-Demand Using IBM DFSort ICETool |
              ---------------------------------------------------
+
  By default, RACFROD generates a%single, one-step, batch job+consisting of
% many separate reports+each of which is directed to a%uniquely allocated
  output DDNAME. +This characteristic of RACFROD is implemented consistently
  even if multiple report selections are made randomly.  The output of
  DFSort and ICETool processing can be viewed by using the%SDSF "?"+line
  command and examining the%DFSMSG+and%TOOLMSG+DDNAMEs, respectively.

+ Individual jobs are not generated when multiple report selections are made.
  Both%short and long messages are displayed+if errors are made at report
  selection, during ISPF file tailoring, and when job submission is undertaken.

+ RACFROD automatically directs the user to a fully tailored job stream as
  displayed by the ISPF editor. The user is free to capture and tailor the
  generated job stream using the ISPF Edit CUT and PASTE top line commands and
  save the JCL to a personal data set.
