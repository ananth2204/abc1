              ---------------------------------------------------
+
% RACF Reports On-Demand+(RACFROD) is an ISPF-based REXX application that uses
  file tailoring to process a list of%generic reports+and generate a batch
  job to format those reports or a subset thereof.  The tailored JCL
  invokes%IBM DFSort ICETool+to format the reports using data derived from
  the%RACF IRRDBU00 unload utility. +This data set name is required.

% To use RACFROD:%(1)+simply press the%Enter key+to generate all reports,%(2)
  select any combination+of individual reports by typing an "S" in the
  S input field to generate the JCL for an individual report as described by
  text to the right of the Rec/Typ field.

  The user will be presented with a fully-customized job as displayed by the
  ISPF editor. If the%Submit on F3+is%Y+then the job will be submitted when
  Edit ends. If%N+then the user must issue the%Submit+command manually.  Use
 %CANCEL+to exit the editor and bypass JCL submission.  The job output can be
  viewed easily from SDSF, (E)JES, or other spool display product.
