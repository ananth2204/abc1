The members in this library are:
$README  : A short README file.
NAWK     : The actual executable, must be copied to a z/OS UNIX directory!
NAWK1CAT : The UNIX "man" page, formatted for use.
PAXFULL  : The pax archive containing all the files, source and support.
PAXLIST  : A list of the files in archive in PAXFULL.
UNPAX    : Example JCL to unwind PAXFULL into a z/OS UNIX directory.

You don't need to unwind the PAXFULL member if you only want to install
the executable.  You can simply do the UNIX command:
   cp -B "//'this.library(NAWK)'" /directory/containing/bin/nawk
