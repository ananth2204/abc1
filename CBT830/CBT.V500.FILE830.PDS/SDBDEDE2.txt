Refreshing RACF profiles - an update

Since the publication of my article A TSO command to refresh
RACF profiles in the July 1991 issue of MVS Update, the IBM
RACF design team has contacted me to explain some possible
problems with the program. It seems that I used control blocks
that are intended for IBM diagnostic purposes only, and as
such these control blocks are liable to change without customer
notification. After further conversations with IBMers and
following their suggestions, I have rewritten the program and
now use intended RACF interfaces.

The new version of the program is a lot safer than before.
RACF keeps the four most recently used sets of generic
profiles in storage in the user's address space. So, if the
program issues four RACROUTE REQUEST=AUTH requests,
each for a non-existent dataset and each with a different high-
level qualifier, RACF will flush out all the previous sets of
generic profiles. This will force RACF to extract any
subsequent profile from the database and the effect of
refreshing the profiles will have been achieved.

There is a small overhead in I/O to the RACF database, but it
should not be too much if the high-level qualifiers are selected
to be similar to each other. This overhead is reduced by
choosing 'SYS0DUM*' since all the index blocks required to
find names that start with 'SYS1' are probably in storage and a
name beginning with 'SYS0' would probably fall into the same
blocks. APF-authorization is still needed to suppress any
failure and audit records produced by the program.

Many thanks to Walt Farrell from the IBM RACF design team
in the USA for his help.
