Determining ASID type in SMF exits

SMF exits are used for a wide variety of processing and control
functions by MVS sites.  Often processing that is appropriate to
a batch job is not appropriate to a TSO user or to a started task
(such as account code checking).  There is no documented
method of determining what sort of address space is running
the exit.  It could be a batch job, started task, or TSO user.
However, one of the parameters in the common exit parameter
list (CEPA) points to the Job Management Record (JMR).

The JMR has a job class field which, for a batch job, is exactly
that.  But for a TSO user this field is set to X'E0' and for a
started task it is set to X'D0'.  Therefore, it is possible to
detect the ASID type by checking this field.

Use the IEFJMR macro to map the JMR as follows:

         L     R3,0(R1)           JMR ADDR IN CEPA
         USING JMR,R3             ADDR JMR
         CLI   JMRCLASS,X'D0'     IS IT A STC
         BE    STC                YES
         CLI   JMRCLASS,X'E0'     IS IT A TSU
         BE    TSO                YES
         B     BATCH              MUST BE BATCH JOB
         .
