Swapping out a job waiting for a mount request

How do you swap out a batch job waiting for a mount request,
which is occupying an address space and consuming resources?
As our system is generally well loaded between 8.00 am and
5.00 pm, one domain has been reserved for production batch
jobs.  This domain has been defined with CNSTR equal to
(1,2), which means a maximum of two jobs can run together
within this domain.  Since our database has a time limit of 90
seconds between two commands, if a batch job working with
this database is swapped out for more than 90 seconds, it will
abend when it becomes swapped in.

When a job is waiting for a mount request, it becomes non-
swappable in its domain and another job is swapped out, with
the consequences described above.

To avoid this problem, the parameter JWT is set to 1 (so there
is a one minute wait before calling IEFUTL) and the exit
IEFUTL is modified as shown in the following listing.  The
exit IEFUTL must be in the LPALIB concatenation and must
be in an authorized state.  For started tasks, the parameter
TIME=1440 must be used in the EXEC statement (in this case,
time out and wait time hasn't any effect on this address space).

The SMF exit IEFUTL has the following defaults and actions:

                              Defaults                              Actions

TSO CPU time      1.30 minutes (JES2 parm)      30 second extension
Wait time      1 minute (SMFPARM/JWT)      24 minute extension

                                                                       before ab
Wait time      1 minute (SMFPARM/JWT)      job is swapped out
