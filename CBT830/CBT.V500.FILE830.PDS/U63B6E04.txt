Issuing console commands from TSO and JCL

CONSOLE COMMANDS FROM TSO CLISTS

To be able to issue any console command from TSO can be very helpful
when designing end-user ISPF dialogs with hidden console commands and
making automatic system maintenance from TSO in batch.  The command is
issued under master console authority.

The program named COMMAND is as follows:

*      TSO COMMAND
*      ISSUES INTERNAL OS/JES COMMAND FROM TSO:  THE COMMAND IS
*            FX:  COMMAND V 3A9,ONLINE
         CVT   DSECT=YES

EXIT     EQU   *
         EXITR                          RETURN
         LTORG
         END

The format of the command is:

COMMAND console-command
example: COMMAND V SYSLOG,HARDCPY,CMDS,ROUT=ALL

The program COMMAND will show the command to the issuer via a TPUT.
Another program exists called COMMANDN which is identical to COMMAND
execept that it lacks the TPUT in order to hide the command function for
the user in a CLIST.

CONSOLE COMMANDS FROM JCL

This facility gives users the ability to intersperse console commands
within their JCL.  The console command is fetched from the PARM field of
an EXEC card for the following program.  This technique also allows
commands to be issued dependent upon condition codes:

*   THIS PROGRAM ISSUES AN OPERATOR COMMAND FROM THE PARAMETER FIELD
*     EXECUTED VIA JCL OR CALL COMMAND FROM TSO
         CVT   DSECT=YES
