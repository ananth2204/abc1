A user's view of the NAS 7900

INTRODUCTION

This article describes the experience at a medium-sized site in
installing and running a NAS 7900 semiconductor disk in a production
environment over a period of four months, continuous use.

The article centres on the practical aspects of using a device of this
type and ends with a brief discussion of the wider issues of purchasing
and running it.  The description of the purely technical features of the
hardware is brief, as full information on these matters is easily
obtainable from the supplier.

SUMMARY

The NAS 7900 solid state disk is a storage device with response times of 0 to 8
msec as measured by RMF.  Its main purpose is to provide fast response times
(relative to conventional electro-mechanical devices) on critical datasets.
Our short-term requirements of the device were two-fold:

*    To serve as the main paging device for time-critical on-line
applications.

*    To help forestall an incipient virtual storage constraint by
enabling us to make memory-resident buffer areas disk-resident.

These objectives were achieved in the main, although under MVS the
device has features that are not altogether satisfactory.  One of these,
which is MVS dependent, might conceivably be improved upon in a future
release of the operating system.  The other is a hardware dependency,
for which relief has already been promised by the manufacturer.

7900 HARDWARE OVERVIEW

Main characteristics

The features of most interest to the user are:

*    Measured response time: 0 to 8 msec
*    Disk sizes: 4, 8, 16, or 32MB
*    Access mode: equivalent performance for read and write
*    Devices emulated: 3380, 3350, 3330-11
*    Internal back-up: on built-in Winchester disk
*    Power supply: optional battery for emergency back-up
*    Moving parts: in back-up disk only
*    Hardware configuration: Figure 1 is a schematic representation of
the minimum configuration.  Some details have been omitted for the sake
of clarity.

Comments

*    7970 disk controller.  The two directors are independent and their
external features are similar to those of a 3880 (or NAS 7880)
controller.

*    Winchester disk.  This is a back-up device to which the contents of
the solid state working device are written at power-off, or when a power
failure is sensed by the device.  At power-on the solid state device is
re-loaded from the disk by default.

*    Battery.  The main purpose of this optional attachment is to
provide a period of continued operation in the event of a back-up disk
malfunction.  The solid state device can then be backed up on tape or
conventional disk before shutting the 7900 down for repairs (we did not
install one).

SITE CHARACTERISTICS

Ours is a two-mainframe site serving a medium-sized SNA network.  The
most important on-line applications execute in two CICS regions.  They
are used extensively throughout the network.  Another application of
growing importance is an Information Centre presently implemented on
FOCUS/TSO.  Details of the configuration are summarised in Figure 2.

Notes

*    7380s are NAS plug-compatible 3380s.
*    IDMS is our central database system.
*    ADS is an on-line program development environment executing under
     IDMS.
*    TSO/FOCUS is used to support the Information Centre.
*    MSX is a poor man's CTCA.  It performs a subset of GRS function and
     is implemented in software, the two mainframes communicating by
     means of a dataset.  This is very heavily utilised and was placed
     on a 7900 in an experiment described below.

PROBLEM AREAS

Excessive paging

The production system was experiencing demand paging rates of about
65-70 pages per second, caused by a shortage of real storage.  While
this is not considered excessive for MVS it impacted the CICS and IDMS
response times.  These are both single-task applications, which makes
them sensitive to paging, even at low rates.

Virtual storage

An incipient constraint was beginning to make itself felt in the IDMS
region.  This was executing at the time in a nominal region of 6.8MB
while actually requiring about 7.5MB.  It was obvious that a further
expansion of network size or IDMS-based on-line applications would in
time cause a permanent constraint condition.  This could lead to a
freeze on expansion, service interruptions, and ultimately a hasty
conversion to XA, all of which were considered unacceptable.

SOLUTIONS

The obvious solution to a real storage shortage is to add more real
storage - under the circumstances described above an addition of 8MB
would reduce the paging rate by about 50%, which would have been ample
for our needs.  This however was not immediately practicable: the
required memory expansion was not available as soon as we wished and
even had it been the constraint condition would remain unresolved.  It
was also felt that a device like the 7900 would be at our disposal and
operational even after the installation of a new CPU, while the memory
expansion would be a loss apart from a marginal increase in the resale
value of the old machine.

These considerations led to the installation of a 7900 with a capacity
of 64MB.

The initial configuration was to be as follows:

*    48MB (six '3380s' of 8MB) - for local page dataset on the
     production system.
*    16MB (two '3380s') - for IDMS production buffer areas.
*    This left room for the placement of a number of small, heavily-used
     datasets, which we could experiment with.

INSTALLATION AND OPERATION

Installation

From a system programmer's point of view this is no different from that
of a regular disk device - the macros used in IOGEN and IOCP are
identical.  There is a minor difference during initialisation.  As the
system 'sees' a regular device the initialisation must include the
allocation of a dummy dataset, which corresponds in size to the
non-existent space on the physical device.  This is quite
straightforward and is adequately described in the manual.
Alternatively, the initialisation can be done stand-alone by
initialising the disk as a VM mini-disk using the MIMIC option.

The disk sizes (4, 8, 16, or 32MB) and emulation mode (3380, 3350, or
3330) are defined in the hardware at installation time, or when a change
is needed.

Operation

The device was put in production as outlined above and has remained
practically unchanged since.  A summary of performance characteristics
as experienced by us is shown below in Figure 3.

PERFORMANCE BENEFITS

As stated in the summary our objectives were in the main achieved:
*    CICS response time: 1.4 secs on the average, down from 2.3 before
installation.  This amounts to a 40% improvement (approximately).
*    Virtual storage savings: about 600K, by allocating IDMS buffers to
the disk instead of to core.  No measurable performance degradation of
IDMS was experienced.

ADDITIONAL EXPERIMENTS AND FINDINGS

The following trials were made, using space made available for the
duration of the trial.  Somewhat to our surprise none resulted in a
measurable response time improvement, although these were reported from
other installations and could also be expected according to theory:

*    Allocating PLPA to the 7900 (this was tried both for the production
     and the test systems)
*    Allocating CICS temporary storage
*    Allocating the MSX index dataset One can only assume that having
     these datasets on a conventional device did not constitute a
     bottleneck.

Contrary to our expectations the following did not occur:

*    An increase in the paging rate
*    Increased CPU overhead due to the above.

SHORTCOMINGS

In spite of the undoubted benefits that the device has yielded in our
installation so far we found it has the following weak points.

Undirected paging

Before elaborating let it be stated that this is specific to 7900 page
datasets under MVS.  Unlike VM, MVS has no 'preferred page' option that
assigns specific paging devices to selected applications.  How then can
one direct the paging of critical subsystems to the 7900?  NAS offer the
following guidelines:

*    ASM will take care of most of the problems, as its algorithm
     will in any case tend to favour the faster device (within space
     limitations).

*    Bring up the 7900 page datasets by a PAGE ADD command after MVS is
     up and running, rather than declaring them in IEASYSxx.  This will
     keep them from being utilised in a comparatively unproductive way
     at IPL time.  Instead they will be used by the important active
     applications.

*    Reduce the number of page datasets on conventional devices.  This
     will tend to increase the probability of a given page going to the
     7900, all other things being equal.

Our experience shows that this works at least in a quantitative sense.
The 7900 datasets are 100% full most of the time and absorb about 35% of
the total paging while occupying only about 20% of the local paging
areas.  The response time improvements too speak for themselves.

The process is nevertheless a rather haphazard one as there is no prior
certainty that it is really CICS (or whatever) using the 7900 and not
some long- running batch job.  The alternative is to have enough 7900s
to take care of all the paging, but any installation except a very small
one will most likely find this prohibitively expensive.

Inflexible configuration

This problem also arises when the 7900 is used for paging.  At the time
of writing the configuration of the solid state device followed these
rules:

*    All logical disks must be the same size.  One cannot have some 8MB
     and some 16MB disks even though this might be advantageous.
*    All disks must run in the same emulation mode.  A mix of (say)
     3350s and 3380s is at present not supported.

These limitations are a disadvantage when part of the device is to be
used for paging and part for other datasets.  3330s are the best
emulation mode for paging datasets (see Figure 4 below) but may not be
practicable for files of data.  It is reasonable practice to keep
back-up copies of 7900 datasets on conventional disks in case a failure
of the 7900 occurs, but how many installations today still operate
3330s?

Insufficient space utilisation

This occurs when page datasets are allocated to emulated 3380s and 3350s
and is not a design fault of the 7900.  It is mentioned as the price of
storing a page effectively goes up by about 25% (see Figure 4 ).  There
will be no under- utilisation if the disks are used for data and the
allocation is made in tracks.

The unused spaces can be broken down as follows:

*    1 track - track zero
*    1 track - VTOC
*    1 cylinder - recovery area for a VSAM-owned disk
*    Some waste due to the fact that 8MB is not an exact multiple of
     cylinder size and that page datasets must start on cylinder
     boundaries.

As can be seen most of the under-utilisation is inherent in MVS.  Areas
whose size is negligible on a regular disk become very noticeable on the
emulated 3380s and 3350s.

PRODUCT EVALUATION AND DISCUSSION

The 7900 is a useful addition to the hierarchy of storage devices.
Given its fast access time (which judging by our experience conforms to
the supplier's specification) its best feature seems to be versatility.
It can be used for:

*    Storing critical datasets
*    Trading-off I/O and disk space for virtual storage
*    Trading-off I/O and disk space for real storage

It can be argued that MVS is not the ideal operating system under which
to use the 7900 for page datasets but this is a point that every
potential user will have to decide for himself.  Although we had no
direct experience it is quite likely that this function is better served
under VM or a virtual storage constrained DOS/VSE system.

Another open question is whether the 7900 will retain its usefulness
under MVS/XA or the future VM/XA.  Here again every installation will
have to decide for itself.  The facts remain that, even under XA,
systems require very fast access times for some datasets, and that they
are as likely to develop a real storage shortage as before XA.

Is a 3880 with a cache an alternative to a 7900?  I think the two
systems have different functions and the characteristics are not
comparable.
