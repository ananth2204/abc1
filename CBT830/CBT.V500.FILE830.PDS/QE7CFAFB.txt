A console clip utility

Here is a program that lets you clip, or re-label, disks from the
operator console.  This is handy because when you re-label a disk you
usually have to go into the computer room anyway to mount the pack, to
vary it off-line, or to reply to the WTORs from ICKDSF.  Once you're
inside, you can usually find an operator console a lot more readily than
you can a TSO terminal, or keypunch, or whatever you usually use to put
your clip jobs together.

This program takes the unit address and volume serial number you
specify, creates a control card for the IBM ICKDSF utility, and
dynamically invokes ICKDSF.  Then it scans the SYSPRINT file from ICKDSF
for messages and displays them on the operator console.

ICKDSF is an APF-authorised program, so CLIP must be link-edited with
AC=1 and put into an APF-authorised library.  If you don't do this, you
will get an S047 abend when ICKDSF is invoked.

To run CLIP, you need a procedure in SYS1.PROCLIB for the CLIP-started
task.

SAMPLE PROCEDURE

//CLIP     PROC U=,V=
//*  U IS THE UNIT ADDRESS
//*  V IS THE NEW VOLUME SERIAL NUMBER
//CLIP     EXEC PGM=CLIP,PARM='&U./&V.'
//SYSIN    DD   UNIT=SYSDA,SPACE=(TRK,(1,1))
//SYSPRINT DD   UNIT=SYSDA,SPACE=(TRK,(1,1))
