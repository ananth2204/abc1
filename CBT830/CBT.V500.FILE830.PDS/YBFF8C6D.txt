Correction to the July issue

A misunderstanding between our technical and editorial staff has
resulted in some code in the article A software availability monitor
being incorrectly modified.  In particular, the suppression of the
EQUATEs in the labels preceding WTO macro instructions causes
different alignments to be generated by these macro expansions
which can cause data to be moved to wrong addresses and could
even lead to 0C4 abends.  This occurs at labels WTO05, WTO06,
WTO07, WTO08, WTO00C, WTO02, FINALWTO, and
WTOESTAE.  For example:

WT005    WTO   ('OP0005I,C),...

should have read:

WT005    EQU   *
         WTO   ('OP0005I,C),...

In addition, the supression of the EQUATEs at labels FINAL and
ESTAE1 and the lack of a fullword in the label TIOTADDE cause
Assembler errors.

We apologise for any inconvenience this may have caused.
