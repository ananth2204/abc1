Validating MVS account codes and job classes

Most sites have a need to validate the use of account codes and,
possibly, job classes.  Ideally this should be done using standard
RACF or ACF2 resource profiles.  It is possible to use the IBM SMF
exit, IEFUJI, to perform this validation.  This exit is passed the
necessary information in a formatted control block and is much
simpler to write than an equivalent JES2 or JES3 exit.

This code should operate under both JES2 and JES3 and, providing
IBM maintains the SMF exit parameters as they are, should not be
affected by MVS or JES2/3 release changes.  Since the job will
have been initiated when this exit gets control, there is no need
for code to create RACF or ACF2 control blocks as there would be if
the exit were running in the JES2/3 address space.  The SMF
member of SYS1.PARMLIB should specify no invocation of IEFUJI
for started tasks, or the code should check the type of address
space since no accounting information is normally available for
started tasks.  To check the type of address space, use the ASCB as
the ASCBTSB field is set for TSO users and the name of the job or
task is found via either ASCBJBNI or ASCBJBNS according to
whether it was initiated (job) or a started task or a TSO user.  The
current ASCB address is found in the PSA field PSAAOLD, the PSA
being addressed from absolute zero.  If the need is only to
distinguish foreground users the JMRINDC field can be tested
against the mask JMRFIND (foreground initiated) as seen below.

* SMF EXIT IEFUJI, MUST BE CODED AND LINKED REENTRANTLY
* THIS VERIFIES FOR TSO AND BATCH THAT THE ACCOUNT CODE IS PERMITTED
* TO THE USER. THE EXIT IS NOT DESIGNED TO BE CALLED BY STARTED TASKS.
* THIS CODE CAN EXECUTE IN AMODE 24 OR 31 DUE TO THE USE OF RACROUTE
* RATHER THAN RACHECK. THIS MEANS THAT THE CLASS OF ACCOUNT MUST BE
* ADDED TO THE RACROUTE CLASS TABLE. ALTERNATIVELY CHANGE THE CODE TO
* USE RACHECK AND ACCEPT THE AMODE 24 RESTRICTION. THE CLASS ACCOUNT
* IS DEFINED TO RACF IN THE CLASS DESCRIPTOR TABLE WITH A LENGTH OF 8.
