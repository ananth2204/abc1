Eligible Device Table generation

This article details an IBM APAR that contains information
relating to the Eligible Device Table (EDT) generation
procedure. APAR OY19414 details how changes should be
made to the UNITNAME macros in the MVSCP source deck.

In the past I had never actually amended this table. Recently I
had to add a new entry to this table and, instead of adding this
at the end, I inserted it into the table alphabetically. This
seemed to be a valid way of maintaining the source deck.
However, after the system was IPLed and the new EDT was
invoked we started to obtain the message IEF210I when trying
to allocate catalogued datasets.

The problem arose because of the way I had amended the
source deck. Whenever UNITNAME macros are added they
should always be added at the end of the existing UNITNAME
macros, the reason for this being that whenever a utility
program, such as IEHPROGM or IDCAMS, accesses a dataset
using an esoteric device name, the catalog entry contains a
look-up value that corresponds to an offset in the EDT Name
Look-up Table. If an entry is added to the middle of the
UNITNAME source the link-edited output will contain
incorrect offsets. The table will no longer be matched with the
catalog entries because the catalog entries will still contain the
old offsets for the EDT Name Look-up Table. The result is
message IEF210I.

The previously mentioned APAR details that the
documentation will be amended to cover this feature of the
table. This article should be of interest to any system
programmer who has not read the MVSCP Guide and
Reference manual in detail.
