A program to empty a PDS

There is often a need to empty a Partitioned Data Set (PDS).  This may
be caused by testing, when you want to start over again, or during a
full SYSGEN, when you wish to copy your existing target library datasets
and keep their allocation but not their contents.  This program will
allow you to delete all the directory entries.

The program issues several data management macros to perform the
deletes.  Input is just the dataset name on the DD card of PDS.  Output
is an empty PDS and a message to the SYSPRINT DD card.  The program
issues one of the following messages based upon the execution of the
job:

*    PDS now contains no directory entries
*    PDS was already empty
*    Stow error
*    More than 12 000 members in PDS, table size exceeded - program must
     be changed.
