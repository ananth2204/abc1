Deleting catalog entries

The article Unconditional DFDSS restore by Karel Bastiaansen
in Issue 76 of MVS Update (January 1993) presents two
DFDSS exits to enable the removal of catalog entries for which
no datasets exist, so called phantom catalog entries. Readers
should be aware that DFDSS APAR PL72827 is now available,
which allows you to delete catalog entries while restoring
datasets.
