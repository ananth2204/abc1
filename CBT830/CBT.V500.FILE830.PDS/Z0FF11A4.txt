Tailoring ISPF to cater for square brackets for C

The most disliked feature of using C on the mainframe is that
the programmer cannot use the square brackets 'Ý' and '¨'. The
ANSI workaround for this problem was to introduce substitute
character sequences for these characters known as trigraphs.
The trigraphs for the square brackets are '??(' for 'Ý' and '??)'
for '¨'. While these work as required they do little to enhance
program readability.

At the time we introduced the new 3270 emulation (PC3270
Version 2) to our PS/2 network we decided to include the
square brackets in the keyboard mappings even though they
could not be used as such at the time. It could be seen that
some investigation into tailoring the ISPF translation tables
would be required before they could be used.

After close examination of the ISPF (&PDF) translation tables,
it was discovered that the 3278 table for APL terminals could
be used to display the square bracket symbols which are X'AD'
and X'BD' for 'Ý' and '¨' respectively. The terminal type is
defined to ISPF through option 0.1 (TERMINAL). As an
interim measure, an edit macro was written which performed
the following edit commands:

      CHANGE  '??('  x'AD'  all
      CHANGE  '??)'  x'BD'  all

This worked fine, since the C/370 compiler can accept the
EBCDIC characters for the square brackets. But still 'Ý' and '¨'
cannot be entered from the terminal. Further examination
revealed that ISPF edit was translating these characters into
X'BA' and X'BB' respectively. What we seemed to require
was a translation table that could convert X'BA' and X'BB'
into X'AD' and X'BD' respectively, combined with the display
capabilities of the 3278A (APL) table.

It required a close examination of the ISPAPLTT SAMPLIB
table to discover how to do it. There are a few undescribed
tables which needed to be added; and to make it all work, a bit
needed to be set in the ESCV field. An associated table called
ISR3278S also needed to be set up because ISPF will attempt
to load it when 3278S is specified as the terminal type. This is
another translation table which serves a similar purpose to
ISP3278S.

The following tables are based on the supplied SAMPLIB
tables ISPOWNTT and ISROWNTT. These tables need to be
assembled into the ISPLLIB concatenation before use and are
in use for ISPF/PDF V3.2. For brevity I have only included
those sections which vary from the sample tables. Modified
sections are underlined.
