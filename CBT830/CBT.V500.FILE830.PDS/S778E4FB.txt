An accounting information routine

Several weeks ago an application programmer asked me to
create a subroutine that would capture accounting information
for his billing system.  The accounting information he needed
consisted of the account number, job name, and programmer
name of the job that calls the subroutine.  All this information
is in the JCL job card.

After my research, I found that the system keeps the job name
information in the Job Control Table (JCT), while the account
number and the programmer name are in the Account Control
Table (ACT).  These control tables can be traced from the
current TCB as shown in Figure 1.

The program itself is very simple but a certain amount of
manipulation of some of the control block addresses is
required, notably:

o      The address of JSCB pointed by TCB has only 3 bytes, the
      same as the address of JCT pointed by JSCB.  To obtain
      their addresses, I zero the first byte of those addresses.

o      JCT points to the address of ACT on the first 3 bytes.  The
      last byte is reserved.  Right shifting is needed to obtain the
      ACT address.

o      JSCB points to the address of JCT minus X'10', not to the
      real JCT address.  The same thing happens on the ACT
      address.  Adjustments need to be made in the program to
      fit the real address.

Below are the account subroutine and the sample FORTRAN
program to call that subroutine.  In FORTRAN, I defined a
common area for the accounting information passed from the
routine.  The length of the account number is varied from shop
to shop: 144 characters are available, adjust accordingly to suit
your own environment.  Don't forget to link the account
subroutine with 31-bit AMODE and no call options.
