Reader's letter

In the January 1991 issue of MVS Update, an article entitled
Optimizing the processing of SMF data indicated there was a
PTF available under MVS/XA which would allow the default
4096 CISIZE to be changed to one more optimal for a 3380
DASD volume.  I reported this information to the IBM Support
Center with the intention of securing this PTF for my
installation.  The level 2 person informed me that there was no
PTF available for MVS/XA, only MVS/ESA.  She indicated
the MVS/ESA PTF was UY39437.

Since my installation is an MVS/XA site, a PTF for MVS/XA
would be quite beneficial to us.  I sincerely hope the IBM
Support Center is wrong.  We would greatly appreciate any
effort you can put forth to provide us with whatever
information you can determine from the author of the article
ÝHeinz-J©rgen Heitlènder¨.  We are naturally hoping for a PTF
number so we can order it accordingly from IBM.

The problem in SMF has been reported for XA as well as ESA
systems (APAR OY19862).  Unfortunately, a solution PTF has
only been made available for ESA systems (PTF UY39437).
This PTF enables various CI sizes to be used.  I'm afraid the
information from your IBM Support Center is correct.  As we
already run ESA, we never needed to look for a similar PTF in
XA.  It was my (wrong) assumption that an equivalent solution
would be made available for XA.  Nevertheless, it is possible,
and very helpful, to specify BUFND, even in XA.
