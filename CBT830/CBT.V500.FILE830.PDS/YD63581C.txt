Writing to multiple members in a PDS

This article describes a routine that can be used to write one or
more members to any PDS. The members of the PDS will be
processed as sequential files, which means that a new member
will be created if it does not already exist, and it will be
overwritten with new records if it does already exist. The PDS
must be allocated using JCL or TSO under the DDNAME
PDS. It must have record length of 80.

If the calling program is written in Assembler, the DCB of the
PDS must not be defined in the calling program. If the calling
program is written in COBOL, the PDS must not be defined as
a file in the calling program - this is because the DCB of the
PDS is defined in the called routine WTPDS.


PROCEDURE FOR USING THIS ROUTINE

Suppose you have a COBOL program in which you wish to
call WTPDS to write records to one or more members in a
PDS. In your calling COBOL program, define the following
area in your working storage section:

      01  WS-CALL-WTPDS-PARMS.
          05  FUNCTION         PIC X.
          05  PDS-MEMBER-NAME  PIC X(08).
          05  WTPDS-RET-CODE   PIC X.

For each member to be created or overwritten with new
records, do the following:

1      Execute the following code to open the desired PDS
      member for processing as a sequential file:

      MOVE 'O' TO FUNCTION.
      MOVE 'member-name'  TO PDS-MEMBER-NAME.
      MOVE SPACES TO WTPDS-RETURN-CODE.
      CALL 'WTPDS' USING FUNCTION PDS-MEMBER-NAME WTPDS-RET-CODE.

2      Execute the following code n times to write n records in
      the PDS member that was opened in step 1:

      MOVE 'W' TO FUNCTION.
      MOVE SPACES TO WTPDS-RETURN-CODE.
      CALL 'WTPDS' USING FUNCTION record-area WTPDS-RET-CODE.

      where record-area is to be replaced with the name of the
      actual area which contains the record to be written.

3      Execute the following code to close the PDS member that
      was opened in step 1:

      MOVE 'C' TO FUNCTION.
      MOVE SPACES TO WTPDS-RETURN-CODE.
      CALL 'WTPDS' USING FUNCTION PDS-MEMBER-NAME WTPDS-RET-CODE.
