SDSF/ACF2 exit revisited

The SDSF user exit for use with ACF2 published in issue 19 (April
1988) has been of great value to us.  However, in order to make it
work properly we needed to make a few changes.  We also added
a simple enhancement.

The exit was originally written for the FDP version of SDSF.  Part
of our problem was caused by the fact that we run the supported
version, SDSF 1.1.0 in which IBM has reworked the USERPARM
DSECT.  References to AUTHRETC must be changed to UPRARETC in
order to get a clean assembly.  Also, UACTCHAR has been changed
to UPRACTCR.  The exit was originally written to test this field for
an 'S' or 's'.  If the result of the test is positive it indicates that the
user was only trying to select the job for simple browsing.  A
check for ACF2 read authority will be made.  If the result of the
test were negative, a check for ACF2 write authority would be
made.

Unfortunately, UPRACTCR never contains 'S' or 's' (contrary to the
comments in element ISFAUTH!)  So we must check something
else instead.  We can get around this by taking advantage of the
structure of the call from ISFAUTH.  Register zero is set to indicate
why ISFUSER has been called.  Register zero values of 0, 4, 8, and C
indicate a call from initialisation, command processing, display
(select) processing, and clean-up, respectively.  So if register zero
contains the value '8' (at entry), the user has selected this job for
review.  In fact, ISFUSER uses this value as an offset into a branch
table to select the appropriate routine.  Unfortunately the routine
selected for command check processing contains only one
instruction (B RETURN), so if the user is trying to print or purge a
job, the exit does nothing, it just branches to the end.  Clearly this
instruction needs to be deleted to allow processing and to perform
the ACF2 validation call as promised.

Our management did not want users to be able to release
production jobs, it just wanted them to be able to view them.  So
at this point (the line after the CMDCK tag) we check UPRACTCR.
While never containing an 'S', this field will contain an 'A' if
someone is trying to release a job.  In this instance, 'B RETURN' is
appropriate.

One last problem remained.  In order for ISFUSER to override
ISFAUTH's decision, a statement must be added to set to zero the
full word flag UPRARETC.  This at least is documented in the
default exit delivered by IBM.

With these changes the exit worked for us as advertised under
SDSF 1.1.0.  It has been a big help to our user community.
