JES2 modification to hold SETUP messages

The JES2 /*SETUP control card is used to request that a volume is
mounted (usually a tape) before the job is released for execution (the
/*SETUP automatically holds the job).  However, the request to mount the
volume is issued as a rollable message and at most sites simply
disappears from the screen.

This modification causes the JES2 message to be issued as a Deletable
Operator Message (DOM), which remains displayed until the operator
deletes it.  This is useful for sites without a dedicated tape console.
Note that /*MESSAGE WTOs will also become DOMs after this change is made
to HASPRDR.

Be sure to check that the sequence numbers and code match your level of
JES2 in SYS1.HASPSRC before applying this usermod.
