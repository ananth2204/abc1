//***FILE 830 is from Eugene Vogt and contains Xephon MVS Update    *   FILE 830
//*           articles from July 1987 thru December 1996.  These    *   FILE 830
//*           articles are in EBCDIC format, the zip file having    *   FILE 830
//*           been expanded and converted into EBCDIC.  Now they    *   FILE 830
//*           are searchable and usable directly.                   *   FILE 830

//*           An oddity about the member names forces us to make    *   FILE 830
//*           3 indexes.  One is sorted by name, one is sorted      *   FILE 830
//*           by title, and one is sorted by article date.  This    *   FILE 830
