Note 1.  I tried to do change X'B0' X'5F' where applicable.
           ('Not sign' Â¬ in clists and rexx execs. Not in panels.)

         Members so changed have ISPF ID of FIXDNOT.     (SBG - CBT480)

Note 2.  Members marked with ISPF ID of FIXED were tested on a z/OS
         system and run.

Note 3.  Members marked with ISPF ID of FIXED0D were edited so that
         x'0D' printer characters were changed to null.  Sometimes
         a bit of further editing was done to neaten the text.

Note 4.  Members marked with ISPF ID of FILE836 were fixed for z/OS
         and added to File 836.  Similar notation FILEnnn for another
         CBT file.

Note 5.  The following (almost) global changes were made.
         x'69' to x'5C'    asterisks (for bullets)
         x'AC' to x'7D'    begin quote
         x'AD' to x'7D'    end quote
         x'DE' to x'5B'    for dollar sign
         I tried not to do these changes for obvious hex values.

Note 6.  The following (almost) global changes were made.
         x'BA' to x'AD'    open square brackets
         x'BB' to x'BD'    open square brackets    ISPF id of FIXEDBA
