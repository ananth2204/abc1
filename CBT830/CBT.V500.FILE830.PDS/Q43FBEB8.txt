RACF ICHPWX01 exit routine

The RACF product provides a variety of user interfaces to
allow users to develop and enhance the base product by using
exit routines.  Although we attempt the minimum amount of
customization at our site we have been forced to write a variety
of exits.  The exit presented here is an example of a simple
piece of code that can be easily maintained.

When we installed RACF it was decided that the interval for
the expiry of passwords would be 36 days.  This value was
chosen to comply with company policy.  After setting each
user profile we found that some users were changing their
password change interval with a RACF command.  To
overcome this problem we decided to use the RACF exit
presented here.

The exit routine will only allow users who have security
administration authorization to issue the command in question.
Full details about the exit routine and the parameters passed to
it can be obtained from IBM's manual RACF Systems
Programming Library.  The comments contained in the exit
routine will guide you through the processing performed by the
Assembler code.
