JES/RSCS modification

We run MVS/ESA 3.1.3 with JES2 3.1.1 as guests under
VM/XA 2.1 and quite often find it would be handy to re-queue
output from the spool (either held or output queues) to a CMS
machine or an RSCS-controlled printer. It is no problem to
alter the DEST value to that of an RSCS node known to JES,
but not so for the node (ie user-id/RSCS printer-id) which is
displayed as the 'writer' when doing a $D or looking on SDSF.
Even after updating this field successfully it has no effect on
RSCS, as RSCS doesn't actually use that field. However, we
came up with a modification to the HASPNET program which
actually transmits the Network Dataset Header to RSCS. If the
output is being sent to RSCS and there is a value in the 'writer'
field (NDHGXWTR), this is copied to the 'remote name' field
(NDHGRMT), which is what RSCS actually looks at.

Please note that this is a source update, so the sequence
numbers in columns 72 to 80 are important, as are the
PREREQs: it should be possible to use this USERMOD if you
do not have them on, but careful checking of the code after
label NSTHDXMT is highly advisable!

As the default SDSF output display has the DEST and WTR
fields on different screens (you need to use PF11 to get to
WTR), we have also changed our ISFPARMS to put these two
fields next to each other, to facilitate changing the fields
together.
