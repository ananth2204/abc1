Protecting catalogued tape files

A solution to the problem of protecting catalogued tape files was
presented in MVS Update, April 1987.  We employed the same basic idea of
locating catalogued tape files by a user type 3 SVC combined with ZAPs
in the OPEN and EOV modules.  Our tape protection mechanism includes
additional features.  One of these features addresses the 17 bytes
limitation of the tape header's DSN field.


THE PROBLEM

On the one hand the DSNs of tape datasets often exceed 17 characters (in
particular the DSNs of generation data groups), and on the other hand
all catalogued tapes should be write-protected.


THE SOLUTION

The FL1SYSCD field of a tape header 1 label is a constant.  In MVS SP1.3
this field's content is: IBM OS/VS 370.  Using FL1SYSCD as an extension
to the DSN field extends the DSN field length up to a maximum of 30
characters.  The leading characters are stored in the FL1SYSCD field,
while the last 17 characters are stored by OPEN and EOV routines in the
DSN field.


IMPLEMENTATION

A type 3 user SVC moves up to 13 characters to the FL1SYSCD field of
HDR1.  If the DSN is shorter than 18 characters, the same field is
spaced out.

The SVC is invoked by ZAPs in IFG0196T (OPEN) and IFG0552D (EOV).  These ZAPs
are applied by usermods in the SMP/E format and are currently installed on MVS
SP1.3.4 at put level 8508.

label, before issuing an SVC 26 (LOCATE).
