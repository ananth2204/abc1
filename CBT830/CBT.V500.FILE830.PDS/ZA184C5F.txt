PDS upload/download facility using CLISTs

Peter Rosenberg's article in the October 1991 issue describes a
PDS upload/download facility using REXX, which is a great
idea.  Many systems programmers are increasingly utilizing PC
facilities in many areas.  A quick upload/download facility for
PDSs is advantageous as typing many send/receive commands
on a PC can be very laborious.

Attached is a CLIST program that provides an example for
those systems programmers who are less familiar with REXX
or who just prefer CLISTs.  This CLIST is functionally the
same as Peter Rosenberg's REXX EXEC, but shorter. Refer to
Peter Rosenberg's article PDS upload/download facility in
Issue 61 of MVS Update  for procedures on how to use this
facility.


PROGRAM COMMENTS

1      When executing this CLIST a fully qualified dataset name
      is required as the parameter - for example:
      TSO %PCLOAD hlq.pdsname

2      There is no need to remove your TSO prefix when running
      this CLIST.

3      If you're not executing this CLIST within an ISPF
      environment change the ISPEXEC SETMSG commands to
      WRITE statements.

4      There is no error handling in the CLIST other than
      checking for a valid dataset and checking for valid
      members in that dataset.
