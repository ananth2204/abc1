TSO DDNAMEs with invalid DSAB open counts

INTRODUCTION

When running TSO CLISTs and/or REXX EXECs, you can run
into the situation where an abend or other interruption in
processing causes a field in the Data Set Association Block
(DSAB) not to be reset to zero after the associated DCB has been
closed. When this happens, the DDNAME associated with the
dataset cannot be freed and reallocated. The remedy for this at our
shop was to log on to TSO again, but since we have large
amounts of processing which occur in a log-on CLIST, it was
both time-consuming and resource-consuming to have to do this.

The UNOPEN program was written to allow for flipping the
DSAB open count when the error situation described above
occurs. UNOPEN needs to be APF-authorized to run: it must
also be in the SYS1.PARMLIB member IKJTSO00 (or whatever
suffix is used). The syntax for the specification in IKJTSO00 is:

      AUTHCMD NAMES(          /* AUTHORIZED COMMANDS       */  +
         UNOPEN               /* UNOPEN user command       */  +
                   )          /*                           */

In addition to the program, I have included a member that can be
used with the TSO HELP command to be copied to the
installation's appropriate help dataset with a member name of
UNOPEN.

TSO HELP Dataset Member UNOPEN

)F Function -

   UNOPEN - Advanced  command  to  make  freeable a  file  that  cannot
            be freed because the system thinks it is open.

            Under  certain circumstances,  when a program running under
            TSO abends or is otherwise interrupted, the DSAB associated
            with an open file  is  left with a open DCB count of 1 even
            though the DCB has been closed at task  termination.   This
            often happens when a  CLIST is interrupted while it has had
            a  file  open.   The  file  cannot be freed or reallocated,
            necessitating a new LOGON.

            This command should be used with the greatest caution lest
            you  mark a file as unopen  (0 open DCBs in the DSAB)  and
            free it while it is really open.   If  you  do  this,  the
            results will be unpredictable.
)X SYNTAX

   UNOPEN DDNAME NOBUMP|BUMP

Default: NOBUMP

   At completion of processing, &LASTCC will be set to:
        00 - No errors.
        08 - No appropriate DDNAME found.

)O OPERANDS

)P'DDNAME'  - The DDNAME to be marked as not open (or to be marked
              as open if BUMP is specified).

))NOBUMP    - The file erroneously marked as open will be marked as
              not open.

))BUMP      - The file marked as not open will be marked as open.
