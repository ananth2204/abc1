The TSO SLEEP command

The following TSO command, SLEEP, is similar to the VM/CMS SLEEP
command.  This version only accepts input in seconds, which is
sufficient for our needs.

The format of the command is:

     SLEEP nnn

where nnn is the number of seconds for which the TSO user will be made
to wait.
