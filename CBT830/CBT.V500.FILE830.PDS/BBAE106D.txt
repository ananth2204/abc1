Edit macro to invoke a CLIST against edited file

I've written a little ISPF edit macro to invoke a CLIST or TSO
command against the file currently being edited.  This is for
situations where you don't want to bother re-typing the
complete file name of whatever it is you have just finished
editing, eg for an R90AFP, PRINTDS, DSPRINT, PRINTL,
PRINTC, or SCRIPT invocation.  This is also handy when you
just can't squeeze all those extra operands onto that all-too-
short ISPF command line.

To invoke the macro, which I have called CL, you must be in
ISPF edit on the file or member you wish to process with a
CLIST.  At the command line, simply enter CL.  If you have
edited your file but not yet saved it, CL will terminate with an
error message asking you to save the file and try again.  This is
a safety feature, to guard against operating on old data.  You
will be prompted for the name of the CLIST to be invoked, and
for three lines of operands to be used by the CLIST after your
dataset name.  The CLIST name and operands are saved for
subsequent invocations of CL.  CL then invokes the requested
CLIST, supplying the dataset name of the file currently being
edited as the first operand of the CLIST, and your other
operands following the dataset name.  CL then returns to edit
mode.

You can also optionally supply CL with the CLIST name and
up to eight operands, all on the command line.  For example,
CL DSPRINT T075 would immediately request a local print of
the file on printer T075, without displaying any operand
request panel.
