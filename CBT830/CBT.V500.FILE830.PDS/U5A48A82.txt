Execution of CLISTs in batch

It may be desirable to exploit the full range of CLIST facilities in
batch combining the use of TSO commands, programming logic, and CLIST
built-in functions.  The IBM TSO/E manual states that a terminal session
can be executed in batch, ie  any command that can be entered on a TSO
terminal can be put into a CLIST that can be submitted to background;
this statement excludes the use of CLIST programming statements such as
assignment statements and logic statements together with the built-in
functions.

Fortunately, calling a CLIST from a TSO terminal by entering the name of
the CLIST preceded by a % sign is a valid TSO command, and therefore
also valid in batch, provided the CLIST exists as a member in a PDS
under the DDNAME SYSPROC.

A CLIST called in this indirect way under batch will function correctly
even for the full range of CLIST facilities.  For example:

//STEP1   EXEC   PGM=IKJEFT01,DYNAMNBR=128,PARM='%XYZ'
//SYSTSPRT  DD   SYSOUT=*
//SYSTSIN   DD   DUMMY
//SYSPROC   DD   DSN=A.B.CLIST,DISP=SHR
or
//STEP1   EXEC   PGM=IKJEFT01,DYNAMNBR=128
//SYSTSPRT  DD   SYSOUT=*
//SYSPROC   DD   DSN=A.B.CLIST,DISP=SHR
//SYSTSIN   DD   *
%XYZ

where IKJEFT01 is the name of TSO.  Use DYNAMNBR to allow dynamic
allocations.  XYZ is the name of the CLIST in PDS A.B.CLIST and the DD
statements SYSTSPRT and SYSTSIN are required for the execution of TSO in
batch.

The CLIST can either be called via the PARM field on the EXEC statement
or it can be placed as a command in SYSTSIN.  If an in-line/in-job CLIST
is desirable, instead of putting the CLIST in a different library, the
following technique can be used:

//STEP1      EXEC PGM=IEBGENER
//SYSIN      DD   DUMMY
//SYSPRINT   DD   SYSOUT=*
//SYSUT2     DD   DSN=&TEMP(GO),DISP=(,PASS),UNIT=VIO,
//  SPACE=(CYL,(1,1,1))
//SYSUT1     DD   *
This is the CLIST:
//STEP2      EXEC PGM=IKJEFT01,DYNAMNBR=128,PARM='%GO'
//SYSTSPRT   DD   SYSOUT=*
//SYSTSIN    DD   DUMMY
//SYSPROC    DD   DSN=&TEMP,DISP=(OLD,DELETE)

The facility of using CLISTs in batch is a very powerful tool in
managing an MVS system and developing utility functions.
