Sending messages under MVS

The following program was written to try to simplify an operator's life.
It is a console-started task invoked by the operator when needed.

The SENDTO program will send a message at multiple times to a designated
user or MVS console.  It was written to avoid having to repeat SEND
commands from the console.  The message text allowed is a maximum of 70
bytes but may be modified easily.  The syntax of the commands is:

S SENDTO.CN04,MSG='ANY TEXT YOU WISH UP TO 70 BYTES'
S SENDTO.tsouser,MSG='ANY TEXT YOU WISH UP TO 70 BYTES'
S SENDTO.BRODCAST,MSG='ANY TEXT YOU WISH UP TO 70 BYTES'
S SENDTO.ALL,MSG='ANY TEXT YOU WISH UP TO 70 BYTES'

The step name coded in the MVS START command is used to indicate where
the message should be sent.  In the following routine, the format S
SENDTO.CNxx is used to send messages to an MVS console where xx is the
two-digit console-id.  The format S SENDTO.tsouser is used to send
messages to the specified TSO user where tsouser is the individual TSO
user-id.  The form S SENDTO.BRODCAST is used to send messages to all MVS
consoles and the S SENDTO.ALL form is used to send the message to all
logged on TSO users.

Some uses for SENDTO are to avoid having to re-type a message or hit the
DUP key on the console to repeat it.  We also use the console form to
send messages to our tape library, when requested tapes are not on the
computer room floor, asking the librarian to pull the tapes and bring
them out.  It is also used in the 'all TSO users' form to send
notifications of problems or upcoming system outages to all TSO users.

This program must be assembled and link-edited into either an
APF-authorised library in the LINKLIST or in a load library, that can be
pointed to by a STEPLIB DD card.
