More about condition code checking

In MVS Update, issue 42, the article Condition code checking
in JCL describes a method of controlling a job stream through
two user-written programs.  The program WBMAXCC is a
solution to a problem that doesn't really exist.

The program IEFBR14 and a smart COND parameter are all
that are required to achieve the same result.  For example, the
same result could have been obtained with the following JCL:

      //EXPORT1  EXEC PGM=IDCAMS
      //EXPORT2  EXEC PGM=IDCAMS
      //EXPORT3  EXEC PGM=IDCAMS
      //MAXCC    EXEC PGM=IEFBR14,COND=(4,LT)
      //NOTIFY   EXEC PGM=WBSEND,
      //         COND=((0,LE,MAXCC),EVEN),
      //         PARM='*** JOB CATEXPRT HAS FAILED ***'

The last step will execute if any of the export steps fail with an
abend or a condition code of 5 or more.

The MVS JCL manual says that if a step is bypassed (in this
case, MAXCC) and it doesn't produce a return code, then any
COND test that refers to that step is ignored.

In our example, suppose the MAXCC step was not executed
because of a condition code of 5 or more, then the NOTIFY
step will execute because the step will have no remaining
conditions to be checked against.  The '(0,LE,MAXCC)' and
the 'EVEN' portions are ignored because no abend has
occurred.
