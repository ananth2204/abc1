An ISPF edit macro for change control

An example of an edit macro to track changed statements is
shown in SC34-4018 ISPF/PDF Edit Macros.  The following is
an improved version which is able to show any level of change.
Note that deleted statements are not recorded and therefore can
not be tracked.

 /*   EDIT MACRO TO FIND STATEMENTS CHANGED
 /*   PARAMETER: EXPLICIT LEVEL TO LOOK FOR (OPTIONAL); WILL DEFAULT
 /*              TO LATEST LEVEL.
 /*   SECOND PARAMETER: IF SPECIFIC LEVEL LESS THAN LATEST LEVEL SHOULD
 /*              BE SEARCHED, SPECIFY: ONLY. WILL DEFAULT TO LOOK FOR
 /*              ALL LEVELS EQUAL TO OR HIGHER INDICATED IN FIRST
 /*              PARM, IF ANY.
