REXX CLIST to display the APF and LNKLST

INTRODUCTION

With ESA came the new (to MVS) language of REXX,
although it has been available on VM for several years.  The
MVS implementation has a few commands that are unique to
MVS and one of these commands is the storage command.
This command allows storage to be retrieved from specified
addresses (and replaced if necessary).

REXX has several commands for changing the format of data
(eg from hexadecimal to character, character to decimal etc)
that make it ideal for manipulating control block data.  The two
REXXs here display the APF table and LNKLST table from
their respective locations in storage.

It should be noted that the initialization routines have added the
default libraries to the lists, which may make them slightly
longer than the PARMLIB equivalents.
