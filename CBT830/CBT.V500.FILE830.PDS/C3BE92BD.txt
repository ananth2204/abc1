Automatic mounting of direct access volumes

The method for ensuring desired mount attributes of DASD volumes at IPL
time (described in MVS Update, issue 21, June 1988, in the article
Automatic mounting of direct access volumes) is quite complex.  Most
users simply want to change the IBM default for volumes not in the
VATLST from PUBLIC to some other attribute to prevent undesirable
dataset allocations.

The following USERMOD is much simpler than the method described in the
article and satisfies the requirement to change this PUBLIC default
attribute to PRIVATE/RESERVED for all volumes not in the VATLST.  I
first developed this ZAP in 1973 to fix the same problem for OS and
passed it around to my colleagues on the SHARE OS/MVT-MFT project.  The
ZAP as shown is current for MVS/XA at level 2.1.2.  With MVS/ESA the ZAP
will be unnecessary; IBM will allow the user to specify default
attributes in MVS/ESA.

Once the ZAP is applied, your SYS1.PARMLIB VATLST member need only
include those volumes that must be PUBLIC, STORAGE, and/or just 'up'
(the Y parameter) at IPL time.
