A simple conditional step execution program


INTRODUCTION

Depending on the parameter it is passed, the following
program, which is called TODAY, sets a return code to denote
the day of the week, the day of the month, the month of the
year, or the Julian date. It was initially developed for the
conditional execution of certain steps within a job stream on
specific days and/or dates. The following examples will
illustrate its usage.

Example 1

Only execute the WEEKLY step on Sunday.

      .
      //DOW     EXEC PGM=TODAY,PARM='19DOW'
      .
      //WEEKLY  EXEC PGM=xxxxxxxx,COND=(1,DOW)

Example 2

Execute the MONTHLY step on the first day of each month.

      .
      //DOM     EXEC PGM=TODAY,PARM='19DOM'
      .
      //MONTHLY EXEC PGM=xxxxxxxx,COND=(1,DOM)

Example 3

Execute the XMAS step on December 25 of each year.

      .
      //MOY     EXEC PGM=TODAY,PARM='19MOY'
      //DOM     EXEC PGM=TODAY,PARM='19DOM'
      .
      //XMAS    EXEC PGM=xxxxxxxx,COND=((12,MOY),(25,DOM))

Example 4

Execute the PERIOD step every 91 days.

      .
      //JJJ     EXEC PGM=TODAY,PARM='19JJJ'
      .
      //PERIOD  EXEC PGM=xxxxxxxx,COND=((91,JJJ),(182,JJJ),
      //                              (273,JJJ),(364,JJJ))
