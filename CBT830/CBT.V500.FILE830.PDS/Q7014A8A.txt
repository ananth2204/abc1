Executing operator commands from a program

The following subroutine has been developed to execute any
operator command from a program.  This command is useful in
re-routing any SYSOUT datasets or jobs to be executed for
automated operations.  The length of the operator command
must not exceed 126 bytes and the calling program must be
linked 'AC=1' and reside in an authorized library.  We have
further restricted this command to the RACF operation group
user.  The calling sequence of this subroutine is as follows:

      CALL COMMND(X)

where COMMND is the entry name of the subroutine and X is
a character string containing the command to be executed.  The
length of the character string must not exceed 126 bytes.

*   TAKE A CHARACTER STRING FROM THE ARGUMENT AND USE SVC34 TO
*   STICK IT INTO MVS AS AN OPERATOR COMMAND. USES MODESET SO
