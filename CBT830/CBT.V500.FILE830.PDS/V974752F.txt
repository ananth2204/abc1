How to enter or re-enter TSO/E dynamically

IBM states that the TSO Session Manager can only be entered via TSO
log-on using the following EXEC statement in the log-on procedure:

//TSO      EXEC PGM=ADFMDF03,DYNAMNBR=128,PARM='SM(IKJEFT01,Y)'

If Session Manager is terminated via clear and end then a new log-on
using the above log-on procedure is required.  Likewise, a TSO session
started via normal EXEC PGM=IKJEFT01 can never enter Session Manager.
This limitation can be circumvented by implementing a TSO command as
follows (the routine is currently working successfully in a TSO/E
Version 2 environment):

*  THIS PROGRAM CAN REENTER A SESSION MANAGER SESSION FROM TSO AFTER
*   HAVING TERMINATED SESSION MANAGER OR NEVER LOGGED ON TO SESSION
*   MANAGER.
*  TSO COMMAND: SESSMGR
*   THIS PROGRAM USES INSTALLATION MACROS AUTHON AND AUTHOFF TO GET
*   AND LEAVE AUTHORISED STATUS.

         LINK  EP=ADFMDF03,PARAM=DUMMYPRM SESSION MANAGER
         AUTHOFF                        see issue 10 page 24
         EXITR                          see issue 15 pages 25-26
DUMMYPRM DC    0F'0',H'0',CL100' '      EMPTY PARM LIST
         LTORG
         END

When issuing this TSO command, the Session Manager environment is
entered dynamically.  There is a minor side effect of invoking Session
Manager dynamically; the TSO log-off abends with S0C4 because the TMP is
not aware of the Session Manager environment.  Do not invoke Session
Manager from ISPF; it will eventually inhibit SESSMGR in ISPF table
ISPTCM.
