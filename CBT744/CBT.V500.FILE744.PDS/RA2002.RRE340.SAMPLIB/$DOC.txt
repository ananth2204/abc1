THIS DATASET CONTAINS RACF TOOLS
THAT RACF INSTALLATIONS MAY FIND USEFUL.




PURPOSE:
- TO VERIFY ALL RACF PROFILES AGAINST A HR/CD/ID SYSTEM AND VICE VERSA.
- TO VERIFY ALL RACF PROFILES AGAINST A SET OF USER DEFINED 'RULES'.
- TO ENFORCE NAMING CONVENTIONS IN A RACF ENVIRONMENT WITHOUT HAVING TO
- TO SIMPLIFY FUTURE AUDITS.
- TO REDUCE THE IMMENSE COSTS OF ANY FUTURE RACF AUDITS.

  STANDARDS
- TO HAVE A BETTER CONTROL OVER ALL RACF PROFILES.
- TO BE ABLE TO MANAGE MULTIPLE CLIENTS.
- TO VERIFY SETROPTS SETTINGS.




MOST RACF INSTALLATIONS DO NO LONGER KNOW WHY CERTAIN USER-IDS ARE
CONNECTED TO VARIOUS RACF GROUP-IDS.  EVEN WHEN INSTALLATIONS
UTILIZE A CORPORATE DIRECTORY (ID OR CD OR HR) IT NEVER MATCHES
THE RACF ENVIRONMENT 100%.  OWNERSHIP OF PROFILES IS NOT UP-TO-DATE.

ESPECIALLY LARGE CORPORATIONS WITH MANY DECENTRALIZED RACF
ADMINISTRATORS FACE THE IMMENSE PROBLEM TO ENFORCE STANDARDS.
MANUALLY CONTROLLING SUCH RACF ENVIRONMENTS IS ALMOST IMPOSSIBLE.
HOME-GROWN TOOLS ARE IN MANY CASES NO SOLUTION EITHER
TO THE WELL KNOWN PROBLEM
