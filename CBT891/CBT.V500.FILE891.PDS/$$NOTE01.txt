Hi Sam,

I would like to contribute my tool to CBT Tape. The tool is
called MINE.

MINE is a powerful REXX utility developed to build the structure
chart of a COBOL source. Just press <PF1> under any paragraph. A
visual diagram that shows all calling paragraphs and called
paragraphs is displayed on the screen.

Pressing <PF2> on any PERFORM <para> statement, allows you to
jump directly to the called paragraph. Press <PF4> within the
called paragraph, takes you back the last PERFORM statement. You
can traverse upto any number levels and back up.

This script implements several data-structures in Rexx. MINE was
written keeping in mind, a structured top-down programming
methodology. It is therefore, divided into several smaller
routines. MINE also uses two panels DYNAREA and MINEMSG.

You may invoke MINE on the ISPF Editor. The syntax is MINE
<function>, where <function> parameter could be IN, OUT or GRAPH.
I have set my PFKeys as <PF1> - MINE GRAPH, <PF2> - MINE IN and
<PF4> - MINE OUT.

Attached herewith, please find MINE.XMI in the binary format.
Please let me know, if the file's fine.

Thank you very much,
Quasar
