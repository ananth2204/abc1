Subject:  Small (very!) suggestion for FILE891

Quasar, the MINE exec looks very interesting!  I do have one
change I would like to recommend, however.  Instead of setting up
PF keys, I was doing some basic testing on the exec by typing in
the commands on the command line of the edit (or view) session.
I couldn't get it to do anything, it would just take the command
and return to the session as if I had just pressed enter!
Needless to say, this was not a desirable result.  However, the
problem (and the fix) is very simple - the exec doesn't like
parameters in lower case!  If you add this one line, there is no
more problem with this issue:

...
/* KEY-PRESS IS INTERCEPTED AND THE PARA_STACK VARIABLE IS CLEARED. */
/*__________________________________________________________________*/

  CALL INITIALIZATION

  PARM = TRANSLATE(PARM)  <-- add this line

  IF PARM = 'IN' THEN DO
...

The default behavior of the TRANSLATE function is simply to
return the provided argument translated to upper case.  Lower
case input is no longer a problem...

Best regards,
-Mike
