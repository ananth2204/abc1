   I have reworked most of the  IO* execs so that they run under z/OS.
The most recent version of z/OS that I have tested is z/OS V1.13. I have
updated these so that yopu can run the SAS code provided in file 220 to
produce the desired reports.

Corrections for the following errors:


All IO* routines
  "See member $$WORKDS for more details"

IOAPFP
 Error
  16 +++ @cvtauthl = D2X(C2D(@cvtauthl))             /* binary to hex */
  IRX0040I Error running IOAPFP, line 16: Incorrect call to routine
 Fix
  Add support for Dynamic APF table format.

IOPCAUTH
 Error
  Did NOT produce any output because the format of the report changed!
 Fix
  Modify exec to find values in the correct rows.

LISTAPFT
 Error
  16 +++ @cvtauthl = D2X(C2D(@cvtauthl))             /* binary to hex */
  IRX0040I Error running IOAPFP, line 16: Incorrect call to routine
 Fix
  Add support for Dynamic APF table format.

LISTCATS
 Error
  Did NOT provide volser for non-Master catalogues.
 Fix
  Corrected control block offsets for non-Master catalog volsers.

LISTCONS
 Error
  Did NOT provide UCB addr for 4-character UCBs.
 Fix
  Added support for 4 chracter UCB addressses and console names.

LISTPART
 Error
  Did NOT provide the page dataset names. Only supported 3 character
  device addresses.
 Fix
  Modified the exec to correctly determine the 32 bit PART address and
  to support 4 charater device addresses.

LISTSMF
 Error
  59 +++  capty = C2D(rdscapty)
  IRX0040I Error running LISTSMF, line 59: Incorrect call to routine
 Fix
  Fixed a problem with the length of the SMF selectivity Table and some
  control bloack offsets.

VSDATA
 Error
  21 +++ @cvtauthl = D2X(C2D(@cvtauthl))             /* binary to hex */
  IRX0040I Error running IOAPFP, line 16: Incorrect call to routine
 Fix
  Increase numeric digits setting.


Additional members:


LISTAPF2

 A version of the LISTAPFT command with a different output format.

LISTPAR2

 A version of the LISTPART command that provides output in a format
 similar to the D ASM command. (Page D/S name on the right side)


Additional notes:

  The command to clear the screen has many different names in various
shops. If you have a "CLEAR" command to clear a TSO screen then you DO
NOT need the one provided here. If you don't, there is assembly source
code and JCL to build one graciously provided by Sam Golob, courtesy
of Gerhard Postpischil.  The member names are CLEAR and CLEAR$.

  The LISTDASD and LISTTAPE execs will only "find" those devices that
are defined on 3-character UCBs.
  If you need support for 4-character UCB devices, I suggest using Sam
Golob's UCBDASD and UCBTAPE commands which can be found on FILE 731.


Still Need work:

  The above listed execs are the only ones that I have updated. The was
basically the execs that were needed to produce the WORK datasets that
the SAS code if FILE 220 needs to produce reports.

The reset of the collections still needs work to function completely!!!
