There are (9) IOxxxx execs in CBT File221. These execs all write to
datasets on DASD. In their original form, the fully qualified dataset
name was "hard-coded" in the exec amd they were allocated with a
disposition of OLD.

I have modified these routines to ALLOCate the work datasets using
the Userid (SYSVAR(sysuid)) of the person that invokes the exec. The
execs currently expect these datasets to exist, so I suggest pre-
allocating them using the DCB atributes listed below. Please choose
a suitable BLKSIZE for the DASD type(s) where they will reside!

                                         Dsorg  Recfm    Lrecl
  sysuid.APFLIST.DATA.WORK                 PS    FB        80
  sysuid.APFPGMS.DATA.WORK                 PS    FB       200
  sysuid.ESRS.DATA.WORK                    PS    FB       120
  sysuid.LLTLIST.DATA.WORK                 PS    FB        80
  sysuid.LLTPGMS.DATA.WORK                 PS    FB       200
  sysuid.LPALIST.DATA.WORK                 PS    FB        80
  sysuid.LPAPGMS.DATA.WORK                 PS    FB       200
  sysuid.LPAQMODS.DATA.WORK                PS    FB       200
  sysuid.NUCMAP.DATA.WORK                  PS    FB       120
  sysuid.PCAUTH.DATA.WORK                  PS    VBA      125
  sysuid.PLPAMODS.DATA.WORK                PS    FB       200
  sysuid.SVCS.DATA.WORK                    PS    FB       200

Once the WORK datasets are allocated, the execs can be executed
repetitively and they will reuse the datasets.

NOTE:
Be careful NOT to allocate an insufficient LRECL. This will NOT
likely generate an error, however, it will cause data truncation
and that will cause problem running the SAS programs in File 220.
