Hi Sam,

Sorry that it took a while, but I have finally documented my
updates and changes to CBT file221. The execs in file 221 work in
conjunction with programs and SAS code in file 220. This was a
nice little history lesson in the evolution from MVS XA 2.2 to
z/OS V1.13.

I have added two members ($$MODS and $$WORKDS) to the PDS that,
hopefully describe the change that I made in order to get these
execs to run under z/OS 1.13. I started by updating only those
that were necessary to run the associated SAS jobs in file 220.
As of this email, I have updated most , but NOT all of them.

Please find the modified PDS attached to this email in TSO IDTF
(XMIT) format!!!

Please let me know if you have any questions or require any
additional documentation.

Thanks
Tony
