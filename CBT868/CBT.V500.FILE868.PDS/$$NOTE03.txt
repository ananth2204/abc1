Hello Sam,

I've checked the current file 868, and I've seen that you have
put just the version 0.2.0. I suggest you to keep in the file
both versions 0.1 and 0.2, for some reasons:

1)      I've massively used just the 0.1, and the 0.2 has just
        been written. So, also if I've tried the new version in
        some circumstance, I believe it needs some more test.

2)      The 0.2 uses an assumption coming from RDC
        'reverse-engineering', and so far I've not found any IBM
        documentation about it.

3)      The 0.2 uses the relatively new macro TRKADDR for tracks
        math, and maybe there's still someone who wants to use
        the program with an old z/OS version. I could write the
        program without using the macro, for example just putting
        in it the macro expansions, but I don't like this
        solution. If someone has an old z/OS version, without the
        EAV support, perhaps he doesn't care about the new
        absolute and normalized track address format, and he
        could prefer to reduce the output.

Best regards,
Claudio.
