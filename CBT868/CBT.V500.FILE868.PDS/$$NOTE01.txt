Hello Sam,

Recently we have had a specific necessity, so the attached
program has been created.

It is a simple (?) assembler program able to perform a
track-by-track compare of two offline dasd packs.

Because I believe it could of interest for someone else, I've
decided to send it to you to see if it could be suitable for
cbttape.

Its invocation is pretty simple and intuitive, so I'm not sure if
further explanations and comments are needed:

*   Invocation:
*      //step   EXEC PGM=DISKCOMP,
*      //       PARM='unit1,unit2,locyl,hicyl,msgddn'
*      //STEPLIB  DD DISP=SHR,DSN=apf.authorized.loadlib
*      //msgddn   DD SYSOUT=*
*
*    locyl, hicyl and msgddn are optional
*
*    locyl defaults to 0
*    hicyl defaults to highest cylinder on smallest unit
*    msgddn defaults to SYSPRINT

The attached file is the source in zipped XMIT format.

Best regards,
Claudio Mauceri.
