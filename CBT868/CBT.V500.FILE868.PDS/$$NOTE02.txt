Hello Sam,

I've tried to modify the program in order to support EAV.

The strategy is simple: if in the last 4 bytes of RDC there's a
value different from zero, the program uses it instead of
RDCprime. Then there's just some math to play between absolute
and normalized track address (I've used the standard TRKADDR to
perform this stuff). Every change to program has been labeled
@020.

I've tried in several condition, with 3390-3/9 and 3390-A with
more of 65520 cyls, and it seems to work just fine. Here's a
sample of the new output; note the two different track formats,
i.e. CCCC:cccH (absolute) and cccCCCC:H (normalized):

diskcomp 0.2.0 starting compare 16 Apr 2012 14:53:26, unit1=e035,
        unit2=e034, locyl=0017d00, hicyl=0017dff
7d48:0010 (0017d48:0) length  mismatch, length1 is 24, length2 is 49272
7d48:0011 (0017d48:1) length  mismatch, length1 is 24, length2 is 49272...

Or, when packs are different:

Device e035 has 100170 cyls, device e030 has 3339 cyls.
        Defaulting to 0000d0a for high cyl
diskcomp 0.2.0 starting compare 16 Apr 2012  4:23:29, unit1=e035,
        unit2=e030, locyl=0000000, hicyl=0000d0a
0000:0000 (0000000:0) compare mismatch
0000:0001 (0000000:1) compare mismatch
0005:0000 (0000005:0) length  mismatch, length1 is 49224, length2 is 43200
0005:0001 (0000005:1) length  mismatch, length1 is 49224, length2 is 43200...

The problem is that the preliminary assumption (use of last four
RDC bytes) comes just from observation and not from any IBM
documentation.  So, I can't be sure that it will work in future,
and may be is too early to give it to community.  I would like to
have some beta-tester... for sure I forgot to consider some
nibble somewhere.

Ciao,
Claudio.
