History



" 1979 - Created by Ian Cairns working for Software Design
         Associates, Australia-

" Written in Assembler

" 1981 - Goal Systems bought the marketing rights-

" 1992 - Legent acquired Goal Systems-

" 1995 - Computer Associates purchased Legent-

" Computer Associates still owns the marketing rights, but
  Software Design Associates owns the software-

" Both Software Design Associates and Computer Associates develop
  and maintain PDSMAN-






Introduction



1- EZYEDIT
    " Enhanced ISPF 3-4

2- FASTCOPY
    " High-speed replacement for IEBCOPY with a lot of
      enhancements

3- Library Space Reuse
    " Provides a way to avoid nearly all PDS out-of-space
      conditions by dynamically reusing the "dead" areas with in
      the library-

4- LLA/Extensions and Performance Options
    " Reduces DASD I/O and can improve overall system performance
      by eliminating many of the directory searches performed for
      PDS members- This is achieved either by assisting you in
      using the IBM LLA facility to its fullest benefit or by using
      the performance options included with PDSMAN

5- Library Member Archiving
    " Free DASD resources by allowing you to identify, archive,
      and purge inactive library members, based upon the date on
      which they were last referenced-

6- Library Member Recovery
    " Allows us to easily recover both the current and previous
      versions of your library members when such recovery is
      required-

7- PDSMAN Auditing Facility
    " Allows us to better control and manage library resources-
      This saves you time when developing new applications,
      undergoing an audit, performing maintenance, or doing the
      day-to day management of your libraries and also improves
      both the security and integrity of your library data-

8- PDSMAN Comparison
    " Allows us to better control changes in your library
      environment by providing utilities to easily identify
      libraries and members that have changed and what those
      changes are-





Started Task



    1- Started task

        " PDSMAN
        " LIB-SYS-STC-PROCLIB

    2- Init Deck

        " PDSMINIT
        " LIB-SYS-STC-PARMLIB
            " Used to customize PDSMAN
        " All PDSMANs in the SYSPLEX use the same parm deck-

    3- Communications File

        " PDSMMCPU   DD   DISP=SHR,DSN=LIB-SPP-PDSMAN-MCPU<site>
          Where <site> is CHL, JAX, URP, DEV, etc-

        " Used to communicate LLA changes to other PDSMANs in the
          sysplex-

        " This facility can be disabled by removing the DD card-


    4- Items of Interest

        " If you have a STEPLIB in PDSMAN proc it will be in
        "TEST MODE"- This means that anyone wanting to use it
        must also use a "STEPLIB"-

EZYEDIT Command Shell


Alternative to ISPF command shell (ISPF 6) to invoke TSO
commands, CLISTS, REXXs and ISPEXEC functions- To invoke the
Ezyedit Command Shell type in TSO ?  on the ISPF primary command
line, you do not have to be in Ezyedit or PDSMAN to use this
feature-

The Ezyedit Command Shell Display is a powerful, easy-to-use
platform for executing TSO commands, CLISTs, or REXX execs- The
display remembers the most recent commands you have executed and
allows you to define and save your own commands- You can enter
commands to be executed directly on the display- You can also,
execute any of the saved commands by entry number, label, or by
simply positioning the cursor over the desired entry-


1- Primary Command Area

" Extends for three lines to allow for long commands or multiple
  commands separated by the command delimiter character-


2- Temporary Command Area

" Ezyedit Command Shell saves the eight most recently executed
  unique commands in a push-down list called the Temporary Command
  area-
" As new commands are executed, they are added to the top of the
  list and the oldest entry is dropped-


3- Permanent Command Area

" Provides an area where you can save your own commands,
  including those you execute frequently or commands with long or
  complex syntax-
" Can assign your own command labels to the entries to make it
  easier to remember- Labels can be up to 16 characters in length
  and must begin with an alphabetic character- They must start in
  column 1 and should be immediately followed by the label
  delimiter character, a colon ":"- You should not choose names
  that are actual ISPF Primary Commands-


4- Other Items of Interest

" When multiple commands are present, they are executed in order
  from left to right
" Maximum length of saved command is 252 characters
" Saved commands are automatically converted to upper case




5- Special Characters

?   <label | nn>   Change a command before executing
&   <label | nn>   Repeat command-  Execute command and retain in on
                   primary command line-
*-  <label | nn>   Trap and browse the output from TSO commands
:                  Label character
\                  Command delimiter character
/                  Cursor data character


6- SET Statement

 SET PERMCOUNT nnnn Increase no of Permanent slots- Cannot reduce
                    slots-
 SET CMDLBL x       Change label character, default is ":"
 SET RECALL x       Change recall character, default is ?
 SET REPEAT x       Change repeat character, default is &
 SET CMDDEL x       Change command delimiter character, default is \
 SET CMDDEL ISPF    Set command delimiter equal to that used by ISPF
 SET CMDTRAP x      Change trap and browse character, default is -
 SET CSRDATA x      Change cursor data character, default is /
 QUERY CHARACTERS   Display current settings
 SET TRAPDD ddname  Trap into a permanent file
 SET TRAP ON | OFF  Trap command output and place in permanent file
 SET TRAP           Determine status of output trapping and ddname used
 QUERY TRAPPDD      Determine status of output trapping and ddname used

Library Space Reuse Facility



" Assists in preventing X-37 abends- Prevents frequent
  compressing of PDS datasets

" A space map member, $$$SPACE, is created by PDSMAN after a
  library has been compressed by IEBCOPY or if IEBCOPY is used to
  copy members into an empty library for which Library Space Reuse
  has been specified-

" The creation of the space map member, $$$SPACE, requires that
  there be 2 free tracks available-

" By design, the space map member appears to be an empty member
  and is invalidated if it is moved, such as occurs when it is
  copied to another library or when the library is migrated by HSM-
  PDSMAN recognizes this situation the next time the library is
  updated and dynamically re-creates the space map in these
  circumstances- This process, which should be regarded as normal,
  is accompanied by messages PDSM021-11 and PDSM021-12 indicating
  the attempted and successful space map recreation

" If the size of the member is not altered when the member is
  updated, Library Space Reuse normally replaces the member in its
  original location- If the member is altered, the space vacated by
  the replaced member is recorded but is useable only if no members
  follow in the same track (otherwise they would be erased by the
  formatting write operation)-

" Each time the library is compressed, the space map member is
  deleted by PDSMAN before the library is (re) created after the
  compression-

" When IEBCOPY is used to copy a group of members into an
  non-empty library for which space reuse is effective, space
  reuse is performed after all members have been processed, not
  after each individual member is copied-

" Some systems such as IMS, CICS, and LLA may maintain BLDL
  entries in storage for extended periods of time- In these
  situations, space belonging to a replaced member should not be
  reused while there is any possibility that the old version of the
  replaced member may still be accessed, either on the system
  performing the update or on a system with the library is shared-

" In libraries for which space reuse is effective, all alias
  names must be deleted from the library or replaced when the
  owning member is deleted or replaced- Failure to do so results in
  the alias entry pointing to a free space area that may be reused
  by a different member at a later time-

" When PDSMAN is not active on all systems in a multiple system
  environment, Library Space Reuse is effective only for updates
  performed by the system(s) on which PDSMAN is active- Members
  updated by the system(s) without PDSMAN are processed normally,
  with the areas vacated by replaced or deleted members marked as
  UNRECORDED- These unrecorded areas are not available for space
  reuse- The net effect is that Library Space Reuse, while still
  operational, is somewhat less effective- Compressing the library
  removes the unrecorded areas-



LLA Extensions



1- LLA Auto Update

" Eliminates the need for manual LLA intervention and the problem
  of accessing out-of- date members by updating LLA at the time the
  members update takes place


2- Extended LLA Commands


" Libraries can be added or removed from LLA, updated, or have
  their management mode changed directly from the console using new
  LLA commands such as F LLA,ADD DSN=<dsn>-
" No longer a need to edit parmlib members or learn LLA control
  statement syntax-
" These commands are available online and batch interfaces-


3- LLA Monitoring


" Continually examines the status of LLA, detecting and tracking
  all ADDs, REMOVEs, UPDATEs, and management mode changes that take
  place-
" This facility also provides positive acknowledgement that
  auto-updates or ELOCs have completed successfully-
" Optional messages provide an audit trail or when LLA
  modifications occurred-


4- Cross-System Notification

" All changes or updates to LLA managed libraries are reflected
  to all lpars in the sysplex-
" You no longer need to remember to refresh or update LLA on
  every system when a member is updated or LLA is modified-


5- LLA Reporting
" The LLACHECK report allows you to quickly diagnose situations
  where LLA returns an incorrect version of a module-
" The LLATRACE report provides a convenient method for reporting
  the contents of another useful diagnostic tool, the LLA Trace
  Table-
" Internal LLA statistics, including an indication of modules
  that have been staged to the Virtual Look-Aside Facility (VLF),
  are reported by LLASTATS-
