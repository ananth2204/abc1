//*           The original Microsoft Word versions are included     *   FILE 680
//*           here (you have to download them in BINARY to a PC     *   FILE 680
//*           in order to read them).  And also included in this    *   FILE 680
//*           file, are EBCDIC text versions.  Some of the screen   *   FILE 680
//*           illustrations that were in the Microsoft Word         *   FILE 680
//*           originals, could not be captured in the text          *   FILE 680
//*           versions.                                             *   FILE 680
//*                                                                 *   FILE 680
//*           Included are courses on REXX, ISPF, TSO, how to use   *   FILE 680
//*           Edit Macros, and PDSMAN/EZYEDIT.                      *   FILE 680

//*           Much valuable information can be gleaned from         *   FILE 680
//*           these course outlines.  There is so much detail in    *   FILE 680
//*           the Edit Macro, ISPF, REXX, and PDSMAN courses,       *   FILE 680
//*           that you can probably learn a great deal, even if     *   FILE 680
//*           you are quite expert in those subjects already.       *   FILE 680
//*           Bruce is very systematic in what he presents.         *   FILE 680
