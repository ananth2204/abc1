EDITPDS



1. Description

" A home-brew utility that allows us to execute an Edit Macro
  against all members in a PDS.


2. Syntax

" TSO  EDITPDS  'pds-name' <edit-macro>
" ISPSTART CMD(EDITPDS 'pds-name' <edit-macro>)


3. Items of Interest

" In-order for you to use this utility the last command in your
  edit macro must be "ISREDIT END" or "ISREDIT CANCEL".  This is
  essentially the same as you pressing the PF3 (END) or PF12
  (CANCEL) key when in edit mode.
